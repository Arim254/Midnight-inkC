    "body": "US President Donald Trump, flanked by Navy Secretary John Phelan (R), announces the US Navy's new Golden Fleet initiative, unveiling a new class of frigates, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

[and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms that include FAST channels like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect.You want to be excited about someone new and feel a deep connection to them. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag.1. The relationship makes you feel on edgeIn your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay.Mixed signals, hot and cold affection, and inconsistency can then feel intimate rather than anxiety-inducing. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry.What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. Does your nervous system settle when you are around them or are you always on edge? If it's the latter, that may be a signal that the feeling you have isn't chemistry, and that this person makes you feel unsafe.2. The highs and lows feel addictiveThe emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves.What to do: Your body needs to learn how to slow down and feel safe again. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload.3. You keep going back to themBeing drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. You believe that you can make it right this time. You might also recreate painful dynamics that mirror your past because you can predict what happens, and this gives you a false sense of control.What to do: Self-reflection is important here. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. 4. Jealousy feels excitingIf it feels exciting when your partner is jealous, this isn't chemistry — it is your insecurity rearing its head. You might even do something on purpose to trigger their jealousy in order to feel closer to them or make them prove to you that you are wanted. In your mind, this might sound like, \"If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough,\" or, \"If they chase me, it means they love me enough.\"What to do: Work on yourself so your validation comes from within, not from other people. Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. 5. Things are never calmSteady connection should feel grounding and safe. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, \"If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt.\"The lack of spark doesn't mean there isn't chemistry. It might just mean there isn't anxiety. What to do: Teach your body that it's okay to feel calm. When you feel like you want to create conflict or chase a thrill, stop and notice that. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass.Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like.Dr. Amy Tran is a clinical psychologist.

    "body": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesIt's been two days since news broke that Nvidia was spending $20 billion to acquire top talent from Groq in what the chip startup called a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, hasn't issued a press release or regulatory filing and, according to a spokesperson, is only confirming the contents of Groq's 90-word blog post published after the close of holiday-shortened trading on Wednesday. \"They're so big now that they can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release and nobody bats an eye,\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, in a Friday interview with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" While neither company confirmed the price tag, CNBC learned from Groq lead investor Alex Davis on Wednesday that Nvidia had agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash. Davis' firm, Disruptive, has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq and led the startup's latest financing round in September at a $6.9 billion valuation.Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the startup said in the post, adding that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards.watch nowAs an acquisition, Groq would mark by far Nvidia's largest in its 32-year history. Its biggest prior purchase happened in 2019, when Nvidia bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion.But Nvidia is instead following a playbook used by other tech giants over the last couple years, spending billions of dollars to hire top talent in AI and to get access to key technology through licensing agreements. It's a strategy that's been employed by Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Nvidia itself previously used the tactic, shelling out more than $900 million in September to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.By avoiding traditional acquisitions, tech companies have been able to skirt some level of antitrust scrutiny and quickly close deals to bring in the people they most covet. \"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive,\" Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. His firm recommends buying Nvidia shares and has a $275 price target on the stock.Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% on Friday to $190.53. The stock has gained 42% this year and is up thirteenfold since the end of 2022, when generative AI started taking off following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.Nvidia has been using its expanding cash pile to spread capital across the AI ecosystem, including through recent investments in OpenAI and Intel. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.Widening the 'competitive moat'Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, the search giant's custom chips that are being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Groq's specialty is on the inference side of the market, which refers to the the use of AI to make decisions based on new information. Nvidia dominates the training piece of the market, which involves teaching AI models to learn from patterns in large amounts of data. Analysts at Cantor said in a report Friday that Nvidia is \"playing both offense and defense\" by snapping up Groq's assets, keeping them from potentially landing in the hands of a competitor. \"We think this acquisition only enhances Nvidia's full system stack and overall leadership in the AI market (and only widens its competitive moat),\" wrote the analysts, who kept their buy rating and $300 price target. BofA Securities analysts also maintained their buy recommendation and $275 target following the announcement. In a note Friday, they characterized the deal as \"surprising, expensive but strategic,\" and said it shows Nvidia recognizes that \"while GPU dominated AI training, the rapid shift towards inference could require more specialized chips.\"The analysts said that key questions remain, such as who will own Groq's language processing unit intellectual property, whether it can be licensed to Nvidia competitors and whether what's left of Groq — its nascent cloud business — could possibly \"undercut NVDA's LPU-based service with lower pricing.\"Nvidia isn't commenting on any of those details for now. The first opportunity analysts and investors will likely get to hear from the company will be Jan. 5, when CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to speak at CES in Las Vegas. — CNBCs David Faber contributed to this reportWATCH: Nvidia GPUs to Google TPUs — Breaking down all the AI chipswatch now",

    "body": "The internet was becoming mainstream in the late 90s, but Miro Mitev was head-down exploring something that wouldn't become popular for decades: AI.Now an asset manager, Mitev was an early adopter of AI in finance after discovering the capabilities of neural networks in 1997 while studying at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.He told CNBC he saw the potential of neural networks for financial forecasts. \"I fell in love with these kinds of possibilities,\" he said.Mitev spent his 25-year career forecasting for banks and tech firms like Siemens. He founded SmartWealth Asset Management, whose decisions are made entirely by a network of AI systems. Its latest fund, IVAC, is eyeing $2 billion in assets under management and has an annualized returns target of 14-15%.Despite no human involvement in the AI's decisions, Mitev said that \"humans are the most important part of the equation\" as they're the ones selecting training data, inputting variables, building the parameters, and consistently tweaking the model. Once a model is created, \"it's very dangerous to start intervening,\" Mitev said. Indeed, trusting the model is his golden rule, he added.watch nowInstead, humans should ensure that there are no errors in the data or calculations, and introduce new data so that the model is up to date.\"The worst is to overrule the results, and this is what happens very often,\" Mitev said, adding that people \"don't trust\" AI at first. \"Even if we, as humans, don't see the result now, if we look back after two months, three months, we say, 'Oh, actually, we were wrong,'\" he added.The forces driving the market — optimism, pessimism, speculation — are very human. Even the European Central Bank has warned that the current AI bull run may be driven not by detailed technical analysis but by fear-of-missing-out. Mitev said that taking the emotion out of investing proves better results; SmartWealth Asset Management has seen gains of 407.63% across a 10-year period to Nov. 1 2025, compared with an industry benchmark of 145.34% over the same period, according to a graph a representative for the firm shared with CNBC. It's \"not possible\" to know what will happen in one year, Mitev said, but he can see up to one month ahead with his model. \"Evaluating this information and making informed decisions based on this consistently proves to be providing better results than the human.\"Read moreThe constant monitoring and introduction of new data are important points, given that AI systems do \"hallucinate\": generating false information. Mitev said models' mistakes were down to \"overfitting,\" data issues or model misspecification.Overfitting is where the algorithm pays too much attention to what Mitev called \"noise.\" He said this was data \"which is not meaningful\" because it doesn't reveal a true cause-and-effect relationship with stock performance. Rigorous design, validation, and live environment testing, serve as an antidote to this, Mitev added. It means that, although his fund strategy is executed entirely by a series of algorithms, humans still play a crucial role in making sure it's effective.\"It's actually a process that evolves over years ... and this is the reason why in-house development of these kind of technologies is very important,\" he added – especially for anyone looking to differentiate their AI play.",

    "description": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headline",
    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "When I think back on my childhood, my happiest memories aren't tied to things I owned. They're about the freedom of growing up in a small Ohio town where everyone knew your name and kids ran in packs.The neighborhood park was our meeting place. A few bikes tossed in a friend's front yard signaled the game was on. There were no texts or group chats. But childhood today often looks different. Connection revolves around gaming consoles, phones, sneakers, and the next must-have gadget. If you can't afford it, you risk being left out.That contrast led me to talk to my 79-year-old dad, a man who wears thriftiness the way others wear luxury. He genuinely enjoys finding new ways to save money. He never tried to keep up with anyone. While others rushed to buy the newest car or gadget, he was content with what he had. That mindset made him the quintessential millionaire next door.He helped shaped my relationship with money. I don't feel compelled to chase status or possessions. Here are eight lessons from my frugal dad that have stood the test of time — and how they still apply today.1. Let your values guide your financial decisionsEvery dollar you spend is a vote for the life you want to build. When your spending aligns with what matters most, money feels less like sacrifice and more like purpose. For couples especially, shared values turn financial decisions into a source of clarity instead of conflict.2. You can always earn more money, but not timeImagine you could swap places with legendary investor Warren Buffett, now 95. Would you? Time is scarce and unrecoverable, unlike money. Remember this when deciding whether to take a promotion just for a bigger paycheck, even if it means less time with family; or working longer hours for a fancier car when your current one works fine; or buying a bigger house when your kids already attend a great school in a safe neighborhood.3. The best investment you can make is in yourselfThe returns on personal growth compound for decades. Education, learning a new skill, reading widely, or even investing in therapy can strengthen both your earning potential and your resilience. In a partnership, personal growth benefits everyone — stronger individuals make stronger teams.4. Debt steals tomorrow’s optionsEvery borrowed dollar limits future freedom. A loan may feel manageable today, but it quietly shapes your choices tomorrow, from the jobs you can take to where you can live. Prioritizing flexibility over financing buys peace of mind and the ability to pivot when life changes.5. Turn off the lights when you leave the roomTurning the lights off is a metaphor for the small things we do. It’s more than about saving a few cents on electricity; it’s a mindfulness practice. Every small act of frugality adds up, and it builds awareness of how we use our resources. 6. Celebrate simplicityA quiet life is often an intentional one. Choosing simplicity means choosing time over things, presence over pressure, and meaning over noise. Less clutter often leads to less stress — and more room for what actually matters.7. New cars destroy wealthThe average new car now sells for over $50,000, and when you factor in financing, fuel, and insurance, monthly costs can exceed $1,200. Vehicles that are about three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability. Investing the difference between new and used can significantly boost long-term net worth.8. Being cheap and being frugal aren’t the same thingCheapness cuts corners at all costs. Frugality focuses on getting value for your money. A frugal person maintains what they own, spends intentionally, and is generous where it counts. Understanding that difference can prevent endless money conflicts because frugality builds a meaningful life, while cheapness slowly erodes joy.Brian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk speaks at a Q&A session following a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | Pool | ReutersThree months ago Oracle named Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as its new CEOs. They're off to a rough start.Oracle shares have plummeted 30% so far this quarter. With four trading days remaining in the period, the stock is on pace for its sharpest decline since 2001 and the dot-com bust. Investors have grown skeptical about the database software vendor's ability to open more server farms for ChatGPT operator OpenAI, which agreed in September to spend more than $300 billion with Oracle.Earlier this month, Oracle reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and free cash flow. On the earnings call, newly appointed finance leader Doug Kehring called for $50 billion in fiscal 2026 capital expenditures, 43% higher than the plan in September and double the total from a year earlier. Additionally, Oracle is plotting $248 billion in leases to boost cloud capacity, on top of building data centers.Such growth will require boatloads of debt. In September, Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry. Kehring committed on the earnings call to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating. But some skeptical investors are betting otherwise, pushing up the prices of Oracle's credit default swaps.\"Considering Oracle is already barely hanging on to an investment grade rating, we would be concerned about Oracle's ability to live up to these obligations without restructuring its OpenAI contract,\" analysts at D.A. Davidson wrote in a note to clients on Dec. 12. They have the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. Oracle declined to comment.watch nowMagouyrk and Sicilia's tenure began at a time of historic optimism. About two weeks before they took the reins from Safra Catz, Oracle reported a 359% revenue backlog tied heavily to OpenAI's commitment. That deal represented a major endorsement for Oracle, which was left off Gartner's list of top five cloud infrastructure providers by revenue for 2024.Following reports about the OpenAI agreement on Sept. 10, Oracle's stock shot up almost 36%, the third-sharpest rally since the company's 1986 IPO. The shares reached an intraday record of $345.72.\"We think $340 was terrifying,\" said Zachary Lountzis, vice president at Lountzis Asset Management, in an interview. Lountzis held $25 million in Oracle shares as of Sept. 30, according to a filing.The stock has since lost 43% of its value, closing on Wednesday at $197.49, though it got a bump last Friday after TikTok said it had agreed to sell part of its U.S. business to Oracle and other investors. Oracle has for years delivered cloud services to TikTok.Not 'betting against Larry'Lountzis said his team first bought Oracle shares in 2020, when the stock was below $60. It's held onto it stake through the recent highs and lows, picking up another roughly 30,000 shares in the first quarter of this year.\"Our philosophy is that we're OK with short-term overvaluation if the economics of the business have not changed, and that was the case with Oracle,\" Lountzis said. \"We didn't feel the economics of the business changed with all the largely positive news that came out. And I think what we've seen from $340 down to $180 is actually a very healthy correction.\" For Lountzis, much of his trust in the company comes down to Larry Ellison, who founded Oracle in 1977 and is now the world's second-richest person, according to Bloomberg.\"You would have gone bankrupt 40 times betting against Larry over the last 50 years,\" Lountzis said. \"He sees the future.\"watch nowIn October, Sicilia, Magouyrk and Kehring laid out a vision for a much faster-growing Oracle, with revenue set to step up to $225 billion in the 2030 fiscal year from $57 billion in fiscal 2025. Most of that growth will come from artificial intelligence infrastructure, with Nvidia's graphics processing units at the center of it. But while Magouryk was telling analysts to prepare for \"hypergrowth,\" such expansion would come at the expense of profitability, because Oracle's core software business commands much higher margins.  In fiscal 2021, Oracle's gross margin was 77%. Analysts polled by FactSet see it falling to about 49% in 2030, with about $34 billion in total negative free cash flow over the next five years before that figure turns positive in 2029.Eric Lynch, managing director at Florida's Suncoast Equity Management, said it's hard as an investor to get comfortable with Oracle's plans. \"Four or five years is a long time,\" Lynch said. \"That's just not within our investment discipline.\"Lynch also said he's worried about such heavy dependance on OpenAI, which is burning cash at a rapid rate and has committed to more than $1.4 trillion in total AI build-outs and investments. \"Will the demand be there from OpenAI?\" Lynch said.Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin launched coverage of Oracle earlier this month with the equivalent of a buy rating and a $280 price target. He said the industry's perception will likely improve if Oracle follows through with OpenAI, which could account for more than one-third of the company's revenue by 2029, according to Turrin's estimate. \"They're kind of shifting away from more of a value-oriented business to a more growth-oriented business,\" Turrin said.A big challenge for Oracle remains picking up market share in cloud infrastructure, where the company badly trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google even though its customer roster includes names like Meta, Uber and Elon Musk's xAI.Databricks, which was just valued at $134 billion in a funding round, doesn't make its popular data processing software available on Oracle's cloud. That will happen \"when customers start banging on my door, saying, 'You need to run on Oracle,'\" Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview. \"Maybe it's getting there, but we just haven't heard that.\"Databricks rival Snowflake hasn't brought its services to Oracle either.Turrin said that Oracle's credibility in the market will hinge on the success of its AI build-out. \"Then customers start to look at this and say, wow, this company was trusted to build some of the largest training clusters in the world, and they're delivering on them,\" Turrin said. \"We should take a look at that too and figure out what's happening here.\" WATCH: How the massive power draw of generative AI is overtaxing our gridwatch now",

    "body": "Different types of leather are seen at the Rio of Mercedes cowboy boot factory, on July 31, 2025, in Mercedes, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt | AFP | Getty ImagesBootmaker Twisted X — known for its Western footwear — was thrown into chaos overnight when President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on imports in April. The company turned a conference room at its Decatur, Texas, headquarters into a \"tariff war room\" as import costs on its finished work boots surged, shipments were paused mid-transit and invoices fluctuated so wildly that staff found themselves recalculating margins by the hour. \"A lot of other leather companies had to pause shipments because of the chaos and it felt like prices were going all over the place before you could take account,\" Twisted X CEO Prasad Reddy told CNBC. \"It was a very uncertain time.\"Twisted X wasn't alone. Leather retailers big and small are facing similar challenges, and the result has been higher prices at the register that are unlikely to come down anytime soon.  Pre-tariff inventory is gone, while replacement orders cost far more. The products hitting shelves now were manufactured with more expensive hides, subjected to pricier foreign processing and shipped with higher freight costs than last year's merchandise, industry experts said. The Yale Budget Lab projects that leather goods prices will remain elevated by nearly 22% for at least the next one to two years, driven by inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and heavy tariff exposure, particularly across China, Vietnam, Italy and India. \"The reason why leather is hit so hard is twofold,\" said John Ricco with the budget lab. \"No. 1, some of these tariff rates that are the highest are placed on different countries where we import most leather. The second reason is that we just import a lot of leather, and, more broadly, apparel-related products from these trading partners than we make.\"The costs have already shown up for brands like Tapestry, owner of handbag makers Coach and Kate Spade. Executives told investors in August that tariff-related expenses could total $160 million, warning of \"greater than previously expected profit headwinds\" moving forward.Chasing low costsA pair of Twisted X boots starts the way most U.S. leather goods do: as a raw, salted cow hide from an American ranch. That hide is shipped overseas, usually to Asia, to be tanned into leather. For Twisted X, roughly half of its products are tanned in China, down from 90% in 2017, Reddy said. Once turned into leather, the material typically is shipped to another factory — often in China, Vietnam, Mexico or India — to be cut, stitched and assembled, before finally returning to the U.S. as a finished product. Under normal conditions, that global supply chain kept costs low. But reliance on foreign production backfired when the new duties took effect, Reddy said. \"When tariffs happened, everything stopped,\" said Kerry Brozyna, president of the Leather and Hide Council of America. \"So they [China] couldn't take shipments in because if they took them in and they computed in the price of the tariff, they wouldn't be able to sell them.\" Currently, the U.S. leather trade deficit is one of the widest in manufacturing. In 2023, the U.S. imported $1.37 billion in leather apparel while exporting just $92.7 million, a roughly 15-to-1 deficit, according to the Census Bureau. China alone supplies about one-third of all leather goods imported into the U.S.\"Being so reliant on many overseas productions methods ended up hurting many people in the industry in the beginning when they didn't know exactly what was going to happen,\" Reddy said. \"At Twisted X, we have been working for a while to reduce reliance on China.\" As the duties took effect, Twisted X and many other leather companies rushed to exit China and encountered new problems: bottlenecks in Cambodia and Bangladesh, longer lead times in Vietnam, and a sudden 50% tariff on many Indian leather exports imposed in August. By late summer, nearly every leather company was paying more at every stage — for hides, tanning, assembly and re-importation, according to Reddy. \"We saw all our channels to make boots keep getting more expensive until we were able to figure out a good solution,\" Reddy said. Conglomerates like Steve Madden are also feeling the impacts. \"The third quarter was challenging, driven largely by the impact of new tariffs on goods imported into the United States,\" Edward Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Steve Madden, said on an earnings call in November.Price increasesMany companies absorbed what they could, but that buffer is fading, Ricco said. Despite rerouting supply chains and moving production, Twisted X said it still had to raise prices around 1% to 3% this year. \"We look at it as a success,\" Twisted X's chief marketing officer, Tricia Mahoney, told CNBC. \"Many competitors were looking at bigger increases and but we made sure to prioritize our customers and keep the prices as stable as possible. Next year could be tough but we are more prepared than ever.\"Already, leather luxury prices are up. Chanel's iconic Classic Flap bag is about 5% more expensive than it was last year, after yet another round of price hikes this spring, according to luxury retail pricing data.But, by 2026, the leather industry's price shock will likely be more prominent, Ricco said. Analysts expect prices for leather footwear and accessories to rise roughly 22% over the next year or two and around 7% long term as higher tariffs, freight costs and scarce premium hides move through the system. \"2026 is going to probably be where rubber meets the road,\" Ricco said. \"They [leather companies] have to make these decisions about whether to pass cost increases on to consumers, whether to cut jobs and whether to reduce payments to shareholders.\"Domestic declinesWorkers at the Rio of Mercedes cowboy boot factory put the finishing touches on boots on July 31, 2025, in Mercedes, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt | AFP | Getty ImagesThe decline of a once-booming domestic leather manufacturing industry is also reducing the options companies have to pivot away from the global supply chain. In the 1950s, manufacturers employed more than 300,000 people in roughly 1,000 tanneries nationwide, mainly spread across the Midwest and Northeast, according to the Leather and Hide Council of America. The workforce has fallen to around 50,000 in 2025, with the number of tanneries dwindling to a few hundred, per the council. Reddy said the so-called golden age of domestic manufacturing is long gone. The burden of tariffs has had the steepest impact on brands that rely on finished goods from Asia — not companies sourcing leather domestically. So far, rather than restoring U.S. manufacturing, as the Trump administration had predicated the tariffs on, many brands have responded by reshuffling suppliers overseas to contain costs, according to industry experts.Women work in a leather factory in Kolkata, India, on November 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCattle shortagesU.S. leather companies are also dealing with a raw material shortage, as there are simply fewer cattle hides to work with.The U.S. cattle herd is at its smallest point since the 1950s following prolonged drought, rising feed costs and herd liquidation. Since hides are a mandatory byproduct of dairy and beef production, fewer cattle mean fewer hides — even as global demand for top-grade leather persists for handbags, upholstery and footwear.\"Few cattle means that what hides are left makes it more expensive to produce boots with high-quality leather that we use,\" Reddy said. For shoppers hoping for a discount by trading down for a synthetic, alternatives haven't been spared either. Many faux-leather and polyurethane materials rely on petrochemical inputs sourced from Asia, which also fall under the new tariff schedules. Retailers and industry analysts said synthetic footwear and handbags are seeing mid- to high-single-digit cost increases, according to industry estimates.",

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. \"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. watch now\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

    "body": "Getting a bachelor's degree isn't the only way to land a lucrative job anymore. Resume Genius's latest report identified the jobs that offer the highest pay without requiring a four-year college degree, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.The report demonstrates that \"there's no one way to get a high-paying job,\" according to Resume Genius career expert Eva Chan. \"All of the jobs do have some degree of training, some have schooling, but they're all very attainable without a degree,\" she says.Blue-collar jobs like electrical power-line installer and repairer are becoming increasingly popular, according to Chan.\"Maybe 10 to 15 years ago, they weren't seen as lucrative,\" Chan says, but more people are realizing that blue-collar roles and skilled trades can offer \"high pay\" and plenty of growth opportunities.Management and sales roles like insurance sales agent are ideal for people who have strong interpersonal skills, according to Chan.\"Your pay can increase pretty quickly if you're consistent and you're good with building relationships,\" she says. According to Resume Genius, these are the 15 highest-paying jobs that don't require a college degree, as well as each job's median annual salary, median hourly wage and estimated job growth over the next decade.1.

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)Warren Buffett is going into his last week as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the vehicle he has used to generate incredible wealth for himself, and for the company's loyal longtime shareholders, over the past six decades.Since he took control in 1965, Buffett has transformed a struggling textile company into a massive conglomerate worth more than $1 trillion.His Class A shares account for almost all of his estimated total net worth of $151 billion, which puts him in the #10 slot of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.He would be No. 2 on that list with roughly $359 billion if he held onto the hundreds of thousands of Berkshire B shares, currently valued at $208 billion, that he's been giving away since 2006, with more donations to come.Given all the success he's had with the company, it may be surprising to hear him call Berkshire \"the dumbest stock I ever bought\" ... a blunder that has cost him hundreds of billions of dollars.From the deep recesses of CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive, here's a rare clip of Buffett in 2010 with an in-depth explanation for Becky Quick of why he never should have bought Berkshire Hathaway and the important lesson he learned from his costly mistake.BECKY QUICK: All right.  Warren, thank you very much for joining us today.WARREN BUFFETT: My pleasure.BECKY QUICK: What we're trying to get to the bottom of is what was the worst trade you ever made and what'd you learn from it?WARREN BUFFETT: The dumbest thing I ever did?  (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: Yeah, the dumbest thing you ever did.WARREN BUFFETT: The — the dumbest stock I ever bought — was — drum roll here — Berkshire Hathaway. And — that may require a bit of explanation.  It was early in — 1962, and I was running a small partnership, about seven million. They'd call it a hedge fund now.And here was this cheap stock, cheap by working capital standards or so. But it was a stock in a — in a textile company that had been going downhill for years. So, it was a huge company originally, and they kept closing one mill after another. And every time they would close a mill, they would — take the proceeds and they would buy in their stock. And I figured they were going to close; they only had a few mills left, but that they would close another one. I'd buy the stock. I'd tender it to them and make a small profit.So I started buying the stock. And in 1964, we had quite a bit of stock. And I went back and visited the management, Mr. (Seabury) Stanton. And he looked at me and he said, 'Mr. Buffett. We've just sold some mills. We got some excess money. We're going to have a tender offer. And at what price will you tender your stock?'And I said, '11.50.' And he said, 'Do you promise me that you'll tender at 11.50?' And I said, 'Mr. Stanton, you have my word that if you do it here in the near future, that I will sell my stock to — at 11.50.' I went back to Omaha. And a few weeks later, I opened the mail —BECKY QUICK: Oh, you have this?WARREN BUFFETT: And here it is: a tender offer from Berkshire Hathaway — that's from 1964. And if you look carefully, you'll see the price is —BECKY QUICK: 11 and —WARREN BUFFETT:  — 11 and three-eighths. He chiseled me for an eighth. And if that letter had come through with 11 and a half, I would have tendered my stock. But this made me mad. So I went out and started buying the stock, and I bought control of the company, and fired Mr. Stanton. (LAUGHTER)And we went on from there.Now, that sounds like a great little morality table — tale at this point. But the truth is I had now committed a major amount of money to a terrible business. And Berkshire Hathaway became the base for everything pretty much that I've done since. So in 1967, when a good insurance company came along, I bought it for Berkshire Hathaway. I really should — should have bought it for a new entity.Because Berkshire Hathaway was carrying this anchor, all these textile assets. So initially, it was all textile assets that weren't any good. And then, gradually, we built more things on to it. But always, we were carrying this anchor. And for 20 years, I fought the textile business before I gave up. As instead of putting that money into the textile business originally, we just started out with the insurance company, Berkshire would be worth twice as much as it is now.  So —BECKY QUICK: Twice as much?WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. This is $200 billion. You can — you can figure that — comes about. Because the genius here thought he could run a textile business. (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: Why $200 billion?WARREN BUFFETT: Well, because if you look at taking that same money that I put into the textile business and just putting it into the insurance business, and starting from there, we would have had a company that — because all of this money was a drag. I mean, we had to — a net worth of $20 million. And Berkshire Hathaway was earning nothing, year after year after year after year. And — so there you have it, the story of — a $200 billion —Incidentally, if you come back in ten years, I may have one that's even worse. (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: If you — if you had to look at a moral for that story, though, is it don't cut off your nose to spite your face?WARREN BUFFETT: I would say — I would say that no matter whether you cut off your nose to spite your face or whatever, if you get in a lousy business, get out of it. I mean, it — it was — it was a terrible mistake, just because I drifted into it, in a sense. And — and I've always said that if you want to be known as a good manager, buy a good business. (LAUGHTER)That's the way to do it. And everyone will think you're smart.And when I'm in a good business, like people think, 'Boy that guy's smart.' And when I'm in a dumb business, like textiles, and don't know what I'm doing, you know, or shoes later on, or whatever it may be, you know, all that other — if you think you're a managerial genius, just try yourself in a bad business.BECKY QUICK: Is that the lesson that you learned from it?WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.BECKY QUICK: But — and that is something that you've actually put into practice?WARREN BUFFETT: I've actually put a line in my annual report many, many, many decades late — ago, after doing this. And I said, 'When a manager with a reputation for brilliance, meets up with a business with a reputation for bad economics, it's the reputation of the business that remains intact.'BECKY QUICK: (LAUGHTER) So that is a lesson you carried with you? And yet, it's one that is — you're reminded of every single day. It's Berkshire Hathaway.WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. And every now and then, I get tempted. Because I started out with Ben Graham in 1950 or so. And his whole idea was buying things that were cheap.You don't want to buy things that are cheap. You want to buy things that are good. It's much better to buy something that's good at a fair price, than something that is cheap at a bargain price.And I wasn't — I didn't start out that way.  I — I was taught a different system. But — but if I didn't learn from Berkshire Hathaway, I'll never learn. (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: How long did it take you to figure out this lesson? You said it was —WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it took me 20 years to give up on the textile business. I — I had a wonderful guy running it after — after Seabury Stanton — a fellow named Ken Chase ran it. And he was terrific. Honest and able, hardworking. And he couldn't make it go.But we just kept working at it, trying — we bought another textile company called Waumbec Mills in Manchester, New Hampshire. Another mistake.If you're going to be brilliant with a lousy business, why not be brilliant with a good business?BECKY QUICK: But really, how — it took 20 years for you to finally give up on it. When did you kind of figure, oh, this is not working? Was it — did it — was it really 20 years? Or did you kind of know —WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it was — no. I figured it out fairly soon. But I just kept thinking I'm not going to give up on this. And incidentally, we had a work force that was terrific. I mean, it — it was — we weren't done in by anything except competitive dynamics. And I — we'd buy new equipment, or we would move — we would add this mill in Manchester, and we'd say, 'Look at all those synergies,' and all that. Nothing works.I — In fact, I used to have a desk in my drawer. And they would keep sending me these things that if we buy this machine, we'll save 14 people. If we buy this machine, we'll save 12 people. I kept putting it in my drawer. With all those machines, we'd save more people than we had at the start of the — supposedly, we were operating with zero people. But it doesn't work that way.BECKY QUICK: Is there any business that you didn't get into because you thought, wait a second, I've been down this road before? Where you were tempted and you kind of pulled back?WARREN BUFFETT: I get calls on them every day. You know, I mean, I get calls — not every day. I mean, it's an exaggeration. But I get calls frequently on businesses that are just too tough. And — and people say, you know, why don't you tackle it? You know, got all these resources now and good managers.But the interesting thing about business, it's not like the Olympics. In the Olympics, you know, if you do some dive off the — on a high board and have four or five twists — (LAUGHTER) on the way down, and you go in the water a little bad, there's a degree of difficulty factor. So you'll get more points than some guy that just does a little headfirst dive in perfectly.So degree of difficulty counts in the Olympics. It doesn't count in business.  Now, you don't get any extra points for the fact that something's very hard to do. So you might as well just step over one-foot bars instead of trying to jump over seven-foot bars.BECKY QUICK: You know, people will say, well, wait a second. You're in some businesses that some people have written off for dead: the newspaper business. How is that different?WARREN BUFFETT: You're right. (LAUGHTER) But — but we bought that [The Buffalo Evening News] in 1977.  And — and we've done very well over the years.  At — at first, we didn't do so well. But then we did very well.But I — the newspaper business of 2010 is not the newspaper business of 1977. I mean, it is diametrically different. [Berkshire sold the newspaper in 2020.]And it is true, and we put it in the annual report, that we run Berkshire in a way that they don't teach in business schools. Because in business schools, they say sell off your so-so businesses and keep buying new businesses. I call that gin rummy management.And when I — if I had 50 kids, you know, and one of them isn't doing quite as well as the others, I'm not going to put him up for adoption. Unless they are going to lose us money permanently, or if they have major labor difficulties, we keep the businesses that aren't as good as the others.So, if I'm going to follow that philosophy, I'd better be very careful about what I buy, right?BECKY QUICK: Exactly. What about your business partner, Charlie Munger? What would he say your biggest mistake is?WARREN BUFFETT: Well, he would probably repeat this. And I would say I've learned a lot about what I just got through talking about — I've learned a lot from Charlie.Charlie told me this from the first moment I met him in 1959. He said — he said exactly — I could have — I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I'd just listened to him. But what did Charlie know? (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: OK.  Warren, thank you very much.  We really appreciate your time.WARREN BUFFETT: Thanks.  Thanks for having me.Some links may require a subscription:NPR's The Indicator from Planet Money podcast: The worst year of Warren Buffett's careerCNN Business: How to put some of Warren Buffett's best money and life advice to work for youBusiness Insider: Warren Buffett's company took Kraft Heinz off its subsidiary list weeks before board exit and $5 billion writedownInvestopedia: What Warren Buffett's Snowball Metaphor Teaches Us About Life and Long-Term SuccessBerkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S. and Japan, by market value, based on the latest closing prices.Holdings are as of Sept. 30, as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Itochu, which is as of March 17, 2025, and Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

    "body": "watch nowLow oil prices give President Donald Trump more leverage over Iran, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday, speaking as the two adversaries teeter on the brink of another conflict. \"The world is very well supplied with oil right now, and I think it gives President Trump more leverage in his geopolitical actions to not worry about a crazy spike in oil prices,\" Wright told CNBC in an interview when asked about the risk of a supply disruption due to tensions with Iran. The oil market is closing monitoring tensions in the Middle East for any sign that crude supplies could be disrupted. U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $63.55 per barrel Friday. Prices are up more than 10% since the start of the year, after losing 20% in 2025. Oil market analysts are generally expecting a surplus this year after OPEC+ increased output and as U.S. production remains strong. Trump has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with military action if it does not negotiate over its nuclear program. The president threatened Iran with strikes in January during a mass uprising against the regime, but ultimately refrained. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in Muscat, Oman earlier on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\" Iran is an OPEC member and produces more than 3 million barrels per day. Wright expects production in Venezuela to grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day this year, after the U.S. captured former President Nicolas Maduro early in January. The U.S. has seized control of Venezuela's oil sales and President Trump is pressuring U.S. companies to rebuild its energy sector.\"It will be a substantial percent of global demand growth this year,\" Wright said of output growth in the South American nation. \"Venezuela is going to be another helpful stabilizer of energy markets.\"",

    "body": "Jennifer Garner, co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, center, and Cassandra Curtis, co-founder of of Once Upon a Farm, center right, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOnce Upon a Farm made its public market debut on Friday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"OFRM.\"The stock opened at $21 per share, up 16% from its initial public offering price. The shares closed on Friday up 17%.The organic children's nutrition company priced its IPO at $18 per share on Thursday, in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. Once Upon a Farm and backers sold about 11 million shares, raising $197.9 million and valuing the company at $724 million.Founded in 2015 by Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz, the Berkeley, California-based company sells a range of organic cold-processed, refrigerated baby foods and kid snacks. In 2017, actress Jennifer Garner and former Annie's Homegrown CEO John Foraker joined the company as co-founders. Garner sits on the company's board and holds the formal title \"Farmer Jen,\" while Foraker, whom she calls the \"Grand Poobah of organic,\" is CEO.\"We want to feed babies to big kids, as we're helping make parents lives easier,\" Garner told CNBC.Once Upon a Farm's market debut comes as shoppers and policymakers alike have pushed back on ultra-processed foods, particularly when consumed by children. For example, the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., has found evangelists in so-called MAHA moms, who agree with his opinions on everything from junk food to childhood vaccinations. The shift in behavior has hurt Big Food, while fueling growth for insurgent brands like Once Upon a Farm. In 2024, the company recorded net sales of $156.8 million, up 66% from the prior year, although its losses widened from $17.6 million to $23.8 million, according to a regulatory filing.\"With these tailwinds and consumer trends being in the right spot, we're really trying to take advantage of that and deliver more for consumers,\" Foraker said in an interview.Retailers have taken note of the shift and are allotting prime shelf space to organic foods, a far cry from Foraker's early days at Annie's, when its products were relegated to the undesirable \"organic\" corner in grocery stores, he said.Once Upon a Farm, which is officially designated as a public benefit corporation, aims to \"drive systemic change in childhood nutrition,\" according to its mission statement. Foraker said its commitment to that goal is why it chose to go public rather than seek a sale, a much more common ambition for upstart consumer goods businesses. While Foraker said he had a good experience with General Mills after it bought Annie's in 2014, he noted that across the food and beverage industry, many companies do not stick to the promises that they make to brands they are buying and honor their mission. (Look no further than the yearslong dust-up between Ben & Jerry's and its former owner Unilever and current parent Magnum Ice Cream Co., which spun out from the Dove owner last year.)Once Upon a Farm was planning to go public last year, before the longest-ever government shutdown disrupted those plans. The company plans to spend the IPO proceeds to pay down its debt, purchase new equipment and fund general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.Broadly, more IPOs are expected this year, thanks to interest rate cuts and a large backlog of companies that have been scared off by market volatility and recession fears. This week alone saw seven companies go public through IPOs that raised at least $150 million each, including Bob's Discount Furniture, according to Renaissance Capital data.",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.The firm is \"in the early stages\" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents \"soon,\" though he declined to provide a specific date.\"Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,\" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to \"constrain headcount growth\" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.watch nowGoldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. \"Claude is really good at coding,\" Argenti said. \"Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?\"Argenti said the firm was \"surprised\" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.Now, the view within Goldman is that \"there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,\" he said.The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was \"premature\" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.\"It's always a trade-off,\" Argenti said. \"Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure are justified, appropriate and sustainable, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\"The reason for that is because all of these companies' cash flows are going to start rising,\" Huang said. Nvidia shares closed up nearly 8% on Friday. Huang's comments come after key Nvidia customers Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft reported their latest earnings over the past two weeks. These companies told their investors that they plan to dramatically increase spending on AI infrastructure. In total, these hyperscalers could spend $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with much of that spending going toward buying Nvidia's chips. Wall Street had a mixed response to the surging spending, sending Meta's and Alphabet's stocks up, but punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Huang said that the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" is being driven by \"sky high\" demand for computing power, which AI companies and hyperscalers can use to make more money. He cited specific examples of what Nvidia customers are doing with AI. Meta is using AI to move from a recommendation system that ran on CPUs to a system that uses generative AI and agents, Huang said. He said Amazon Web Services' usage of Nvidia chips and AI will affect how the retail giant recommends products, and that Microsoft will use Nvidia-powered AI to improve its enterprise software. He also praised OpenAI and Anthropic, the two leading artificial intelligence labs, which both use Nvidia chips through cloud providers. Nvidia invested $10 billion in Anthropic last year, and Huang said earlier this week that the chipmaker will invest heavily in OpenAI's next fundraising round. \"Anthropic is making great money. Open AI is making great money,\" Huang said. \"If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues would go up four times as much.\"He said that all the graphics processing units that Nvidia has sold in the past — even six-year old chips such as the A100 — are currently being rented, reflecting sustained demand for AI computing power. \"To the extent that people continue to pay for the AI and the AI companies are able to generate a profit from that, they're going to keep on doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling,\" Huang said.

    "body": "Nastco | GettyBitcoin tumbled toward $60,000 this week as investors reassessed its utility. And while there isn't one clear catalyst driving the bloodbath, one thing is clear: the crypto market is in crisis. \"There's nothing going on in the marketplace that should have necessitated this type of a crash,\" Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, told CNBC. \"And so I think that's made people, frankly, more fearful. ... You have to ask yourself, 'is it over for bitcoin?'\"Bitcoin fell as low as $60,062 on Thursday, bringing it to its lowest level since Oct. 11, 2024. That's more than 52% off from its record high of $126,000 hit in early October 2025.  The previous session marked one of bitcoin's bloodiest ever, with the token shedding more than 15% on the day. Its daily relative strength index fell to 18, putting the asset in extremely oversold territory. As of Thursday, other digital assets like ether and solana were also down 24%  and 26% for the week to date, respectively — a sign investors' confidence in the entire crypto market is faltering.Bitcoin bounces, but losses loom largeBitcoin was rebounding on Friday, with the token last trading at $69,631.97, up more than 9% on the day.But, its recent drawdown has prompted investors to reevaluate its utility, including its role as a digital currency or as a store of value. Simultaneously, institutional appetite for the flagship crypto appears to be waning as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds record outsized outflows, threatening to drive bitcoin deeper into the red. \"This time is markedly different from other bear markets, however, in that it's not in response to a structural blowup,\" Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at crypto market-making firm Wintermute, said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"It's a fundamentally macro-driven deleveraging tied to positioning, risk appetite and narratives rather than systemic failures within crypto itself.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin prices over the past yearOver the past few months, investors have grown increasingly skeptical of efforts to recast bitcoin as \"digital gold,\" or an alternative to traditional safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin is down 28% over the past 12 months, while gold is up 72% during the same period — a testament to the latter's utility as a hedge against macro risks. Conversely, bitcoin has often traded down alongside other risk-on assets such as equities amid periods of high macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, raising doubts about its utility as a safe haven. Nearly a week after Trump's \"liberation day\" tariff announcement on April 2, 2025, bitcoin had fallen about 10% to below $80,000, while the S&P 500 had declined roughly 4%. Separately, investors are also reassessing the extent to which financial institutions, treasury firms and governments are willing to adopt bitcoin — a major catalyst for the token in recent years. Large institutional outflows are mounting as investors brace for bitcoin to go lower, thinning liquidity for the token, according to a recent analyst note from Deutsche Bank.Those outflows are also noticeable among spot bitcoin ETFs in recent months, according to the investment firm. The funds have seen outflows of more than $3 billion in January, in addition to roughly $2 billion last December and about $7 billion last November.Additionally, a swath of Strategy copycats that emerged over the past year or so have slowed or paused their bitcoin purchases amid the digital asset's correction. Finally, traders have acknowledged that longtime efforts to market bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies have largely faded. While Steak 'n Shake and Compass Coffee have rolled out support for bitcoin payments in recent years, initiatives to make the asset a form of payment have largely died, particularly as interest in dollar-pegged stablecoins grows, according to Bitwise's Ryan Rasmussen. \"We're seeing Wall Street adopt stablecoins because it is a fundamental transformation of the way payments work, and bitcoin is just a different asset. It's not meant for that today,\" Rasmussen said, arguing that the token's purpose has evolved from that of a currency to a decentralized, nongovernable store of value. \"I've never paid for coffee or a sandwich with bitcoin, and I never will.\"And beyond those more immediate concerns, investors are also increasingly worried that bitcoin's underlying network could be hacked, driving the token to zero. \"It certainly is a risk that is seeing more attention from investors as they're getting more worried about [it], and I think you're seeing a little bit of that risk priced into bitcoin,\" Rasmussen said.He noted that Bitwise has allocated funds toward efforts to mitigate the threat from quantum computing.Nevertheless, traders' appetite for bitcoin has largely dwindled, denting its price. That's true even as long-time believers are still proudly betting on bitcoin, despite of the charts and the naysayers. \"I believe that the story is intact,\" said Scaramucci, adding that he bought bitcoin for his fund on Thursday. \"But, I don't have a crystal ball. … Who the hell knows?\"",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon shares sunk more than 5% on Friday after the company's hefty spending forecast surprised investors who were already wary that the artificial intelligence boom is at risk of becoming a bubble. The e-commerce company on Thursday was the latest tech giant to announce plans for a massive increase in capital expenditures, after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta all signaled they expect their spending sprees to continue. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported about $120 billion in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter alone. That figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, which is higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel.Wall Street has responded differently to the companies' spending plans, cheering Meta and Alphabet's forecasts, while punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google and Oracle collectively lost more than $1 trillion from their valuations over the past week, according to FactSet data. Amazon shed just over $300 billion from its market cap, the most out of the group. Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI build-out will likely face continued volatility as \"sentiment contagion takes hold,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC.\"Questions over the extent of capex as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,\" he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAmazon shares over the past month'Investors questioning every angle in AI race'Amazon announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report that its capital expenditures are expected to reach $200 billion in 2026, which was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. While management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning.\"We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race.\"Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded Amazon's stock on Friday to neutral from a buy rating over concerns around its spending plans, risks to its cloud dominance and the potential for AI to erode its retail business. \"With the context of results from Microsoft and Google, we see AWS continuing to lose its lead and now scrambling to catch up through escalating investment,\" the analysts wrote in a research note. \"We are also increasingly concerned about Amazon retail's transition to a new chat-driven internet dominated by Gemini and ChatGPT.\"Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as \"staggering\" demand for the iPhone. \"The bet is becoming binary,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC, referring to the huge investments in so-called Magnificent Seven companies. \"Either a big pay off if these investments come good, or a huge waste of shareholder's cash if it goes wrong.\"— CNBC's Annie Palmer and Elsa Ohlen also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speaks to reporters after the weekly Senate Republican caucus policy luncheon at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 13, 2026.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe rapper Nicki Minaj supports it. Elon Musk says it's critical to sustain American democracy. The SAVE America Act voter identification bill emerged this week as a hot topic in hard-line Republican circles and now may advance in Congress next week.The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives next week amid a pressure campaign from right-wing commentators and many in the congressional GOP. It sets up a showdown with Democrats and voting-rights advocates, who say such a proposal could disenfranchise millions of Americans, and with Senate Republican leaders, who are fielding calls to change the filibuster and clear a path to passage.\"America's Elections are Rigged, Stolen, and a Laughingstock all over the World. We are either going to fix them, or we won't have a Country any longer,\" Trump posted to Truth Social on Thursday. The president urged passage of a bill dubbed the SAVE America Act, which would require government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot and proof of citizenship to register to vote.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump posts racist image of Obamas, White House defends it and slams 'fake outrage'Sen. Slotkin refuses DOJ interview request over troops video: ‘The intimidation is the point’Hillary Clinton wants testimony on Jeffrey Epstein in public: ‘Let’s stop the games’Trump would decide whether to investigate Fed pick Warsh over refusal to cut rates: BessentDemocrats are among those who have bristled at the proposals, which are rooted in Trump's unfounded claims that elections are rife with fraud and come in the context of the president's recent comments about nationalizing elections and the FBI raid of a Georgia election office last week where Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this week that the voter ID proposal would be \"dead on arrival\" in the Senate and likened the bill — introduced by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, in the House and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in the Senate — to \"Jim Crow 2.0.\"According to the Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available and 2.6 million Americans lack government-issued photo ID of any kind. Low-income and minority voters are more likely to lack the types of documents that would be required by a national voter ID law, leading to less voting participation by those groups.\"The documentary proof of citizenship provisions would be extremely burdensome for a lot of Americans. Most Americans don't have a driver's license or ID that indicates that they're a U.S. citizen,\" Nicole Hansen, policy counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said in an interview.\"We really view the bill as part of a broader effort by the president and his allies in Congress to sow the seeds to question election results in 2026 that they don't like,\" Hansen said.The general concept of voter ID requirements has broad public support, with voting-rights advocates cautioning the devil is in the details. According to an August 2025 Pew Poll, 95% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats favor voter ID. A 2024 Gallup poll found that 84 percent of Americans support voter ID and 83 percent support proof of citizenship to register to vote. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and documented cases are rare.\"The American people are clear: they support Voter ID and agree that only U.S. citizens should vote in our elections,\" Roy said in a statement Thursday. But with Democrats vowing to block the bill, Senate passage is unlikely. Because of Senate procedural rules and the balance of the power in that chamber, Democratic votes are needed for legislation to advance there.A separate proposal, also introduced by Roy and similarly called the SAVE Act, would have barred noncitizen voting but did not have a voter ID component. Federal law already bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections, but there are provisions for them to vote in some lower-level elections. The House voted 220-208 in favor of the bill in April, with four Democrats in support, but it has not yet gotten a vote in the Senate.That has caused some members to call for eliminating the filibuster as it has been practiced since the 1970s and revert back to a \"standing filibuster\" — made famous by the movie \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" — which requires dissenting members to actively hold the floor in order to block legislation.\"The modern-day filibuster is a perversion of how the Senate was supposed to function. Instead of arguing positions and attempting to pass legislation, it has become a way to avoid doing the work and to block the President's agenda in the name of institutional supremacy, even though most of the senators got elected with help from POTUS,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., one of the most vocal in the House group calling for the passage of a voter ID law, posted to X this week.Luna, during an appearance on Punchbowl News' \"Fly Out Day\" podcast, floated the idea of tacking the SAVE America Act onto larger, must-pass legislation down the line.\"We should nuke what's called the zombie filibuster, which is the ability for Democrats to filibuster it without lifting a finger and that we should require an old-fashioned talking filibuster,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Newsmax this week.But Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has promised a vote on a version of the Republican election bill, expressed skepticism about filibuster reform.\"We will get a vote on the SAVE Act at some point,\" Thune said at a press conference earlier this week. \"With respect to the filibuster, I think we all know where the votes are on that.\"",

    "body": "Rafael Henrique | SOPA Images | APThe stock of Hims & Hers fell Friday after a legal threat from Novo Nordisk.The online teleheath company announced on Thursday plans to launch a cheaper, copycat version of Novo's weight loss pill, prompting Novo to take legal action.Hims stock spiked as much as 15% on the news in Thursday trading, but quickly pared gains and ended the session down 3.8% at a 12-month low after Novo said the action was \"illegal.\" Shares fell as much as 10% more on Friday before paring losses. It was last trading about 2% down. Hims said it will launch a Wegovy-style pill containing the same active ingredient as the original brand, semaglutide, for as little as $49 for the first month when customers sign up for a subscription. After the first month, the price will rise to $99. That's significantly lower than the $149 Novo Nordisk sells its starting dose for on its direct-to-consumer website NovoCare. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHims & Hers stock has been volatile over the past year.Hims is launching its pill even though semaglutide has patent protection in the U.S. until 2032. The telehealth firm's business flourished when it started selling compounded semaglutide in an injectable format, using a loophole in U.S. regulation that allows competitors to sell a drug protected by intellectual property laws if the drug is in short supply.In the early days of the Wevovy jab, demand significantly outstripped supply, but Novo Nordisk has since invested heavily in manufacturing capacity and resolved the supply issues. There are no shortages reported for the pill version.Hims says that its versions are \"personalized\" in dosage, and therefore legal. Novo says the action is illegal and a risk to patient safety. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement Thursday.Hims is a volatile stock, inherently tied to its perceived ability to sell weight loss drugs like its Wegovy copy. Shares have hit highs of $69 and lows of roughly $21 in the past 12 months.Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny, who rates Hims stock at \"Market Perform,\" suggested the telehealth provider could also consider launching copycat versions of Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs. Lilly didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.Meanwhile, Barclays analyst James Gordon called the $49 Wegovy copy a \"new concern\" for Novo.\"While compounded alternatives may attract cost-sensitive patients in the near term, questions remain about their regulatory sustainability and clinical consistency,\" he added.

    "body": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, speaks during an unveiling event in New York, Feb. 26, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon's stock plunged 11% in extended trading Thursday, dragged lower by market jitters around the company's $200 billion capex plans, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies. The forecast is a sharp increase from Amazon's capital expenditures last year, and it was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. The company reported spending roughly $131 billion on purchases of property and equipment in 2025, up from about $83 billion in the year prior.  Tech companies have laid out aggressive spending plans on artificial intelligence infrastructure since OpenAI ushered in the modern era of this technology with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, but at the start of 2026, those lavish commitments have only kept growing. Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday said it would spend up to $185 billion in 2026, while Meta last week said its capital expenditures could nearly double from last year to somewhere between $115 billion and $135 billion in 2026On a conference call with investors, Wall Street analysts pressed Amazon executives for more clarity around the spending blitz and when it could begin to pay off. CEO Andy Jassy said in prepared remarks at the beginning of the call that he was \"confident\" that company's cloud unit will see a \"strong return on invested capital,\" though he didn't say when it could materialize.\"Help us, get to that — get to your level of confidence in having a strong long-term return on that invested capital,\" Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said to Jassy. Jassy said the company needs the capital to keep pace with \"very high demand\" for Amazon's AI compute, which requires more infrastructure such as data centers, chips and networking equipment.\"This isn't some sort of quixotic, top-line grab,\" Jassy said. \"We have confidence that we, that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital. We've done that with our core AWS business. I think that will very much be true here as well.\"Sales at Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.6 billion in the most recent period, beating analysts' expectations and marking the cloud unit's \"fastest growth in 13 quarters,\" Jassy said. AWS could've grown faster if it had more capacity to meet demand, \"so we are being incredibly scrappy around that,\" he said. The company's cloud unit added almost 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025, and AWS expects to double that power by the end of 2027, Jassy noted.Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked Jassy how he sees the AI market evolving from the current landscape, where it remains \"a bit top-heavy with a lot of the spend clustering around a few of the AI-native labs.\"Jassy said the AI market has become more like a \"barbell,\" with the AI labs on one side and enterprises on the other end, looking to the technology as a \"productivity and cost avoidance\" tool. The middle is comprised of enterprises that are in various stages of building AI applications, he said. \"That middle part of the barbell very well may end up being the largest and most durable,\" Jassy said.

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesThis tax season, some families could see a bigger tax break for their children due to changes from President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"Enacted in July, Trump's legislation permanently increased the maximum child tax credit to $2,200 per child for 2025, up from $2,000. That value will be indexed for inflation starting in 2026.  If you previously qualified for the full $2,000 credit, the update could trigger a $200 bigger refund or a $200 lower tax bill per kid, for your 2025 return, depending on your situation, experts say.     Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

What to expectAs ACA subsidies expire, health costs emerge as top economic worry for votersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedIn 2025, some 90% of families with children received the child tax credit, and the average tax break per family was $2,520, according to the Tax Policy Center.Nearly 37 million returns claimed the child tax credit or credit for other dependents during tax year 2022, based on the latest IRS estimates.Here are some key things to know about the tax break, including who qualifies and how to calculate your credit. Who qualifies for the child tax credit  Families must meet certain rules to claim the child tax credit, including age, relationship, support, residence requirements and more.  Kids must have a valid Social Security number and be under age 17 at the end of 2025. If a married couple filing jointly claims the credit, one filer also must have a Social Security number. The IRS outlines other guidelines here. The child tax credit starts to phase out, or get smaller, once income exceeds $200,000 for single filers or $400,000 for married couples filing taxes together. \"It's not based on any expenses you incur,\" Margot Crandall-Hollick, a principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told CNBC. \"It's based on your earnings … and if you have a kid that qualifies.\"  By comparison, another tax break for families, known as the child and dependent care tax credit, partially reduces up to $6,000 of care expenses for two or more \"qualifying individuals\" — typically children under age 13 — when parents who file taxes jointly both earn income. Families with a single qualifying individual can look to offset up to $3,000 of care expenses.watch nowHow the child tax credit worksFor 2025, the maximum child tax credit is up to $2,200 per child. If the credit exceeds your taxes owed, you can claim the \"refundable\" portion, up to $1,700 per kid, which is known as the additional child tax credit, or ACTC. Many lower-income filers don't owe a tax balance.\"You get more benefit if you have some tax liability to make up that $500 difference,\" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida. His firm is ranked No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025.After the first $2,500 of earnings, the child tax credit value is 15% of adjusted gross income, or AGI, until the tax break reaches $2,200. Meanwhile, ACTC is capped at 15% of earnings above $2,500.The $2,500 earnings minimum and $1,700 refundability cap means millions of lower-income families won't receive the full $2,200 credit in 2026, according to a January analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

    "body": "watch nowThe NFL plans to hold talks with non-traditional media companies to potentially sell them the rights to a live game, NFL Media chief Hans Schroeder told CNBC Sport on Friday.\"We have other people that are both partners in a smaller sense — maybe not a full package — or people that still are in the media landscape somewhere that would like to be an NFL live game partner,\" Schroeder said in an interview from Radio Row ahead of Super Bowl LX in San Francisco. \"We're going to have those conversations,\" he added. \"We want to understand all our options and how to think about the best model for us, for our fans, for our teams going forward. So to your question, you know, we're going to listen and probably have a lot of different people that want to have a conversation with us. That's very fortunate. We say that humbly, and we're going to make sure we have those conversations to understand.\"Schroeder didn't offer details on which companies could be interested in buying a live game. The NFL sold a week one game to YouTube last season for about $100 million -- a one-off strategy that it could replicate with other digital platforms. The societal-wide shift to streaming has made digital a comparable rival to broadcast TV, which has long been the league's preferred distribution strategy due to its reach.\"Now you see these big digital platforms that can reach broadcast level audiences,\" Schroeder said. \"That just creates more optionality.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The NFL and its traditional media partners — Disney, Paramount Global, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Amazon — will likely begin discussing a new media rights later this year, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause, according to people familiar with the matter. Schroeder echoed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's comments to CNBC in September that the league would be open to having those talks.\"I'm sure they're doing work on their end when the time's right, because they either want to sort of press the 'engage' button or the commissioner says, 'Hey, let's go do this,'\" Schroeder said.The NFL is expanding the number of international games to nine next season — a record high. The league may sell a new package of some of those games to a media partner as soon as next year, he said.\"That'll be one of the things we look at,\" Schroeder said.",

The post stayed up for about 12 hours.Trump late Friday during a gaggle with reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One said that he won't apologize for the post. \"I didn't make a mistake,\" he said.Trump told reporters that he didn't watch the whole video, just the beginning.\"I didn't see the whole thing,\" Trump said. \"I looked at the first part, and it was really about voter fraud in the machines, how ‌crooked ‌it is, how disgusting it is.

    "body": "The Google Midlothian Data Center in Texas, Nov. 14, 2025.Ron Jenkins | Getty ImagesAlphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend nearly $700 billion combined this year to fuel their AI build-outs.For investors who love cash above all else, some warning signs may be flashing. With the heart of tech earnings season wrapping up this week, Wall Street has a clearer picture of how the artificial intelligence race is poised to accelerate in 2026. The four hyperscalers are now projected to increase capital expenditures by more than 60% from the historic levels reached in 2025, as they load up on high-priced chips, build new mammoth facilities and buy the networking technology to connect it all.Getting to those kinds of numbers is going to require sacrifice in the form of free cash flow. Last year, the four biggest U.S. internet companies generated a combined $200 billion in free cash flow, down from $237 billion in 2024. The more dramatic drop appears to be ahead, as companies invest heavily up front, promising future returns on investment. That means margin pressures, less cash generation in the near term and the potential need to further tap the equity and debt markets. Alphabet held a $25 billion bond sale in November, and its long-term debt quadrupled in 2025 to $46.5 billion.Amazon, which on Thursday said it expects to spend $200 billion this year, is now looking at negative free cash flow of almost $17 billion in 2026, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, while Bank of America analysts see a deficit of $28 billion. In a filing with the SEC on Friday, Amazon let investors know that it may seek to raise equity and debt as its build-out continues.watch nowDespite beating on revenue for the quarter, Amazon saw its stock sink almost 6% on Friday, bringing its drop for the year to 9%. Microsoft is down 17%, the most in the group, while Alphabet and Meta are up slightly. While Amazon laid out the most aggressive spending plan among the megacaps, Alphabet wasn't far behind. The company, which is investing in its cloud infrastructure business as well as its Gemini models, sees up to $185 billion in capex this year. Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" that he's projecting even more spend in coming years, with Alphabet shelling out up to $250 billion in 2027.Pivotal Research projects Alphabet's free cash flow to plummet almost 90% this year to $8.2 billion from $73.3 billion in 2025. Analysts at Mizuho wrote in a report that bearish investors may look at the potential doubling of capex this year as \"leaving limited FCF in 2026 with uncertain\" return on investment.Still, the analysts remain bullish and all kept their buy recommendations on the respective stocks. Longbow Asset Management CEO Jake Dollarhide is right there with them. He counts Amazon as the biggest holding in his portfolio, followed by Alphabet at fourth and Microsoft ninth. \"If you're going to pour all this money into AI, it's going to reduce your free cash flow,\" Dollarhide said. \"Do they have to go to the debt markets or short-term financing to find the optimal mix of equity and debt? Yeah. That's why CEOs and CFOs are paid what they're paid.\"'Somewhat shocking'Analysts at Barclays now see a drop of almost 90% in Meta's free cash flow, after the social media company said last week that capex this year will reach as high as $135 billion. They kept their overweight rating even as they forecast an even tougher cash position the next two years. \"We are now modeling negative FCF for '27 and '28, which is somewhat shocking to us but likely what we eventually see for all companies in the AI infrastructure arms race,\" the analysts wrote in a note after earnings. When Meta CFO Susan Li was asked on the earnings call about capital allocation and the company's plans for future buybacks, she responded that the \"highest order priority is investing our resources to position ourselves as a leader in AI.\"At Microsoft, where capex is going up but at a slower rate than at its tech peers, Barclays estimates that free cash flow will slide by 28% this year before popping back up in 2027. Representatives from Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta declined to comment. watch nowA big advantage the tech industry's most-valuable companies have over high-flying AI upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic is that they've accumulated a massive cash pile in recent years. As of the end of the latest quarter, the four leaders had a total of over $420 billion in cash and equivalents. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report on Thursday about Alphabet that the company's infrastructure build-out is creating a \"meaningful moat.\" It's a sentiment shared broadly by industry executives and experts who view AI as a generational opportunity with revenue reaching will into the trillions. Businesses today are testing and building new AI agents to handle all sorts of tasks, including developing applications with just a few text prompts. All of that advancement requires hefty amounts of compute, which the cloud providers say is creating insatiable demand for their technology. \"Between what's happening in business and enterprise — they are all building on these AI companies Google, Meta, Amazon,\" Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told CNBC in an interview \"These are core technologies.\"  Morgan Stanley's Nowak said Alphabet is \"seeing a lot of signal on return when it comes to Google Cloud, return on Google search and YouTube.\" And Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on his company's earnings call that growth at Amazon Web Services was \"the fastest we've seen in 13 quarters.\"But plenty of unknowns remain, and some skeptics worry that a slipup at OpenAI, which has announced over $1.4 trillion in AI deals, could lead to a market contagion because so much of the AI industry's growth prospects are tied to the ChatGPT creator. \"The truth is, we're at the dawn of a new technology shift and it's really hard to know the sustainability of top line,\" Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm MoffettNathanson, told CNBC. \"We're entering new times and predicting the top line has gotten a lot harder. There's a ton of surprising going on.\"— CNBC's Deirdre Bosa, Jordan Novet, Annie Palmer and Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026.Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced the launch of TrumpRx — a direct-to-consumer website that is key to his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. The president said millions of Americans would save money through the platform. But it's still unclear if all patients — particularly those with insurance coverage — will see more cost savings from using that site to buy their medicines than they would through existing methods. TrumpRx targets people who are willing to pay with cash and forgo insurance, which suggests that patients without or with limited coverage may benefit the most. \"You're going to save a fortune and this is also so good for overall health care,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night unveiling the website.The site does not sell drugs directly to American patients, but acts as a central hub that points them to drugmakers that are offering discounts on certain products on their own direct-to-consumer sites, or gives them discount coupons to take to pharmacies. For example, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were already offering their blockbuster obesity drugs at hefty discounts to cash-paying patients, even before the reductions Trump touted on Thursday.Clicking on the platform's offer for Lilly's popular Zepbound weight loss injection sends consumers to the company's LillyDirect platform, where they can order the treatment and submit prescription details.A screenshot of a Zepbound order on the TrumpRx website.\nPreview\nFilters\nSource InfoIn recent months, Lilly, Novo and at least 14 other drugmakers have negotiated agreements with the Trump administration to participate on the platform and voluntarily sell certain medicines at a discount to Medicaid patients. Those landmark deals are part of Trump's broader \"most favored nation\" policy, which pushes to link U.S. drug prices to the lowest ones abroad.At launch, the site features only medications from the first five companies to strike pricing deals with the administration: AstraZeneca, Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, according to a White House fact sheet. It will list drugs from other companies \"in the coming months,\" the administration said.The platform is the government's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations — and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.But TrumpRx \"doesn't seem like it is the only solution\" to that issue for most Americans, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization. The cash-pay offerings could be better deals for patients without insurance, but it's difficult to assess exactly how many people stand to benefit from TrumpRx, she added. \"If they're able to get a drug covered by their insurance at a relatively affordable copay, then there's not a great upside to using the TrumpRx website,\" Cubanski said. She said people with insurance coverage who buy through direct-to-consumer platforms may also not have their purchases count toward their benefits, which means it doesn't help them meet their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. But Cubanski said there's potential for TrumpRx to be helpful in expanding access to certain drugs at more affordable prices, particularly medicines not covered widely by insurance in the U.S., such as obesity drugs. Medicare will start covering weight loss treatments for the first time later this year as part of the deals Lilly and Novo struck with Trump, but many employers are still hesitant to cover those drugs. Still, many of the other products expected to be listed on TrumpRx are already widely covered through insurance, and some are available as cheaper generics from competing drugmakers. Questions about savingsQuestions remain about how much savings people can expect if they buy their medicines at direct-to-consumer prices. The announced price reductions for certain drugs are framed as steep cuts from their so-called retail list prices. For example, under Novo Nordisk's agreement with the administration, some doses of its diabetes drug Ozempic will be priced at $350 per month on TrumpRx, which is less than half of its roughly $1,000 monthly list price. But those list prices are often far higher than what private insurers and government programs ultimately pay for medicines after rebates, discounts and other concessions, according to researchers at Georgetown's Medicare Policy Initiative. That suggests some payers may already be securing prices comparable to — or lower than — the newly announced discounts on medications under the Trump deals. The Georgetown researchers cited one study that found that average discounts on brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D run around 40% of list prices. Meanwhile, discounts in Medicaid exceed 75%, according to a Congressional Budget Office study. In the private sector, \"we've got insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiating lower prices and designing an insurance benefit that enables people to benefit from those price negotiations,\" said KFF's Cubanski. \"My guess is that for most drugs, at least most brand-name medications, people are likely to get a better deal using their insurance rather than purchasing a drug through a direct-to-consumer website,\" she said. Drugs on TrumpRxAt the launch of the site, the administration listed a range of major drugs as available for discounts, with a particular emphasis on popular GLP-1 products:Ozempic injection for diabetes, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,000Wegovy injection for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,350Wegovy pill for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: $149 per month for the starting dosesZepbound injection for obesity, made by Eli Lilly: starting at $299 per month, down from $1,086The White House also put an emphasis on cash-pay discounts for fertility drugs like Gonal-F from EMD Serono, which was listed at $168. Dozens of other drugs that companies expected to be be listed on the platform were not as of Thursday night. Those include key treatments from companies including Amgen, Merck and Gilead, among others.In an interview with CNBC at a conference in January, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has multiple products on its existing direct-to-consumer platform, which first offered a cash-pay discount on its blood thinner Eliquis. That platform will eventually link to TrumpRx, he said. The company is going to examine ways to put additional products in its portfolio on its own platform, \"where it makes sense,\" Boerner added. He said Bristol Myers is \"aligned with the administration\" on the issue of the U.S. health care system being too complex, and said several middlemen can increase costs. \"What we like about these [direct-to-consumer models], where they make sense from a business standpoint, is you're able to circumvent some of that,\" Boerner said. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNBC last week, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients, and that TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" Ricks said.",

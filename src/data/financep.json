    "body": "American Express announces the new platinum business card.Courtesy: American ExpressAmerican Express is finding that even for a provider of credit cards to the affluent, it pays to focus on the highest of high rollers.The company recently shifted marketing dollars to its refreshed Platinum card, which carries an $895 annual fee, and away from no-fee cash back cards, CEO Stephen Squeri told analysts Friday after the company reported fourth-quarter results.Doing that helps to boost overall spending levels as high-end consumers continue to thrive, a tactic that leads to both rising fee revenue from premium cards and lower loan defaults, executives said.\"We have the ability … to be really flexible with our marketing investments, and we saw a tremendous demand for premium products, particularly the Platinum card,\" Squeri said.\"The overall portfolio is slowly getting more premium [as] the Platinum portfolio is growing at a very fast pace,\" he added.AmEx's strategy shift is the latest example of the so-called \"K-shaped\" U.S. economy playing out, in which wealthy consumers continue to spend freely while others rein in their expenses. Data from the card company shows that demand for high-end products and luxury experiences is accelerating, while purchases in more basic categories rises at a slower pace.Spending at luxury retailers surged 15% in the quarter, business and first-class airfare purchases rose 9%, and luxury hotel spending was up 12%, CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC in an interview.Meanwhile, spending at airlines and lodging more generally was up 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter, showing that the richest cardmembers are driving results.Card growth slowingThe commentary helped allay fears from analysts that the relaunch of the pricey Platinum card last fall hadn't gone well.AmEx said Friday that new card accounts hit 2.9 million at year-end, a decline from the third quarter and the lowest figure in the past five quarters, as the company focused on its more profitable card products. \"We are incrementally worried that the Platinum Card refresh isn't generating much traction,\" said BTIG analysts led by Vincent Caintic, citing new competition from other card issuers and consumer weariness over high fees and cumbersome perks.While the company doesn't disclose its total number of cardmembers, including for the Platinum card, Squeri told analysts Friday that \"all of the metrics that we look at speaks to the fact that this was a wildly successful product launch.\"Still, shares of AmEx were down about 3.5% in midday trading after the company's results and guidance disappointed some. Earnings per share of $3.53 were a penny below the consensus estimate, according to LSEG. That was due in part to higher-than-expected expenses, at $14.5 billion, driven by the costs of the Platinum refresh, the company said.\"If there is a rub, perhaps it is that 4Q clearly shows the cost of the Platinum refresh, but doesn't show a corresponding bump on new accounts,\" wrote Truist analyst Brian Foran in a research note.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks on Friday said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs could be a major catalyst for the rollout of the company's closely watched experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron.In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Ricks said Lilly expects to have Medicare coverage for the treatment \"immediately following that launch, and that will change the game a bit too.\" He said that's because many patients are currently paying in cash for competitor Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill for obesity. That launched earlier this month and is off to a strong start, even with spotty insurance coverage. Ricks said he noticed that nearly all of the early adopters of Novo's Wegovy pill are new to GLP-1 treatments rather than users of existing injections, so \"it's expansive, it's reaching more patients and that's great.\" He added that Lilly is confident in its pill's ability to compete and is preparing for a \"full launch\" in the second quarter. The rollout is set to coincide with Medicare starting to cover obesity medicines for the first time later this year under drug pricing deals Lilly and Novo struck with President Donald Trump in November. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThat government coverage will bring the price point of pills even lower in the second half of the year, Ricks said. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.\"That opens up things pretty wide, and we'll see where we can go from there,\" Ricks said. Medicare coverage of obesity treatments is a long-awaited move that some health experts say could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Ricks estimates that 20 million to 30 million Medicare beneficiaries who are suffering from obesity and related health conditions could be eligible for GLP-1 treatments, so coverage is a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool.\"Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. The agreements involve drugmakers voluntarily offering their medications for less, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices abroad, and guaranteeing that so-called most-favored nation pricing for new medicines.But Ricks said volume growth of Lilly's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.' \"We think that's a positive balance for us, but time will tell,\" he said, adding that it will be based on uptake of the treatments among Medicare patients and the company's share of that adoption. Lilly will share more details on the financial impact of the deal when it posts its fourth-quarter earnings and 2026 guidance next week, he said. The price agreements include commitments to launch drugs at discounted cash-pay prices on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx. That site, which was expected to launch in January, is not yet live.Ricks said Lilly was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients through the company's platform, LillyDirect, and TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" he said.",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersA federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday convicted a former Google software engineer of stealing trade secrets related to the search company's AI technology.The jury found 38 year-old Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets related to stealing thousands of pages of confidential information from Google to benefit the People's Republic of China, according to court documents. \"In today's high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google's AI technology on behalf of China's government,\" said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division, in a statement Friday. \"Today's verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation's most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.\"The case marks the first conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. Google executives and U.S. leaders have been vocal about the AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and China. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently told CNBC that Chinese AI models might be \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western capabilities.The jury's decision comes after Ding was originally indicted in 2024. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California oversaw the 11-day trial that led to Thursday's decision. Between May 2022 and April 2023, Ding stole more than 2,000 pages of Google's AI trade secrets and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account, the DOJ said Friday. At the time, Ding had been affiliated with two tech companies based in China and was in the process of creating his own tech company.The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture of Google's custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and the company's graphics processing unit systems, according to the DOJ. The trade secrets also included details about Google's custom-built SmartNIC, a specialized network interface card that enables high-speed communication across its AI supercomputers and cloud networking systems.Ding's attorney Grant Fondo reportedly argued that Google didn't do enough to protect the information. He argued that the documents in question were available to thousands of employees and therefore could not have contained trade secrets, adding \"Google chose openness over security,\" according to Courthouse News Service.Ding, whose next court date is Tuesday, faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, according to the DOJ.\"We're grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement to CNBC.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stakewatch now",

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

    "body": "watch nowChevron CEO Mike Wirth said Friday that Venezuela has taken positive steps to protect investment by private oil companies since the Trump administration captured former President Nicolás Maduro.Venezuela on Thursday passed reforms to its hydrocarbon law that ease state control of the oil industry and grants private producers more autonomy. Wirth said Chevron is still reviewing the legislation. The CEO said security of contracts, commercial stability and regulatory predictability are key to attract investment in Venezuela. \"We see Venezuela taking steps in a positive direction to address those issues, which will encourage investment, not only from a company like ours, but from others that I think are also considering the opportunities there,\" Wirth told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" in an interview. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Treasury Department. It is currently producing about 250,000 barrels per day through joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. Wirth said Friday that Chevron could increase production in Venezuela by up to 50% over the next 18 to 24 months if the company receives authorization from the U.S. government.Wall Street largely views Chevron as the U.S. oil company best positioned to benefit from the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela due to its presence in the country and its relationship with PDVSA. \"We've stayed when others didn't,\" Wirth said. \"We're getting paid back some debts that we're owed, and it does give us a significant head start. And the country has tremendous long-term potential.\"The CEO said the security situation is mostly stable where Chevron operates though there are areas of Venezuela that are less safe. \"We've got good, strong safety protocols and security protocols in place in the country,\"  Wirth said. \"And our operations have continued uninterrupted through this entire period of time.\"Chevron reported fourth-quarter earnings on Friday that beat estimates. The oil major increased production in 2025 by 12% worldwide and 16% in the U.S. to record levels.While Chevron is ready to ramp up production, competitor Exxon Mobil is wary of returning to Venezuela after its assets were seized twice in the past. Exxon CEO Darren Woods has called the country uninvestable. He told CNBC on Friday that the country needs to transition to democracy for investment to make sense.President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Chevron shares were trading up 1.4% after reporting its results. The stock has gain nearly 14% since the start of the year, outpacing the broader market. ",

    "body": "watch nowThe Senate on Friday evening passed a deal to fund federal agencies and give lawmakers more time to work out disputes over the Department of Homeland Security. The package of five bills, plus a two-week stopgap measure for the DHS funding, passed 71-29.The deal's passage in the upper chamber of Congress will not prevent a partial government shutdown from beginning a few hours later.That's because the House of Representatives, which also must vote to approve the final version of the deal, isn't scheduled to return to Washington until Monday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on a House GOP conference call earlier Friday afternoon that he will back the Senate-passed funding deal in light of President Donald Trump's support for it, MS NOW reported. Johnson said he hopes the House will pass the bill Monday, according to MS NOW. Once it is approved by the House, the spending package will be sent to Trump to sign.In the meantime, a partial shutdown of federal operations is set to begin at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday.The agreement stripped out funding for the Department of Homeland Security and included five other bills to appropriate money for government agencies.The deal called for DHS, which has been the target of scathing criticism by Democrats over its aggressive immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, to be temporarily funded by a stopgap measure, with the question of long-term funding to be revisited later.The deal had stalled in the Senate as a few Republican holdouts kept lawmakers from quickly considering the package.South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham earlier Friday refused to lift the hold he placed on the measure unless he was \"guaranteed a vote\" on his bill to criminalize so-called sanctuary city policies. Graham wanted to impose criminal penalties on state and local officials \"who willfully interfere with the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\"He also wanted an amendment to address the so-called Arctic Frost investigation by then-special counsel Jack Smith. That amendment would have required officials to notify senators if their phone records are obtained in a criminal investigation.The House last week included language in the spending package to repeal a law that would have allowed senators to sue for up to $500,000 if their phone records were obtained during Arctic Frost.

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

Thompson, 50, was fatally shot on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024, while walking to an investors' event for his company's parent, UnitedHealth Group. The third count accused Mangione of the murder of Thompson through the use of a firearm during that alleged stalking. That count, which the judge tossed out, would have made Mangione eligible for a possible death sentence. The fourth count, which was also dismissed, accused Mangione of the use of a firearm equipped with a silencer during the stalking.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

Jane Rosenberg | ReutersThe judge, who admitted that the analysis she applied to that argument \"may strike the average person — and indeed many lawyers and judges — as tortured and strange,\" ruled that Supreme Court precedent bound her to conclude that the first two counts did not meet the definition of \"crimes of violence.\"\"The motion is GRANTED.\"Separately on Friday, Garnett dismissed a motion by Mangione's defense team to suppress the contents of the backpack in his possession when he was questioned and detained by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after Thompson's killing.A police search of that backpack initially found a loaded gun magazine, and then later a handgun, a silencer, and a red notebook, among other items.

    "body": "watch nowIn his first stint at the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh came to a central bank that was about to be asked to save the world. He returns now under very different circumstances, asked to serve a notoriously fickle president who will place significant but very different demands on him.Warsh indeed is a Fed veteran, serving during the critical period of 2006 to 2011 that led up to and ultimately through the global financial crisis and the central bank's efforts to stabilize the economy. Appointed by President George W. Bush, Warsh was one of the youngest members ever to serve on the board of governors.While at the Fed, Warsh played an important role in the design and implementation of emergency lending programs aimed at stabilizing credit markets. Warsh also played a key role in helping devise the myriad programs aimed at rescuing the economy. One of those programs, developed separately at the Treasury Department, became known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, developed by Neel Kashkari, who is now the Minneapolis Fed president.However, Warsh emerged from the era as a Fed critic. He warned that large-scale asset purchases and near-zero benchmark interest rates ran the risk of distorting markets and undermining long-term price stability. While supporting the earlier efforts, Warsh voted against the second round of Fed bond buying, a program known as quantitative easing.Read more CNBC news on Kevin WarshWho is Kevin Warsh?

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty Images'Central casting'Warsh has further criticized the post-financial crisis Fed with going too far in monetary policy stimulus, contending that it is helping sow the sees for further crises. In some respects, President Donald Trump is appointing a Fed chair who may be even less inclined to accommodate political pressure than Jerome Powell.Trump cited Warsh's extensive background in announcing his appointment to the top Fed post Friday morning. Warsh is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University.\"On top of everything else, he is 'central casting,' and he will never let you down,\" the president posted on Truth Social.Warsh, is a Stanford University graduate who earned his law degree from Harvard and ultimately married into the Lauder cosmetics family. Before joining the Fed, he worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley and served in the George W. Bush White House as a special assistant to the president for economic policy.While positioning himself as a defender of Fed independence, Warsh also has criticized it for mission creep and told CNBC in an interview last year that the central bank needs \"regime change.\"Warsh made his misgivings known about the current Fed. \"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during that July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Despite multiple missteps on policymaking, Chair Powell has largely been able to keep the Fed consensus together. However, in recent months that has faltered, with each of the past several meetings featuring at least one and sometimes multiple dissents. Warsh's appointment would mark a sharp philosophical shift from Powell's pragmatic, consensus-driven approach and signal a potential tightening of the Fed's tolerance for inflation and balance sheet expansion. He would fill the seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday.Miran told CNBC on Friday that he supports the pick.\"Chairman-designate Warsh has a long history of being an innovative and original thinker on monetary policy,\" Miran said. \"He's got a number of really important insights over the years, and I'm really excited to see all the good work he's going to do at the Fed.\"watch nowCan Warsh sway the Fed committee?But if Trump thinks Warsh will be able to just push through aggressive rate cuts with ease, he might be in for an unpleasant surprise. Multiple voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee have expressed resistance to cutting further until there's more evidence that inflation is definitively moving towards the central bank's 2% inflation goal. Moreover, the full group of Fed officials in December indicated they see just one more rate cut coming in 2026, then another in 2027. In the aggregate, that's in line with market expectations, with futures traders pricing in two reductions this year and none next year.Traditionally, though, the chair has been first among equals when it comes to voting on the FOMC, so Warsh may be able to tilt the group in at least a bit more dovish direction.\"We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"Because he has a hawkish reputation and is seen as independent, he is better placed to bring the FOMC along with him to deliver at least two and plausibly three cuts this year than some rivals.\"So while Warsh may prove an ideological ally of the administration, how that translates into action will be a key question.\"Analytically, we expect he will be strongly aligned with the Administration's arguments that booming productivity will allow for neutral or accommodative rates even with robust growth,\" wrote Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \"But it all depends how the data comes in, as we expect the rest of the FOMC will remain data-dependent and focused on the workhorse Fed models that Warsh has criticized.\"Warsh emerged from a competitive derby that one included 11 candidates, an array of past and present Fed officials, leading economists and a few Wall Street investment professionals including BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. That field was whittled down to five then four before Warsh emerged as the selection.Trump made no secret of the most important criteria — a willingness to slash rates lower and keep them low. The president has expressed the importance of lower rates as both a way to help the moribund U.S. housing market and to help lower financing costs for the $37 trillion U.S. debt. Before all that, he will have to be confirmed by a Senate during a ticklish political situation. The Trump Justice Department has been investigating the massive renovation project at the Fed's Washington, D.C., headquarters and has served Powell with a subpoena demanding information. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has vowed to block any Trump Fed nominees until that situation is resolved.Once that hurdle is cleared, Warsh would face a full Senate in which Republicans still command a majority.\"The Warsh pick is likely to have broad support – Democrat economist Jason Furman is out early in favor – and he should be relatively easy to confirm in the Senate,\" Guha said.

In keeping with the president's push for lower interest rates, Warsh is expected to be more supportive of cutting the Fed's key benchmark rate later this year. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" said Trump in a Truth Social post on Friday.

Longer-term rates, like mortgage rates, are more influenced by inflation and other economic factors.\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term,\" David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Kevin Warsh, Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\"It's too early to judge Kevin Warsh as Fed chair,\" said Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of \"Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future.\" \"What is clear from history, though, is that allowing inflation to persist at elevated levels for too long makes it much harder and far more painful to extinguish later,\" Higgins said.In the 1970s, then-President Richard Nixon, pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns to keep interest rates low — and give the economy some gas — in the run-up to the 1972 presidential election. That set the stage for runaway inflation, economists now say. Consumer prices surged in the decade that followed and the inflation rate peaked at around 15% in 1980, which remains the highest rate since the post-World War II period.The Fed ultimately, under new leadership, raised interest rates to punishing levels to rein in inflation, leading to surging borrowing costs in the '80s.\"The message to households is uncomfortable but important,\" Higgins said. \"Accepting shorter, more acute economic pain now is preferable to prolonged inflation that continues to erode purchasing power. History is unambiguous on this point.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a prolonged odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank.The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the selection.The pick of Warsh, 55, likely won't ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street's view that he wouldn't always do Trump's bidding.\"He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,\" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,\" added Bahnsen.Stock market futures nevertheless were slightly negative Friday morning, though off their lows since Warsh's appointment became clear.Warsh now faces Senate confirmation. If approved, he will take over the position in May, when Powell's term expires. Warsh will fill the Board of Governors position currently held by Governor Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday. Miran can continue to serve until a replacement is named. Read more CNBC news on Kevin WarshWho is Kevin Warsh?

Tillis will oppose Trump Fed chair pick Warsh until Powell probe resolvedTrump finally makes his Fed chair pick — what Kevin Warsh means for investorsHassett praises Trump's pick of Warsh to lead Fed, says he has his 'dream job' already'Regime change' coming?Since Powell's confirmation in 2018, during Trump's first term, the president has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, Trump kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed's massive renovation of its Washington, D.C., headquarters.Beyond interest rates, Warsh comes to the Fed at a time when policymakers have taken a looser hand on banking regulations. Among the changes, pushed by Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, herself once in the running for Fed chair, are lower capital requirements, reducing supervision and supervisory staff, and backing the Fed out of ancillary efforts like pushing banks to prepare for climate events.For his part, Warsh in a CNBC interview last summer called for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during the July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Trump's decision to nominate Warsh comes at one of the most precarious moments for the U.S. central bank in decades — with inflation not fully defeated, government borrowing escalating and the Fed itself facing unusually direct political pressure over how it conducts monetary policy.Most recently, the Justice Department subpoenaed Powell regarding the construction project. In an uncharacteristically blunt response, Powell charged the move was a \"pretext\" to push the Fed into following Trump's orders and ease policy further.To that end, the nomination comes as questions about Fed independence, a bedrock of central bank credibility, have moved from academic debate into concern. Trump and other administration officials have  floated ideas ranging from tighter White House oversight to changes in how the central bank sets rates, including forcing the chair to consult with the president on rate decisions.\"I want to keep it nice and pure, but he certainly wants to cut rates,\" Trump said Friday afternoon during an Oval Office session with reporters. He added that he has not talked with Warsh about cutting rates, though the president said that would be a litmus test for candidates.The nomination ends a competitive derby that at one point included 11 candidates. They spanned from former and current Fed officials to prominent economists and Wall Street pros in an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Ultimately, the field was winnowed to five then four, with Trump last week hinting to CNBC that he had arrived at his choice. Among the finalists were current Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.\"Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with 'TRUMP.' Such amazing talent in our Country,\" Trump said in a separate Truth Social post. Rieder, thought to be the favorite as recently as Thursday afternoon, congratulated Warsh on the nomination.\"This has been an incredible honor for me,\" Rieder said in a statement to CNBC. \"I congratulate Kevin on his nomination and think he will serve the institution and our nation very well.\"Trump praised Hassett and said he was so good at NEC that he didn't want to move him.\"He is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go,\" he said.In a CNBC interview, Hassett said he was not disappointed and wished Warsh well.\"I've got my dream job,\" he said. I think President Trump made a great choice, and I'm really thrilled and humbled by all the kind things he said about me. You know, the bottom line is that the economic team in this White House ... I think we've been hitting on all cylinders, and it's a really bad time to change teams.\"watch nowPolitical challengesFrom here, the nominee faces a tough road.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has indicated he will block any Fed nominees until the Justice Department probe is finished. \"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy. However, the Department of Justice continues to pursue a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell based on committee testimony that no reasonable person could construe as possessing criminal intent,\" Tillis posted Friday on social media site X.\"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved,\" he added.Hassett told CNBC that the DOJ issue \"could get resolved quickly. The White House is highly, highly confident that Kevin Warsh is a great nominee and that he should be confirmed as soon as possible, and every single resource we have at our disposal is behind him, and behind that outcome.\"The nomination gained support elsewhere in Congress. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who chairs the Senate banking committee, praised Warsh's \"deep knowledge of markets and monetary policy that will be essential in this role.\"\"The Federal Reserve's decisions touch every American household, from mortgage rates to retirement savings, and President Trump has been clear that bringing accountability and credibility to the Federal Reserve is a priority, and his nomination of Kevin Warsh reflects that focus,\" Scott said.The issues, though, are more than political.Though Trump has insisted that inflation has been vanquished, it remains a good deal from the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, the labor market has slowed, with the economy current in a no-fire, no-hire climate that poses another challenge to Fed policy.In any event, markets don't expect much action from the new chair: Traders are pricing in at most two more cuts this year before the benchmark fed funds rate lands around 3%, which policymakers have indicates is the long-run \"neutral\" rate that neither boosts nor hinders economic growth.Then there's the issue of what happens with Powell.Though chairs historically have resigned their Fed positions after being removed as chair, that may not be the case this time around. Powell has two years remaining in his governor term, and he could choose to serve it as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to compromise Fed independence. The Supreme Court already is weighing Trump's move to unseat Governor Lisa Cook, a case that ultimately could decide what powers a president has over Fed board members.",

    "body": "Movie posters for the documentary \"Melania\" featuring U.S. first lady Melania Trump are displayed in a New York City subway station, in New York, U.S., Jan. 14, 2026. Jeenah Moon | ReutersIt was a turbulent week for Amazon.From a bungled email prematurely announcing another massive round of layoffs to scrutiny around the company's $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady, Amazon heads into its quarterly earnings report next week surrounded by a deafening level of outside noise. On Saturday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and a top entertainment exec from the company joined a group of CEOs, politicians and celebrities at the White House for a private screening of \"Melania,\" which was produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Melania Trump. The event was roundly criticized for appearing tone deaf as it occurred mere hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed urgent care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second such deadly incident there in less than three weeks.  While most of the biggest names in tech stayed mum on the matter, many people in the industry expressed outrage over the incidents, and urged other members of the tech community to publicly denounce the killing of Pretti and the prior shooting of Renee Good, as well as President Donald Trump's immigration policies. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who attended the screening, subsequently issued a statement calling for a \"deescalation\" after the recent violence but without mentioning the two fatal shootings. Amazon hasn't commented on the matter. watch nowAmazon's ties to the Melania film, which officially hit theatres on Friday, was awkward enough given the political tensions building in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The price tag has raised further questions about Amazon's agenda and whether the company is trying to curry favor with the president. \"I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife,\" President Trump told reporters on Thursday at a premier for the movie in Washington, D.C.. \"I think it's a very important movie. I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal, actually.\"A spokesperson for Amazon MGM said in an email, \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\"Early ticket sales for the documentary have been weak, and the film is projected to bring in about $5 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, Puck News reported, citing National Research Group forecasting data.Tough timingMaking the timing even worse for Amazon, which has also agreed to stream a three-part docuseries through Prime Video, the company on Wednesday initiated another round of mass layoffs impacting about 16,000 corporate workers. The company let go of 14,000 employees last October.  The announcement was preempted a day early by an inadvertent email sent to cloud employees, which alluded to \"organizational changes,\" and a post from Amazon's human resources boss Beth Galetti. The layoffs are part of a broader effort by Jassy to cut costs and \"remove bureaucracy\" at the company, while it pushes to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Some employees previously told CNBC that the cost cuts and rolling layoffs have damaged morale. watch nowIn a Reddit forum for Amazon employees, some users questioned the rationale of the company's money-saving efforts alongside its investment in \"Melania.\" \"With $75 million we could have given each laid off employee about $4,500,\" wrote one user. \"But instead we spent it on the ridiculous Melania movie. Ashamed to work at Amazon.\" Analysts at Citizens said this week that they expect Amazon's 30,000 job cuts to generate up to $8 billion of cost savings in 2026. In a segment for \"The Daily Show\" that aired Thursday, host Desi Lydic called it a \"cash grab,\" and criticized Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO.  \"Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?,\" Lydic said. \"Hmm, let me think.\" And filmmaker Julie Cohen, who previously worked with Amazon on documentaries, told The New York Times that the Melania price tag was abnormal and suggests the company \"is buying something else for their money.\"After he was repeatedly attacked by Trump in his first term, Bezos has cozied up to the president this time around. He's dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, and he attended the inauguration a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and helped pay for Trump's $300 million ballroom renovation. There was even more drama in the broader Bezos universe this week after multiple outlets reported that the Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013, is preparing broad layoffs across the newsroom, with the sports, local and international sections expected to be impacted.The newspaper's White House team wrote a letter to Bezos, describing the importance of the work of those teams and telling their boss that they need \"collaboration with all corners of the newsroom.\"Earnings setupBy the middle of next week, the attention on Amazon will be coming from a more familiar place: Wall Street. On Thursday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results, wrapping up earnings season for the tech giants (though Nvidia reports later in the month). Amazon is expected to report revenue growth of about 13% to $211.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. The expansion is being driven by Amazon Web Services and digital advertising, which are both projected to show growth of around 22%, based on data from FactSet.  Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upped their price target on the stock this week and kept their buy recommendation, in part due to an acceleration at AWS, boosted by a recent deal with OpenAI. Amazon is now in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed this week.As Amazon races to keep pace with rivals in AI, the company is boosting spending on data centers. In the earnings report, capital expenditures are likely to show an increase of 24% from a year earlier to almost $34.5 billion, according to LSEG. The KeyBanc analysts said that while those rising costs will weigh on profitability, \"we believe Amazon will continue looking across the organization for further efficiencies to minimize the potential margin impact.\"WATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on the 'unprecedented' demand for AI computewatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe stock market is well-positioned to bounce next week if the heavyweight companies set to report earnings deliver strong numbers, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday. That's because the market ended the week on a subdued note, the \"Mad Money\" host said, after the S&P 500 finished in the red for three straight days.The busy week wastes no time getting underway, with Disney reporting on Monday and talk of CEO succession in the air. Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club, threw in the towel on its Disney position in November after a prolonged period of stagnant performance. \"There was always some division that held it back. I don't know which it is this time. You never do,\" Cramer said. On Tuesday, we'll get the latest from names including Pfizer, Pepsi, Merck, Advanced Micro Devices, and Chipotle. While investors will look to AMD for insights into the AI boom, Cramer said it's possible that even a terrific set of numbers will be met with selling. That's seemingly become \"the new pattern\" for chip stocks, he said. Also Tuesday, Western Digital is hosting what it's dubbed an innovation day, where the company plans to highlight innovations aimed at supporting growing data storage demand. Cramer said the upcoming event is \"critical\" after the company's stock got crushed Friday despite posting a great quarter the prior evening. \"We have to find out what that's about,\" he said.Eli Lilly reports Wednesday morning, and Cramer said he'll be watching for whether the obesity drugmaker shares any new trial results for its GLP-1 portfolio — something that could be more meaningful to the stock's movements than the quarterly results themselves. Lilly shares are down about 3.5% year to date. Alphabet, which reports Wednesday night, will be among the most consequential reports for the market. \"This is a company that many wrote off as the least of the 'Magnificent Seven,'\" Cramer said, but the narrative has completely flipped. \"Whether it be Gemini, the best of the chatbots, or YouTube, the most popular video site in the world, or Waymo ... or Google itself, doesn't matter. Alphabet is the best and when it reports, I think it could romp.\" The other tech giant reporting next week is Amazon, which will release its numbers after the close Thursday. Cramer said Amazon has become a controversial stock. When the stock finally gets momentum, Cramer said the sellers appear, eroding the gains. \"Lost in the shuffle is the greatness of the company itself,\" Cramer said, acknowledging the stock's lackluster returns of late. \"I'm a believer.\" Rounding out the week on Friday is the January employment report, which Cramer said could come in weaker than anticipated both on job gains and wage inflation. That could help support lower bond yields while enabling stocks to soar, he said. \"I think it's a distinct possibility.\" Disclosure: Cramer's Charitable Trust has positions in LLY, AMZN and GOOGL.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.watch now",

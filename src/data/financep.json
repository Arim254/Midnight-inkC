    "body": "One kilogram and a five hundred gram gold bars next to one kilogram silver bars at The Vaults Group gold dealers arranged in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, April 28, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold and silver prices lost ground on Wednesday as investors booked profits after a historic annual rally and exchange operator CME Group hiked the margins on precious metal futures for the second time in the space of a week.Spot gold prices dipped 0.1% to $4,339.89 per ounce at 8:50 a.m. ET, extending losses in the run-up to the new year. The yellow metal notched a one-week low in the previous session.Spot silver prices, meanwhile, tumbled 5.6% to $72.15 per ounce, paring gains after climbing above $80 for the first time at the start of the week.The moves come at the end of a blockbuster year for the precious metals.Gold is up more than 64% year to date, on track for its best annual performance since 1979 and third straight positive year. The rally has been supported by a multitude of factors, including the impact of U.S. interest rate cuts, tariff tensions, and robust demand from exchange-traded funds and central banks.  Silver has far outpaced gold in 2025. The metal, which has endured wild price swings in recent days, is on course for annual gains of nearly 150%. Like gold, this would be silver's best yearly performance since 1979. Silver's price boom has stemmed from a mix of low supply and high demand from India, as well as industrial needs and tariffs.watch nowCME Group, one of the world's largest trading floors for commodities, said Tuesday that margins for gold, silver, platinum and palladium would increase again after the close of business Wednesday. It said in a statement that the decision was made \"as per the normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage.\"  The notice means traders will need to put up more cash on their bets to insure against the prospect of a default when they take delivery of the contract.CME Group raised margin requirements for precious metals earlier in the week, prompting gold and silver futures to fall sharply on Monday.— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.",

    "body": "As the restaurant industry endured another difficult year, many chains opted to close underperforming locations as they try to turn around their businesses.Inflation-weary consumers have pulled back their restaurant spending, choosing to eat at home or chasing deals when they go out for a meal. While some restaurants have won over reluctant diners, the industry has largely struggled with the sales slump. Traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month in 2025, excluding only July, according to Black Box Intelligence. In years past, restaurant closures have been more concentrated across casual-dining chains, which lost customers to fast-casual competitors like Chipotle. But this year, chains across the industry announced plans to shutter at least hundreds of locations.In such a tough environment, some restaurant companies even filed for bankruptcy protection. Hooters, Pinstripes and On the Border were some of the notable names that landed in bankruptcy court this year.Here are the chains that announced closures in 2025:StarbucksA Starbucks coffee cup sits on a table inside a Starbucks in New York on Dec. 2, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn September, the coffee giant announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that included closing roughly 500 of its North American locations. The closures even extended to shuttering its upscale Reserve Roastery cafe in Seattle, the company's hometown.Starbucks' announcement followed CEO Brian Niccol's one-year anniversary at the helm of the company. Under his leadership, Starbucks is trying to reverse a sales slump in the U.S., its biggest market. Executives plan to share more details about the turnaround at the company's upcoming investor day in late January in New York. Wendy'sA Wendy's restaurant sign in Austin, Texas, Nov. 10, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn November, Wendy's announced that it would undergo a strategic review of its restaurant footprint and begin closing underperforming locations that quarter. While the company did not announce a specific number of closures, interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook told analysts that the company could shutter a \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its U.S. restaurants shuttering, which would mean hundreds of the burger chain's locations.The closures are one phase of Wendy's \"Project Fresh\" turnaround plan. The company has reported same-store sales declines even as rivals McDonald's and Burger King see higher demand for their Big Macs and Whoppers.In 2024, Wendy's shuttered about 140 locations.Denny'sA view of a Denny's restaurant in Hayward, California, Feb. 14, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn February, Denny's said it planned to close between 70 and 90 restaurants in 2025. In recent months, the diner chain's sales sunk as customers opted to visit cheaper fast-food restaurants for breakfast. The shift in behavior led the company to shutter underperforming locations and attempt to improve the rest of its restaurant footprint.In November, the chain announced it had sold itself for $620 million to Yadav Enterprises, TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Treville Capital Group. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.Jack in the BoxGeri Lavrov | Getty ImagesIn April, Jack in the Box said it would close between 150 and 200 restaurants as part of its \"Jack on Track\" strategy to improve its financial performance. By the end of its fiscal 2025 on Sept. 28, the chain had permanently shuttered 86 restaurants. Bahama BreezeIn May, Bahama Breeze parent company Darden Restaurants closed 15 of the chain's locations, which represents roughly a third of its overall footprint. Following the closures, executives decided that the Caribbean-inspired chain was not a strategic priority for Darden, so the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the brand. Options include selling the chain outright or converting its restaurants into other Darden brands, like Olive Garden. Darden expects to make a decision on Bahama Breeze by the end of its fiscal 2026, which concludes in May.Hardee'sDozens of Hardee's locations will close by end of the year after the franchisor sued ARC Burger, one of its largest franchisees. Hardee's alleges that the operator fell behind on payments like royalties, rent and taxes. ARC, which is owned by private equity firm High Bluff Capital Partners, operated 77 Hardee's restaurants before the legal battle began. Its footprint stretched across eight states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Wyoming, according to legal filings.Papa John'sThe Papa John's Pizza logo is shown in Austin, Texas, May 9, 2024.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesIn the first three quarters of 2025, Papa John's shuttered 173 restaurants worldwide, according to company filings. Most of the closures affected international locations, although 62 of the pizza chain's U.S. locations also closed.Despite the closures, Papa John's still had nearly 6,000 restaurants in operation at the end of September.Noodles & Co.Michael Siluk | UCG | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAt the end of October, Noodles & Co. had closed 29 company-owned restaurants this year, and executives said that they planned to shutter another two to five underperforming locations by the end of 2025. In 2024, the fast-casual chain closed 20 locations.By the end of 2026, Noodles & Co. is planning to close another 12 to 17 stores, as it aims to improve the company's financial performance and boost sales at the chain's nearby locations.Outback SteakhouseAn Outback Steakhouse restaurant in Daly City, California, Jan. 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn October, restaurant company Bloomin' Brands closed 21 locations across the company. The closures hit Outback Steakhouse, the gem of its portfolio, as well as Bonefish Grill and Carrabba's Italian Grill.Bloomin' has identified nearly two dozen other restaurants that will not renew their leases when they expire over the next four years, executives said in November when sharing the company's quarterly earnings. At the same time, the company announced a $75 million turnaround plan to improve Bloomin' sales and its overall financial health.",

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai waves as he arrives at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, Feb. 11, 2025.Benoit Tessier | ReutersAfter a tough start to the year, Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street's perspective — since 2009, when the company's shares doubled coming out of the financial crisis. Alphabet's stock popped 65% for the year, slightly ahead of its gains in 2021. The shares hit their 2025 low in April, as President Donald Trump was threatening massive tariffs on trading partners, but they've since jumped over 100%. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer. The next sharpest rallies came from chipmakers Broadcom and Nvidia, which gained 49% and 39%, respectively. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet vs. the Nasdaq in 2025Getting to this point required Google to stare down the skeptics, who questioned whether the search giant could maintain its dominance in the artificial intelligence era. With OpenAI's ChatGPT and Sora services capturing an increasing amount of consumer engagement and concerns swirling around the future of online advertising in a world of AI chatbots and agents, Google's business model was viewed as a target for major disruption. Alphabet's 18% plunge in the first quarter was its worst period for the stock since mid-2022. But the mood started to improve in the second quarter. In April, the company promoted 16-year company veteran Josh Woodward to run the Gemini app, Google's answer to ChatGPT. In August, Woodward's group debuted image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that lets users turn to AI to generate images. The feature went viral at launch when people used it to blend multiple photos together to create personal digitized figurines. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI's ChatGPT at the top of Apple's App Store. Google's AI talent pool deepened over the summer, when the company announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior research and development employees from the high-profile startup that had previously been in talks with OpenAI for a $3 billion acquisition. That deal fell apart, and Google ended up agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and for compensation to snag Windsurf's top engineers. Winning in AI and in courtSoon thereafter, Google was handed a gift in the courtroom.Despite losing its antitrust case last year, as Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in September against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Justice Department. Google would not have to divest Chrome and could still make payments to companies to preload products, meaning it could continue paying Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on iPhones. One consequence of the ruling is that Google would have to share certain data with competitors. Gemini's momentum has been the biggest story.Last month, Google announced Gemini 3, an upgraded AI model, almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall usage, it's been rapidly making up ground. According to data this month from Similarweb, ChatGPT's share of generative AI traffic dropped to about 68% from 87% a year earlier, while Gemini jumped to roughly 18% from about 5% over that stretch. watch nowAnalysts at Citizens wrote in a Tuesday report that the critical development for Alphabet isn't just about Gemini but the effect of the company's AI investments on the core search business. AI Overviews is Google's search-embedded service that provides AI-powered summaries for user queries. The Citizens analysts said the \"incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers, which we view as a further tailwind to engagement.\"\"We come away believing Google can further accelerate search revenue in 4Q25, which we view as the key question near term,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the shares even after the latest rally. Analysts have also highlighted Google's broad strength in cloud computing, where it's chasing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and the company's leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as potential catalysts heading into 2026. Still, with investors piling into the stock, expectations are sky-high. Analysts project fourth-quarter revenue growth of 15% to over $111 billion when Alphabet next reports results, according to LSEG, and growth throughout next year is expected to be in the low teens.In October, Alphabet raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as high as $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts see that number jumping to more than $114 billion in 2026, according to FactSet. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. He said on the October earnings call that Google's cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter than in the two prior years combined. Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a note to clients earlier this month that should OpenAI, one of Google's key customers, cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations, \"it is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general.\"But the Pivotal analysts have a buy rating on the stock and raised their price target by $50, to $400, about 28% above Wednesday's closing price of $313.\"We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way,\" they wrote. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "A new year is the perfect time to reflect on your financial habits and make small changes that can have a big impact. For over a decade, I've worked with clients navigating life transitions, like divorce and retirement, to help them forge their new financial paths. In my experience, there are six money personalities that represent the ways that people's money beliefs and attitudes play out in daily life. Here's my best money advice for each personality going into 2026: 1. The GiverThe Giver has a heart of gold and a generous spirit. Whether helping a friend in need, contributing to a worthy cause, or lending a hand to a stranger down on their luck, the Giver is always there. But this can lead to overspending, neglected personal financial needs, and even feelings of resentment.My best money advice for 2026For the Giver, the key is finding balance. With thoughtful planning and increased awareness of when to say no, you can continue to support others without jeopardizing your financial situation. When you find yourself in a pinch, remember that there are many ways to fill others' cups — as well as your own — that don't cost a dime. In fact, often your time and talents can make an even greater impact than your treasures.2. The TrailblazerTrailblazers don't follow the herd — they lead it. They exude confidence and embrace thoughtful risks. They are driven, focused, and relentless in their pursuit of success. But here's the twist: Their fierce independence can lead to burnout and a reluctance to ask for help.My best money advice for 2026While a Trailblazer may excel at creating wealth, managing it requires a much different skill set. It's important to learn how to delegate. By recognizing your limitations and leveraging the expertise of others, you can maximize the potential of your hard-earned money. This will ultimately reduce stress and enhance your overall financial success — allowing you to enjoy the fruits of your labor.3. The SkepticMoney? Nah, that's for the fat cats and money-grubbers. The Skeptic's mistrust can stunt their financial progress. They often feel caught between believing they don't deserve wealth and panicking at the thought of pursuing it. The result? They continue to repeat behaviors that leave them feeling financially insecure.My best money advice for 2026Writing down all your positive qualities can help you see that your worth isn't tied to your bank account. Surround yourself with people who are financially successful — as well as kind and generous — to help reshape your views on money. Witnessing how wealth can be used for good might help dismantle the assumption that it inherently breeds greed.4. The High RollerHigh Rollers live for the moment! Fancy things light them up. Saving for the future? Not so much. Their emotions can lead to impulsive purchases, and they can easily lose track of spending — which may result in a pile of debt. This constant pursuit of pleasure can cause the High Roller to feel empty inside. My best money advice for 2026Exploring how you cope with emotions, like boredom or anxiety, can help reduce impulse purchases. Budgeting apps or spending trackers, along with thoughtful discussions about the relationship between self-worth and material things, can help build self-awareness around spending habits. Transitioning to a cash-only system can also be a powerful tool for you — limiting your ability to rely on credit cards when you're tempted to splurge.5. The Penny PincherThe Penny Pincher is a perpetual saver, regardless of how much they have in the bank. They are disciplined and resourceful when it comes to spending (which is a good thing!) and often feel guilty after making a purchase — even when it's a necessity. Typically, they are debt- and risk-averse and fear losing it all, which can cause them to miss out on opportunities to effectively grow their wealth or benefit from valuable experiences.My best money advice for 2026Learning the basics of investing can empower the Penny Pincher to take calculated risks. Setting specific spending goals — like taking a dream vacation or planning fun nights out with friends — can help you shift your focus from what you might lose to what your money can help you gain and experience. This approach can build confidence and create a more balanced perspective.6. The AvoiderThe Avoider would rather not think about money, let alone talk about it. They typically have no idea where they stand financially. And frankly, most don't know where to start. But the more they avoid their situation, the more anxious they become.My best money advice for 2026Even the smallest actions can spark change. Dedicating just 10 minutes each week to reviewing your account balances, exploring your spending, or asking for help can empower you to confront your financial situation with less stress. Additionally, seeking resources like online articles, podcasts, or financial literacy classes can help you take actionable steps to improve your financial well-being.Keep in mindThese aren't meant to be reductive labels but rather lenses that build awareness of your current habits. Remember:These aren't rigid categories. Your behavior with money can change over time as life experiences shape new financial habits.Growth is always possible. Recognizing your tendencies empowers you to make intentional shifts and cultivate healthier behaviors.Identifying with multiple types is typical. It's common to exhibit traits from more than one personality type.And of course, you may want to seek personalized financial advice that's tailored to your specific needs.Steph Wagner is a nationally recognized thought leader in women's wealth and financial empowerment who serves as the National Director of Women & Wealth at Northern Trust.

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

    "body": "Toward the end of the year, many of us commit to ambitious, concrete goals like cutting your screen time in half or running three miles every morning.That approach often backfires, according to neuroscientist Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD.Linear goals like these are popular because they give people \"the illusion of certainty,\" according to Le Cunff, author of \"Tiny Experiments: How to Live Freely in a Goal-Obsessed World.\"\"They make us feel like we're in control, because we think that if we have a clear vision and a clear plan, and we execute on that plan, then we're going to be successful,\" she tells CNBC Make It.But real life rarely adheres to our best-laid plans, which is why so many people end up repeating their New Year's resolutions \"over and over again every year\" without making progress, she says.Instead, she recommends approaching your goals with an \"experimental mindset.\" Just like scientists collect data and use the results to inform their next choices, \"you can do the exact same thing with your career and your life in general.\"If you're hoping to start a new routine this year, Le Cunff recommends conducting \"tiny experiments\" with the habits you'd like to try, instead of setting lofty, unrealistic goals.How to create a 'tiny experiment' Tiny experiments follow a very simple formula, according to Le Cunff: \"I will [do X action] for [Y duration].\"Some examples could be \"I will write 250 words every day for two weeks,\" or, \"I will take a walk on my lunch break every day for one month.\"One of Le Cunff's favorites is, \"I will not bring my phone into my bedroom for one week.\" A good tiny experiment meets four criteria, according to Le Cunff: It must be \"purposeful, actionable, continuous and trackable.\" To be purposeful, the experiment has to involve something you are \"deeply curious about,\" Le Cunff says, and an actionable experiment is one that you can conduct \"right now with your current resources.\"It's crucial to run the experiment continuously in order to collect enough data, she explains, and tracking your consistency will help you determine how well the experiment is working for you.The key is to \"withhold judgment until you're done conducting your experiment,\" Le Cunff says. Trying something new can be uncomfortable, but that's part of the process.After the experiment is over, you can decide whether or not you would like to incorporate that action into your daily life. \"You can actually use experiments as a gateway to discover new habits that work for you,\" Le Cunff says.Why this approach worksMany of us have a tendency \"to always want to go for the bigger, more impressive, more ambitious version of a goal,\" Le Cunff says, but that mentality has several pitfalls. For one, long-ranging goals like \"I will work out every day this year\" or \"I will read one book a week\" are often \"too overwhelming or unrealistic.\"Announcing your impressive goal to other people gives your brain a \"big dopamine hit,\" Le Cunff says, but that can paradoxically reduce your motivation to achieve it. After all, \"we already got the reward of people telling us, 'Oh wow, you're so strong, you're so ambitious.'\"By contrast, telling others 'I'm going to jog twice a week for one month' may sound less impressive than 'I'm going to run every day for the next year,' but \"then you actually get the very healthy dopamine at the end from actually having done the thing,\" Le Cunff says.Tiny experiments help shift people from an outcome-based mindset to a curious, explorative one. With this perspective, \"success is not reaching a particular milestone that you have defined in advance. Success is learning something new,\" she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Throughout his career, the business and investing icon routinely shared wisdom to help others build successful lives, from  singing the praises of compound interest to offering a thought exercise for living without regrets.At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett gave advice to those at the opposite end of their career as him: \"Don't worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,\" he told the audience in response to a question about lessons he learned early on. \"There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.\"Though it may be tempting for workers just starting out to accept whichever job offers the most competitive salary they can find, Buffett emphasized that other factors may be more important over the course of your career.'Find people that are wonderful to work with'While a good starting salary can help set you up for financial success, your coworkers and managers may play an outsized role in your long-term career success, Buffett said.\"Who you associate with is enormously important,\" he said. \"Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.\"He drew on his own experience of finding mentors who bestowed their wisdom upon him as a young person learning the ins and outs of running a business, and encouraged young people to find people in their own lives who have careers they admire and go work with them.\"I've had five bosses in life and I liked every one of them — they were all interesting. I still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else,\" Buffett said. \"But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go.\"Don't do it for the moneyIn addition to surrounding yourself with smart and interesting people, Buffett said it's wise to look for a job you would do even if you didn't need the money. \"I've had that for a very long time,\" he added.Not only has the 95-year-old made a lot of money throughout his career, but he has often shared how much he's enjoyed his work and colleagues. \"I get to do what I like to do with people that I love,\" Buffett said in a 2008 interview. He encouraged young people to find a similarly meaningful career.\"It's interesting to me that in the investment business, so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money,\" he said at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2025. \"You really want something that you'll stick around for whether you need the money or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term Tuesday, blocking bills that would support a pair of bipartisan infrastructure projects in Colorado and Florida. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, which Congress unanimously approved earlier in December, enraged the state's lawmakers. The bill would reduce the payments local communities must provide to the federal government for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline poised to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. In a message to Congress after vetoing the legislation, Trump said the bill would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"\"Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" he said. Bipartisan Colorado lawmakers who pushed the bill erupted after the veto, vowing Congress will override it. Some argued that Trump is making good on his vow for retribution after Colorado refused to free Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted last year of crimes relating to the breach of voting machines after the 2020 election.Trump warned earlier this year in a Truth Social post that if she was not released, he would \"take harsh measures!!!\" Trump issued a pardon for Peters in December, but it was largely symbolic since Peters was convicted in a state court.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"This isn't governing.

On Wednesday, however, he issued a Truth Social post saying, \"God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison.\"\"Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting 'Republican' (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,\" the President wrote.Congress' unanimous passage of the bill suggests it will have the votes to override Trump's veto if GOP leadership in both chambers allows it. Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate would be needed to override the veto.Rep. Jeff Hurd, another Colorado Republican, said in a post to X that he will \"continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.\" CNBC has reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson's office to ask if he will allow the chamber to override the veto. The Florida bill Trump vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, also passed Congress by voice vote. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include an area known as the Osecola Camp, part of the Everglades National Park. Trump in a message to Congress said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"In Trump's first term, he vetoed a total of 10 bills. His first veto came in 2019, two years into his term, to overturn a congressional move to end a national emergency at the southern border. Congress failed to override that veto.",

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs.

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBC The investing world's north star is beginning to dim.Warren Buffett has handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel after a six-decade run that turned an unremarkable textile company into one of the most powerful compounding engines in market history, leaving investors grappling with how singular that achievement really was, even as he remains chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.When Buffett took control of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, its shares traded around $19. By the end of 2025, a single Class A share was worth over $750,000. From 1964 — the year before Buffett took control of Berkshire — to 2024, the one-of-a-kind conglomerate delivered a compounded annual gain of 19.9%, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%, resulting in an overall return of more than 5.5 million percent, according to the company's latest annual report. The shares added another 10% to that return in 2025.The record was built on an unusually spare formula: use insurance float as a source of low-cost capital, buy businesses with durable cash flows and allow time to do most of the work. That approach produced long-held stakes in companies such as Coca-Cola and American Express, while Berkshire expanded into railroads, utilities and manufacturing through wholly owned subsidiaries.\"If it was that easy to do again, somebody would be doing it,\" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder, said. \"You think about the duo that having Charlie Munger as your partner, it's just hard to imagine that coming together again anytime soon.\"As Buffett relinquishes the helm, investors are increasingly focused on what disappears with him. Seth Klarman, founder of the Baupost Group, called Buffett \"an American role model\" and said his retirement represents more than a leadership transition. \"The world of investing will be different without Warren Buffett at the helm of Berkshire,\" Klarman said in a tribute.'Going Quiet'Buffett has said he's \"going quiet\" as he steps back, signaling a reduced public presence even as he remains chairman. Abel will assume responsibility for Berkshire's annual shareholder letters, a tradition Buffett began in 1965 that became essential reading on Wall Street for its plainspoken lessons on markets, management and capital allocation. Buffett will keep penning a Thanksgiving message, however.The annual letters were one pillar of Buffett's influence. The other was Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. Often dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" the gathering drew tens of thousands of investors to Omaha, Nebraska, each year for hours of unscripted Q&A. The event cemented Buffett's role not just as a steward of capital, but as a steady public voice investors trusted to put market upheaval into perspective.watch nowBuffett also rejected many Wall Street conventions. Berkshire never split its stock, discouraging speculation and cultivating a shareholder base oriented toward decades rather than quarters. The company declined to issue earnings guidance and gave operating managers wide autonomy, while capital allocation decisions remained centralized in Omaha.\"Warren, as chairman, will be an advisor to Greg, a cultural anchor, and a real long term thinker,\" said Ann Winblad, managing director at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and longtime Berkshire shareholder, on CNBC's \"The Exchange.\" \"Will the company fundamentally change in its strategies? No. ..The culture of Berkshire Hathaway, which is what I've invested in, which is patient, long term, careful and decisive investing, will probably still remain.\"The company held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring both its financial firepower and Buffett's caution in a richly valued market. Berkshire has also been a net seller of equities for 12 straight quarters, a rare and sustained retreat that reflects limited opportunities at its scale.Shareholder attention is shifting to a less settled part of the succession plan: the fate of its $300 billion equity portfolio. With no obvious successor possessing a comparable record in public equities, some analysts say Berkshire may ultimately scale back active stock selection, particularly given the size and concentration of the portfolio.Buffett has also repeatedly cautioned shareholders against mistaking volatility for failure. \"Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management,\" he wrote. \"Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.\"",

    "body": "©Studio One-one | Moment Unreleased | Getty ImagesDepending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, \"the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,\" the notice reads.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

Saturday, June 14, 2025.Jerry Holt | Star Tribune via APCongressional Republicans on Wednesday called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to testify amid an ongoing social services fraud scandal, as the White House signaled it could expand its investigations into other blue states.A day after the Trump administration said it would freeze hundreds of millions of dollars of child-care funds to Minnesota, House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer, R-Ky., invited Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, to appear before the panel on Feb. 10. \"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said in a Wednesday statement.An earlier hearing, slated for Jan. 7, will feature Minnesota state officials who sounded the alarm or investigated the fraud.\"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money,\" he continued.Walz, who took office in 2019, has come under fire in recent months over fraud scams that occurred during his administration. He has recently faced calls to resign.

These states will all be under investigation and consideration as far as this administration is concerned,\" Leavitt said.\"Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia,\" Trump said Wednesday in a Truth Social post in which he also attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Somali American to serve in Congress. Trump called Omar \"an ungrateful loser.\"Omar could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.\"Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country's greatness. Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth,\" Trump said. He also called Walz a \"crooked governor.\"A spokesperson for Walz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, responded on Wednesday: \"We're always happy to work with Congress, though this committee has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand.\" \"While the Governor has been working to ensure fraudsters go to prison, the President has been selling pardons to let them out,\" the statement continued.In a Wednesday press release, Ellison defended his record, claiming he has \"prosecuted over 300 Medicaid fraud cases and won over $80 million in recoveries and restitution for the people of Minnesota,\" since taking office in 2019.Ellison also said he and his team were \"exploring all legal options\" in response to the halted child-care funds.\"This hasty, scorched earth-attack is not just wrong, it may well be illegal,\" Ellison said.The freezing of child-care money, as well as FBI Director Kash Patel's Sunday announcement of a surge of federal agents to Minnesota, followed a viral video posted over the weekend by a conservative influencer that purported to show nonoperational child-care facilities that received federal funds. The video brought renewed attention to long-simmering allegations of fraud that have raised questions about Walz's leadership and led to the targeting of Minnesota's large Somali community for its alleged role in various schemes.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill and Assistant Secretary Alex Adams announced the funding freeze in a post Tuesday on X. O'Neill also announced a nationwide verification system to authorize child-care payments, demanded that Walz investigate individuals suspected of fraud and announced a fraud-reporting hotline.\"We believe the state of Minnesota has allowed scammers and fake daycares to siphon millions of taxpayer dollars over the past decade,\" O'Neill said.\"Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,\" O'Neill wrote in a subsequent post.Vice President JD Vance applauded the move.\"Turning off payments and forcing verification before taxpayer money flows out the door is one of the most important steps we can take to end the fraud in Minnesota. But there will be many more to come,\" Vance said Tuesday on X. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday posted that 98 individuals had been charged and more than 60 had been found guilty in court. Of those charged, 85 are of Somali descent, according to Bondi.\"We have more prosecutions coming…BUCKLE UP, LAWMAKERS!\" Bondi said on X.Investigations into Minnesota's social services program date back several years. A federal prosecutor in Minnesota said earlier this month that more than a dozen Medicaid-funded programs were being probed and that as much as half of the $18 billion in taxpayer funds spent on those programs since 2018 may have been stolen.One Covid-era scam, which hinged on a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, led to charges for dozens of defendants who allegedly stole $250 million in taxpayer funds.Walz has come under fire for allowing the fraud to transpire on his watch. This weekend, a group of Minnesota Republicans called on Walz to resign, citing the state's \"fraud crisis.\"House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has also called on Walz to step down. In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday, Emmer praised the Trump administration's actions and took aim at his state's governor.\"Tim Walz's incompetence and inaction has hurt every Minnesotan, and now Walz is suffering the consequences,\" Emmer said. \"His failed leadership has allowed billions to be stolen from hardworking Minnesota taxpayers.\"",

    "body": "The housing market has spent the past few years stuck with high prices and slow sales. But in 2026, conditions are expected to ease slightly for buyers, a shift Redfin describes as a \"reset\" year.That reset is being driven by a growing supply of homes after years of limited inventory, which may push prices down in some markets next year. Overall, home prices have mostly leveled off over the past two years, as new construction has picked up. And there are already signs the market is loosening: Homes are sitting on the market longer, negotiations are becoming more common, and builders are offering discounts in markets where the supply of newly constructed homes has increased, according to Realtor.com.That doesn't mean homes will suddenly become affordable nationwide. Median home prices are still too high for many buyers after rising by 25% since 2020, according to U.S. Census data. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates are also expected to remain elevated above 6% in 2026, limiting how much relief buyers are likely to see.In some markets, though, builders are increasingly using price cuts and incentives to move inventory, giving buyers more leverage, even though affordability remains tight overall.\"The bottom line for 2026 is that it will be a transitional year,\" Chris Reis, a broker with Compass in Seattle, tells CNBC Make It. \"There won't be a crash or a boom, just the market finding its footing after years of extraordinary disruption. Buyers will have more selection and negotiating power than at any time since the pandemic.\"What to expect in 2026Most housing forecasts point to a market that looks more stable than dramatic: Home prices are expected to rise slowly, and mortgage rates might dip modestly, although borrowing costs will still make buying expensive for many households. Here's how several major forecasters expect U.S. home prices to change in 2026:Redfin: +1.0%Realtor.com: +2.2%Zillow: +1.2%Fannie Mae: +1.3%Meanwhile, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% in 2026, where they've been for the past three years. The current average rate is about 6.2%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Here's where major forecasters expect rates to land next year:Redfin: 6.3%Realtor.com: 6.3%Fannie Mae: 5.9%Mortgage Bankers Association: Low-to-mid 6% range While there may not be a lot of cost relief in home prices or mortgage rates, buyers are seeing more negotiating room where housing supply has increased — particularly in new construction.That's because builders sitting on recently completed homes are more willing to make deals, says Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.\"Quick move-in inventory is readily available, and builders are cutting prices and offering incentives to get it sold,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. That flexibility is less common in the current housing market, where many homeowners remain locked into lower mortgage rates and have little incentive to sell.Where prices could decline in 2026Home-price trends in 2026 are expected to vary widely by metropolitan area.While prices will keep rising modestly in many parts of the country, some large housing markets are expected to see flat or declining prices, particularly across parts of the West and South, per Realtor.com. In those areas, buyers may find more room to negotiate.Based on Realtor.com's 2026 forecast, these are 10 of the 100 largest U.S. metros expected to see the biggest year-over-year home-price declines next year:Cape Coral–Fort Myers, Florida: −10.2% North Port–Sarasota–Bradenton, Florida: −8.9% Stockton–Lodi, California: −4.1% Raleigh, North Carolina: −3.7% Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, Florida: −3.6% Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, Florida: −3.6% Spokane–Spokane Valley, Washington: −3.5% Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, Colorado: −3.4% Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, California: −3.3% San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward, California: −2.5%Realtor.com's projections estimate 2026 home-price changes by factoring in inventory, mortgage-rate expectations, and local economic conditions.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

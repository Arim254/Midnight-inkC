    "body": "Eli Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies — including both Lilly and Novo — from the levies for three years. Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs. ",

    "body": "American Express announces the new platinum business card.Courtesy: American ExpressAmerican Express is finding that even for a provider of credit cards to the affluent, it pays to focus on the highest of high rollers.The company recently shifted marketing dollars to its refreshed Platinum card, which carries an $895 annual fee, and away from no-fee cash back cards, CEO Stephen Squeri told analysts Friday after the company reported fourth-quarter results.Doing that helps to boost overall spending levels as high-end consumers continue to thrive, a tactic that leads to both rising fee revenue from premium cards and lower loan defaults, executives said.\"We have the ability … to be really flexible with our marketing investments, and we saw a tremendous demand for premium products, particularly the Platinum card,\" Squeri said.\"The overall portfolio is slowly getting more premium [as] the Platinum portfolio is growing at a very fast pace,\" he added.AmEx's strategy shift is the latest example of the so-called \"K-shaped\" U.S. economy playing out, in which wealthy consumers continue to spend freely while others rein in their expenses. Data from the card company shows that demand for high-end products and luxury experiences is accelerating, while purchases in more basic categories rises at a slower pace.Spending at luxury retailers surged 15% in the quarter, business and first-class airfare purchases rose 9%, and luxury hotel spending was up 12%, CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC in an interview.Meanwhile, spending at airlines and lodging more generally was up 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter, showing that the richest cardmembers are driving results.Card growth slowingThe commentary helped allay fears from analysts that the relaunch of the pricey Platinum card last fall hadn't gone well.AmEx said Friday that new card accounts hit 2.9 million at year-end, a decline from the third quarter and the lowest figure in the past five quarters, as the company focused on its more profitable card products. \"We are incrementally worried that the Platinum Card refresh isn't generating much traction,\" said BTIG analysts led by Vincent Caintic, citing new competition from other card issuers and consumer weariness over high fees and cumbersome perks.While the company doesn't disclose its total number of cardmembers, including for the Platinum card, Squeri told analysts Friday that \"all of the metrics that we look at speaks to the fact that this was a wildly successful product launch.\"Still, shares of AmEx were down about 3.5% in midday trading after the company's results and guidance disappointed some. Earnings per share of $3.53 were a penny below the consensus estimate, according to LSEG. That was due in part to higher-than-expected expenses, at $14.5 billion, driven by the costs of the Platinum refresh, the company said.\"If there is a rub, perhaps it is that 4Q clearly shows the cost of the Platinum refresh, but doesn't show a corresponding bump on new accounts,\" wrote Truist analyst Brian Foran in a research note.",

Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

    "body": "watch nowChevron on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates as record oil production offset the pinch of lower crude prices. Last year, oil logged its biggest annual price decline since 2020. Chevron could be poised to grow its production even further this year in the wake of a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela that removed President Nicolás Maduro and effectively seized control of the South American nation's oil industry. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. It said Friday it can ramp up production in Venezuela by 50% over the next 18 to 24 months. \"We have been a part of Venezuela's past for more than a century. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a ⁠better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security,\" CEO Mike Wirth said in a news release.Chevron shares rose more than 3%. Here is what Chevron reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.52 adjusted vs. $1.45 expectedRevenue: $46.87 billion vs. $47.1 billionChevron reported net income that fell more than 14% compared with the year-ago period due to low oil prices. It booked earnings of $2.77 billion for the quarter, or $1.39 per share, compared with earnings of $3.24 billion, or $1.84 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. After adjustments, Chevron earned $1.52 per share, outpacing the Street's consensus estimate of $1.45 per share. Revenue came in at $46.87 billion, a decline of 10% from $52.23 billion in the year-ago period.More barrels from Venezuela would add to Chevron's already strong output in the U.S. and around the world. It increased production in 2025 by 12% worldwide and 16% in the U.S. to record levels. For the quarter, Chevron pumped 4.05 million barrels per day, an increase of about 21% compared with 3.35 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Wall Street views Chevron as the U.S. oil company best positioned to benefit from the U.S. intervention in Venezuela. Competitors such as Exxon Mobil are hesitant to return to Venezuela due to the country's history of seizing the assets of international oil majors. Chevron's U.S. production business booked profit of $1.26 billion, down about 11% compared with $1.42 billion in the year-ago period. International production posted a profit of $1.78 billion, down 38% from earnings of $2.88 billion in the the fourth quarter of 2024.Its U.S. refining business swung to a profit of $230 million after posting a loss of $348 million in the year-ago period. International refining posted earnings of $593 million, an increase of nearly 500% from $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.The company said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 4% to $1.78 per share.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Ford Motor said it will report pretax charges of $600 million in its fourth-quarter results due to adjustments in its employee pension plans and other postretirement benefits.The Detroit automaker said the special charges, which will affect its net income but not its adjusted results or cash, are split between domestic plans and those outside the U.S.\"The remeasurement loss for U.S. plans was largely driven by actuarial losses compared to plan assumptions,\" Ford said in a public filing after markets closed Thursday. \"The remeasurement loss for non-U.S. plans was largely driven by changes in key plan measurement assumptions, such as improved life expectancy.\" On an after-tax basis, Ford said the remeasurement loss is expected to decrease its net income by about $500 million based on the tax impact in the jurisdictions where there are remeasurement gains and losses.Ford said its retirement plans remain fully funded and the charges would not change its expectations for pension contributions in 2026.The new special charges are in addition to about $19.5 billion in special items the company disclosed last month related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments, most of which Ford said would occur during the fourth quarter.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after markets close on Feb. 10.",

    "body": "watch nowThe gap between the best and worse off Americans is growing — and economists don't see an end in sight.The \"K-shaped\" economy has been top of mind for consumers, corporate leaders, policymakers and investors since the Covid pandemic drastically reshaped Americans' financial habits almost six years ago. Economists now warn that this two-speed economic structure is a core feature — rather than a passing fad — within the world's largest economy.\"This is not a cyclical or temporary phenomena,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"This is a structural, fundamental issue.\"The prevailing theory goes something like this: Higher-earning consumers, encouraged by rallying stock holdings and elevated property values, are splashing out on vacations and premium goods. On the other hand, after years of higher-than-ideal inflation rates, lower-income cohorts are struggling to afford necessities such as housing, groceries and gasoline.A luxury airline seat and a value meal.Mensent Photography | Moment | Mario Tama | Getty ImagesTaken together, recent data suggests that bifurcation is as exacerbated as ever.The widening gapA key measure of wealth concentration called the Gini coefficient sits at 60-year highs, according to a report from U.S. Bank published earlier this month. That signaled a reversal of the drop to multidecade lows seen amid the rollout of pandemic-era economic stimulus, said Beth Ann Bovino, the bank's chief economist.The net worth of America's top 1% hit a record share of nearly 32% in the third quarter of 2025, the Federal Reserve reported. By comparison, the bottom 50% cumulatively held 2.5% of overall net wealth.The portion of U.S. GDP heading to workers in the form of compensation tumbled to its lowest level in its more than 75-year history, per data tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means the average nonfarm business worker is seeing an increasingly small slice of an economy that has largely boomed over the last 15 years. This disparity has implications for how — and if — consumers spend their money.For instance, this divergence can explain why airlines are racing to build out luxury offerings at the same time that fast-food companies are leaning on value meals. Households with incomes under $75,000 are allocating less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than in 2019, while those above $150,000 are allotting more, according to a Bank of America report released last month.Total relative \"outlays\" — a broad measure of spending and nonmortgage payments — by U.S. consumers in the top 20% hit multidecade highs last year, a data analysis conducted by Moody's found. The other 80% tumbled to new lows, the data shows.For that 80%, overall spending hasn't outpaced inflation over the last six years, said Moody's Zandi. That means neither economic quality of life nor spending power has improved for the lion's share of U.S. taxpayers in this timeframe, he said.\"Their standard of living has not budged since the pandemic hit,\" Zandi said. \"It's just disconcerting.\"A 'winner-take-all economy'While the \"K-shape\" term became popularized as an explanation for the uneven economic recovery seen during the pandemic, economists say the origins of this breakaway can be traced back decades earlier.This type of diverging economy stems from the economic reorganization seen during the Reagan administration, according to Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at tax firm RSM. About two decades later, the structural break that created the K-shaped economy, as it's now understood, was more clearly observed in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s, he said.watch nowThat was in part due to the loss of wealth tied to the historic housing market crash, Brusuelas said. On top of that, he said the jump in joblessness limited earnings potential for those without steady employment in their prime working years.The Great Recession \"created the conditions for the winner-take-all economy that emerged in its aftermath,\" said Brusuelas, who first heard the K-shape term around 2008. \"If you live, work and inhabit certain portions of the economy, you might as well live on the dark side of the moon compared to what goes on down-market.\"Zandi pointed to the decline of unionization rates in the late 1900s as another driver of this divergence, given that it led to less negotiating power for workers.When the pandemic took hold in 2020, the stock market tanked and unemployment spiked as corporate America wondered what was coming next. But the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed over 130% since the Covid crisis' onset in March 2020, further boosting the wealth of higher-earning Americans who data shows are more likely to own stocks.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe S&P 500 since March 2020Lower-earners were seen as beneficiaries of pandemic stimulus programs and the subsequent worker shortage that led to outsized wage gains. However, Bank of America found higher-income Americans began seeing stronger wage growth last year. Spending also rose at a faster clip for top earners during much of 2025, data shows.Now, the poorest Americans feel increasingly cast out. The confidence gap between how the highest- and lowest-earners feel about their financial situation compared with five years prior grew to its widest in more than a decade in 2025, according to the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Michigan's overall sentiment index regained ground in January after tumbling near all-time lows in recent months.This can help explain the success of politicians who center campaigns on affordability.

Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesThe path forwardLooking ahead, economists expect this inequality to only intensify.Several pointed to Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" — which shrinks programs like Medicaid and food stamps aimed at the poorest citizens — as a driver of further divergence. To make meaningful inroads, the U.S. would instead need to focus on tax reform and expanding social safety nets, according to RSM's Brusuelas.Current White House affordability efforts have had \"limited impact,\" said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's head of global markets strategy. But they could ramp up ahead of the November midterm elections, Lakos-Bujas said.Trump has pushed for temporary caps on credit card interest rates and a ban on institutional investors buying homes this year. He claimed last week that the U.S. has \"virtually no inflation,\" though recent data shows price growth remains above the 2% annual rate deemed healthy by the Fed.Beyond politics, economists worry that artificial intelligence will encourage businesses to further slash workforces in an already shaky labor market. Layoffs surged more than 50% in 2025 compared with a year prior, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Amazon, Home Depot and UPS announced job cuts this week.Some have warned against planning on long-term economic growth through the K-shape. Barry Bannister, Stifel's chief equity strategist, called it \"economically unsustainable\" in a note to clients this month. The viability of having better-off consumers accounting for an outsized share of spending makes for \"a good question,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in December.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on Dec. 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesUltimately, the K-shape illustrates how the U.S. economy is reliant on small pockets of strength in several key areas, Zandi said. Because of that, he said economic growth can feel fragile or fleeting. Health care is the only sector consistently adding jobs in the labor market, Zandi noted. Megacap technology's leadership has propelled the stock market higher over recent years, the economist pointed out. Consumer spending, he said, is driven mostly by the highest earners.\"It doesn't feel like the economy's perched on a strong foundation,\" Zandi said. \"It's perched on a few poles that are sticking up. If one of those poles gets knocked out, then the whole economy gets knocked down.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersA federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday convicted a former Google software engineer of stealing trade secrets related to the search company's AI technology.The jury found 38 year-old Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets related to stealing thousands of pages of confidential information from Google to benefit the People's Republic of China, according to court documents. \"In today's high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google's AI technology on behalf of China's government,\" said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division, in a statement Friday. \"Today's verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation's most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.\"The case marks the first conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. Google executives and U.S. leaders have been vocal about the AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and China. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently told CNBC that Chinese AI models might be \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western capabilities.The jury's decision comes after Ding was originally indicted in 2024. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California oversaw the 11-day trial that led to Thursday's decision. Between May 2022 and April 2023, Ding stole more than 2,000 pages of Google's AI trade secrets and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account, the DOJ said Friday. At the time, Ding had been affiliated with two tech companies based in China and was in the process of creating his own tech company.The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture of Google's custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and the company's graphics processing unit systems, according to the DOJ. The trade secrets also included details about Google's custom-built SmartNIC, a specialized network interface card that enables high-speed communication across its AI supercomputers and cloud networking systems.Ding's attorney Grant Fondo reportedly argued that Google didn't do enough to protect the information. He argued that the documents in question were available to thousands of employees and therefore could not have contained trade secrets, adding \"Google chose openness over security,\" according to Courthouse News Service.Ding, whose next court date is Tuesday, faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, according to the DOJ.\"We're grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement to CNBC.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stakewatch now",

    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are seen in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington on Dec. 19, 2025, as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender. Date and context is unclear.U.s. Justice Department | Via ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday is releasing more than 3 million additional pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said.The large release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ was not complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to the notorious sex offender Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Blanche said Friday the DOJ was not releasing the rest of what are more than 6 million total pages identified as potentially responsive to the Epstein Transparency Act.A group of victims of Epstein in a statement blasted the DOJ for what it called the \"incomplete\" release of the files.\"This latest release of Jeffrey Epstein files is being sold as transparency, but what it actually does is expose survivors,\" said the group in a statement obtained by MS Now.\"Once again, survivors are having their names and identifying information exposed, while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected. That is outrageous. As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and retraumatized while Epstein's enablers continue to benefit from secrecy. This is a betrayal of the very people this process is supposed to serve,\" the statement said. \"The Justice Department cannot claim it is finished releasing files until every legally required document is released and every abuser and enabler is fully exposed,\" the victims said. \"We need to hear directly from Attorney General Pam Bondi when she appears before the House Judiciary Committee on February 11. Survivors deserve answers, and the public deserves the truth.\"This is not over,\" the women said. \"We will not stop until the truth is fully revealed and every perpetrator is finally held accountable. As we have always said, this is not about politics. We hope Democrats and Republicans will stand with survivors in continuing to demand the full release of the Epstein files.\"Speaking at a press conference at DOJ headquarters in Washington, Blanche said that more than 500 DOJ lawyers and other personnel had spent the past 75 days reviewing potential material related to Epstein and determining what needed to be released under the law.Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks during a press conference at the Justice Department in Washington, Jan. 30, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters\"We're releasing more than 3 million pages today, and not the 6 million pages that we collected,\" Blanche said. \"That means that the department produced approximately 3½ million pages in compliance with the act.\"He said that no more documents would be released. The large release on Friday comes weeks after DOJ released a much-smaller tranche of Epstein-related documents on Dec. 19.\"Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive documentation, document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act,\" Blanche said.Some of the material released relates to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to abuse. Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

We did not protect President Trump ... or anybody.\"President Donald Trump had been friends with Epstein for years before the two men had a falling out in the mid-2000s.\"There's not some tranche of super-secret documents about Jeffrey Epstein that we're withholding,\" Blanche said.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks on Friday said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs could be a major catalyst for the rollout of the company's closely watched experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron.In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Ricks said Lilly expects to have Medicare coverage for the treatment \"immediately following that launch, and that will change the game a bit too.\" He said that's because many patients are currently paying in cash for competitor Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill for obesity. That launched earlier this month and is off to a strong start, even with spotty insurance coverage. Ricks said he noticed that nearly all of the early adopters of Novo's Wegovy pill are new to GLP-1 treatments rather than users of existing injections, so \"it's expansive, it's reaching more patients and that's great.\" He added that Lilly is confident in its pill's ability to compete and is preparing for a \"full launch\" in the second quarter. The rollout is set to coincide with Medicare starting to cover obesity medicines for the first time later this year under drug pricing deals Lilly and Novo struck with President Donald Trump in November. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThat government coverage will bring the price point of pills even lower in the second half of the year, Ricks said. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.\"That opens up things pretty wide, and we'll see where we can go from there,\" Ricks said. Medicare coverage of obesity treatments is a long-awaited move that some health experts say could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Ricks estimates that 20 million to 30 million Medicare beneficiaries who are suffering from obesity and related health conditions could be eligible for GLP-1 treatments, so coverage is a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool.\"Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. The agreements involve drugmakers voluntarily offering their medications for less, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices abroad, and guaranteeing that so-called most-favored nation pricing for new medicines.But Ricks said volume growth of Lilly's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.' \"We think that's a positive balance for us, but time will tell,\" he said, adding that it will be based on uptake of the treatments among Medicare patients and the company's share of that adoption. Lilly will share more details on the financial impact of the deal when it posts its fourth-quarter earnings and 2026 guidance next week, he said. The price agreements include commitments to launch drugs at discounted cash-pay prices on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx. That site, which was expected to launch in January, is not yet live.Ricks said Lilly was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients through the company's platform, LillyDirect, and TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowExxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said Friday that Venezuela needs to transition to democracy in order for investment in the South American nation's dilapidated oil industry to make sense. President Donald Trump is pressuring oil companies to invest at least $100 billion in Venezuela to rebuild the country's oil industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. But Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that Venezuela is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. The Exxon CEO's blunt assessment angered the president who threatened to cut the oil major out of any future investment in the country.Woods stood by his assessment in an interview with CNBC on Friday. He said the government in Caracas needs to make major reforms for Exxon to seriously consider returning to Venezuela. \"Those priorities start with one, stabilizing the country,\" Woods told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"Second is to kick-start the economy and try to recover some of the damage that's been done over the decades of abuse that the dictators brought in, and then ultimately to transition into representative government.\" The Trump administration has not laid out a clear plan for Venezuela to hold elections and transition to a democratic government. Senior administration officials have said they are focused right now on stabilizing the country and improving its economy through oil sales. The U.S. has been working with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, who is a long-standing insider in the authoritarian regime that former President Hugo Chavez built. The cooperation with Rodriguez has raised concern among some observers that the current regime could remain in place so long as it meets the Trump administration's demands on oil. Exxon exited Venezuela in 2007 after its assets were seized by the Chavez regime. It has billions of dollars in outstanding claims against Caracas from the nationalization. \"Frankly, from our perspective, there's a principle that we stand on that if you don't uphold the sanctity of the contracts, if you choose to instead to steal the investments that we made and undermine the work that we've been doing, that we can't continue to work with you,\" Woods said. Trump told oil industry CEOs at the White House meeting that his administration is not planning to force Venezuela to play claims from the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said on Jan. 9. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world but its energy infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. Investment to repair Venezuela's infrastructure could prove financially challenging right now as a surplus of crude oil in the world has depressed prices. Oil prices in 2025 posted their steepest annual loss since 2020 as OPEC+ increased production and the U.S. continued to pump oil at a strong clip.Earlier Friday, Exxon reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, but both profit and revenue were down from the year-ago period due to weak crude prices. Notably, Exxon achieved its highest full-year net production in more than 40 years at 4.7 million barrels per day. It pumped 4.98 million bpd in the quarter with its assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana setting output records for the period.Exxon's competitor, Chevron, is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron says it can increase production in Venezuela by 50% over the next 18 to 24 months. While Exxon's stock was down more than 1% after reporting its results, its shares have had a strong start to the year. The stock has gained nearly 16% in 2026, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.6% bump. ",

Fireblocks worked with LinkedIn and law enforcement to get the profiles taken down, he added.\"Over 99% of the fake accounts we remove are detected proactively before anyone reports them,\" a LinkedIn spokesperson said in a statement.The social media platform targeted to professionals said it is constantly investing in technology to detect \"harmful behavior\" and has guardrail procedures in place, like in-message warnings when chats move off of LinkedIn and verification badges for recruiters. Last year, Bybit experienced the largest crypto heist in history when hackers stole $1.5 billion in digital assets from the cryptocurrency exchange. Analysts at blockchain analysis firm Elliptic linked the attack to North Korea's Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking collective notorious for siphoning billions of dollars from the crypto industry. The Lazarus Group's history of targeting crypto platforms dates back to 2017, when the group infiltrated four South Korean exchanges and stole $200 million worth of bitcoin.Shaulov, who helped investigate Lazarus Group's 2017 attacks on crypto platforms, said hackers, especially those tied to North Korea, have been evolving at \"light speed.\"He said in 2017 and 2018, \"it was actually quite easy\" to identify them because of grammar mistakes and typos. But now, \"it looks like they graduated from [The University of] Oxford.\"\"It's clear that the attackers have become way more sophisticated and way harder to detect because of AI,\" Shaulov said.",

    "body": "watch nowIn his first stint at the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh came to a central bank that was about to be asked to save the world. He returns now under very different circumstances, asked to serve a notoriously fickle president who will place significant but very different demands on him.Warsh indeed is a Fed veteran, serving during the critical period of 2006 to 2011 that led up to and ultimately through the global financial crisis and the central bank's efforts to stabilize the economy. Appointed by President George W. Bush, Warsh was one of the youngest members ever to serve on the board of governors.While at the Fed, Warsh played an important role in the design and implementation of emergency lending programs aimed at stabilizing credit markets. Warsh also played a key role in helping devise the myriad programs aimed at rescuing the economy. One of those programs, developed separately at the Treasury Department, became known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, developed by Neel Kashkari, who is now the Minneapolis Fed president.However, Warsh emerged from the era as a Fed critic. He warned that large-scale asset purchases and near-zero benchmark interest rates ran the risk of distorting markets and undermining long-term price stability. While supporting the earlier efforts, Warsh voted against the second round of Fed bond buying, a program known as quantitative easing.Read more CNBC news on Kevin WarshWho is Kevin Warsh?

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty Images'Central casting'Warsh has further criticized the post-financial crisis Fed with going too far in monetary policy stimulus, contending that it is helping sow the sees for further crises. In some respects, President Donald Trump is appointing a Fed chair who may be even less inclined to accommodate political pressure than Jerome Powell.Trump cited Warsh's extensive background in announcing his appointment to the top Fed post Friday morning. Warsh is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University.\"On top of everything else, he is 'central casting,' and he will never let you down,\" the president posted on Truth Social.Warsh, is a Stanford University graduate who earned his law degree from Harvard and ultimately married into the Lauder cosmetics family. Before joining the Fed, he worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley and served in the George W. Bush White House as a special assistant to the president for economic policy.While positioning himself as a defender of Fed independence, Warsh also has criticized it for mission creep and told CNBC in an interview last year that the central bank needs \"regime change.\"Warsh made his misgivings known about the current Fed. \"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during that July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Despite multiple missteps on policymaking, Chair Powell has largely been able to keep the Fed consensus together. However, in recent months that has faltered, with each of the past several meetings featuring at least one and sometimes multiple dissents. Warsh's appointment would mark a sharp philosophical shift from Powell's pragmatic, consensus-driven approach and signal a potential tightening of the Fed's tolerance for inflation and balance sheet expansion. He would fill the seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday.Miran told CNBC on Friday that he supports the pick.\"Chairman-designate Warsh has a long history of being an innovative and original thinker on monetary policy,\" Miran said. \"He's got a number of really important insights over the years, and I'm really excited to see all the good work he's going to do at the Fed.\"watch nowCan Warsh sway the Fed committee?But if Trump thinks Warsh will be able to just push through aggressive rate cuts with ease, he might be in for an unpleasant surprise. Multiple voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee have expressed resistance to cutting further until there's more evidence that inflation is definitively moving towards the central bank's 2% inflation goal. Moreover, the full group of Fed officials in December indicated they see just one more rate cut coming in 2026, then another in 2027. In the aggregate, that's in line with market expectations, with futures traders pricing in two reductions this year and none next year.Traditionally, though, the chair has been first among equals when it comes to voting on the FOMC, so Warsh may be able to tilt the group in at least a bit more dovish direction.\"We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"Because he has a hawkish reputation and is seen as independent, he is better placed to bring the FOMC along with him to deliver at least two and plausibly three cuts this year than some rivals.\"So while Warsh may prove an ideological ally of the administration, how that translates into action will be a key question.\"Analytically, we expect he will be strongly aligned with the Administration's arguments that booming productivity will allow for neutral or accommodative rates even with robust growth,\" wrote Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \"But it all depends how the data comes in, as we expect the rest of the FOMC will remain data-dependent and focused on the workhorse Fed models that Warsh has criticized.\"Warsh emerged from a competitive derby that one included 11 candidates, an array of past and present Fed officials, leading economists and a few Wall Street investment professionals including BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. That field was whittled down to five then four before Warsh emerged as the selection.Trump made no secret of the most important criteria — a willingness to slash rates lower and keep them low. The president has expressed the importance of lower rates as both a way to help the moribund U.S. housing market and to help lower financing costs for the $37 trillion U.S. debt. Before all that, he will have to be confirmed by a Senate during a ticklish political situation. The Trump Justice Department has been investigating the massive renovation project at the Fed's Washington, D.C., headquarters and has served Powell with a subpoena demanding information. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has vowed to block any Trump Fed nominees until that situation is resolved.Once that hurdle is cleared, Warsh would face a full Senate in which Republicans still command a majority.\"The Warsh pick is likely to have broad support – Democrat economist Jason Furman is out early in favor – and he should be relatively easy to confirm in the Senate,\" Guha said.

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe stock market is well-positioned to bounce next week if the heavyweight companies set to report earnings deliver strong numbers, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday. That's because the market ended the week on a subdued note, the \"Mad Money\" host said, after the S&P 500 finished in the red for three straight days.The busy week wastes no time getting underway, with Disney reporting on Monday and talk of CEO succession in the air. Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club, threw in the towel on its Disney position in November after a prolonged period of stagnant performance. \"There was always some division that held it back. I don't know which it is this time. You never do,\" Cramer said. On Tuesday, we'll get the latest from names including Pfizer, Pepsi, Merck, Advanced Micro Devices, and Chipotle. While investors will look to AMD for insights into the AI boom, Cramer said it's possible that even a terrific set of numbers will be met with selling. That's seemingly become \"the new pattern\" for chip stocks, he said. Also Tuesday, Western Digital is hosting what it's dubbed an innovation day, where the company plans to highlight innovations aimed at supporting growing data storage demand. Cramer said the upcoming event is \"critical\" after the company's stock got crushed Friday despite posting a great quarter the prior evening. \"We have to find out what that's about,\" he said.Eli Lilly reports Wednesday morning, and Cramer said he'll be watching for whether the obesity drugmaker shares any new trial results for its GLP-1 portfolio — something that could be more meaningful to the stock's movements than the quarterly results themselves. Lilly shares are down about 3.5% year to date. Alphabet, which reports Wednesday night, will be among the most consequential reports for the market. \"This is a company that many wrote off as the least of the 'Magnificent Seven,'\" Cramer said, but the narrative has completely flipped. \"Whether it be Gemini, the best of the chatbots, or YouTube, the most popular video site in the world, or Waymo ... or Google itself, doesn't matter. Alphabet is the best and when it reports, I think it could romp.\" The other tech giant reporting next week is Amazon, which will release its numbers after the close Thursday. Cramer said Amazon has become a controversial stock. When the stock finally gets momentum, Cramer said the sellers appear, eroding the gains. \"Lost in the shuffle is the greatness of the company itself,\" Cramer said, acknowledging the stock's lackluster returns of late. \"I'm a believer.\" Rounding out the week on Friday is the January employment report, which Cramer said could come in weaker than anticipated both on job gains and wage inflation. That could help support lower bond yields while enabling stocks to soar, he said. \"I think it's a distinct possibility.\" Disclosure: Cramer's Charitable Trust has positions in LLY, AMZN and GOOGL.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.watch now",

    "body": "Movie posters for the documentary \"Melania\" featuring U.S. first lady Melania Trump are displayed in a New York City subway station, in New York, U.S., Jan. 14, 2026. Jeenah Moon | ReutersIt was a turbulent week for Amazon.From a bungled email prematurely announcing another massive round of layoffs to scrutiny around the company's $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady, Amazon heads into its quarterly earnings report next week surrounded by a deafening level of outside noise. On Saturday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and a top entertainment exec from the company joined a group of CEOs, politicians and celebrities at the White House for a private screening of \"Melania,\" which was produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Melania Trump. The event was roundly criticized for appearing tone deaf as it occurred mere hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed urgent care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second such deadly incident there in less than three weeks.  While most of the biggest names in tech stayed mum on the matter, many people in the industry expressed outrage over the incidents, and urged other members of the tech community to publicly denounce the killing of Pretti and the prior shooting of Renee Good, as well as President Donald Trump's immigration policies. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who attended the screening, subsequently issued a statement calling for a \"deescalation\" after the recent violence but without mentioning the two fatal shootings. Amazon hasn't commented on the matter. watch nowAmazon's ties to the Melania film, which officially hit theatres on Friday, was awkward enough given the political tensions building in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The price tag has raised further questions about Amazon's agenda and whether the company is trying to curry favor with the president. \"I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife,\" President Trump told reporters on Thursday at a premier for the movie in Washington, D.C.. \"I think it's a very important movie. I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal, actually.\"A spokesperson for Amazon MGM said in an email, \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\"Early ticket sales for the documentary have been weak, and the film is projected to bring in about $5 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, Puck News reported, citing National Research Group forecasting data.Tough timingMaking the timing even worse for Amazon, which has also agreed to stream a three-part docuseries through Prime Video, the company on Wednesday initiated another round of mass layoffs impacting about 16,000 corporate workers. The company let go of 14,000 employees last October.  The announcement was preempted a day early by an inadvertent email sent to cloud employees, which alluded to \"organizational changes,\" and a post from Amazon's human resources boss Beth Galetti. The layoffs are part of a broader effort by Jassy to cut costs and \"remove bureaucracy\" at the company, while it pushes to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Some employees previously told CNBC that the cost cuts and rolling layoffs have damaged morale. watch nowIn a Reddit forum for Amazon employees, some users questioned the rationale of the company's money-saving efforts alongside its investment in \"Melania.\" \"With $75 million we could have given each laid off employee about $4,500,\" wrote one user. \"But instead we spent it on the ridiculous Melania movie. Ashamed to work at Amazon.\" Analysts at Citizens said this week that they expect Amazon's 30,000 job cuts to generate up to $8 billion of cost savings in 2026. In a segment for \"The Daily Show\" that aired Thursday, host Desi Lydic called it a \"cash grab,\" and criticized Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO.  \"Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?,\" Lydic said. \"Hmm, let me think.\" And filmmaker Julie Cohen, who previously worked with Amazon on documentaries, told The New York Times that the Melania price tag was abnormal and suggests the company \"is buying something else for their money.\"After he was repeatedly attacked by Trump in his first term, Bezos has cozied up to the president this time around. He's dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, and he attended the inauguration a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and helped pay for Trump's $300 million ballroom renovation. There was even more drama in the broader Bezos universe this week after multiple outlets reported that the Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013, is preparing broad layoffs across the newsroom, with the sports, local and international sections expected to be impacted.The newspaper's White House team wrote a letter to Bezos, describing the importance of the work of those teams and telling their boss that they need \"collaboration with all corners of the newsroom.\"Earnings setupBy the middle of next week, the attention on Amazon will be coming from a more familiar place: Wall Street. On Thursday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results, wrapping up earnings season for the tech giants (though Nvidia reports later in the month). Amazon is expected to report revenue growth of about 13% to $211.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. The expansion is being driven by Amazon Web Services and digital advertising, which are both projected to show growth of around 22%, based on data from FactSet.  Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upped their price target on the stock this week and kept their buy recommendation, in part due to an acceleration at AWS, boosted by a recent deal with OpenAI. Amazon is now in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed this week.As Amazon races to keep pace with rivals in AI, the company is boosting spending on data centers. In the earnings report, capital expenditures are likely to show an increase of 24% from a year earlier to almost $34.5 billion, according to LSEG. The KeyBanc analysts said that while those rising costs will weigh on profitability, \"we believe Amazon will continue looking across the organization for further efficiencies to minimize the potential margin impact.\"WATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on the 'unprecedented' demand for AI computewatch now",

Jack Taylor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nearly 60 British businesses and cultural organizations will join U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his trip to China this week, the first such state visit in eight years.Starmer is due to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on Thursday to discuss trade, investment and national security, according to an official U.K. readout that listed the business representatives accompanying the British leader.The group includes financial industry leaders such as HSBC Group Chairman Brendan Nelson and Aberdeen Group CEO Jason Windsor.Aircraft giant Airbus's general counsel John Harrison will also join, along with British Airways Chief Commercial Officer Colm Lacy.Pharmaceutical executives accompanying Starmer include AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot and GSK Chair Sir Jonathan Symonds.The visit comes as Beijing hosts a series of foreign leaders this month amid escalating U.S. tensions with its trading partners and disputes involving Greenland. Earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing. On the first Monday of 2026, Xi met Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin — the first visit by an Irish leader in 14 years — and hosted South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung later in the day. Xi also met Tuesday with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.",

    "body": "A five-month process of finding the next Federal Reserve chair appears to be down to its final days, with one candidate emerging as the betting favorite even as others remain in the mix.BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder is seen by prediction markets as the frontrunner to replace Jerome Powell at the helm of the central bank. Kalshi has the Wall Street veteran holding a 48% chance, well ahead of the next-closest competitor, former Governor Kevin Warsh, at 31%.But sentiment has been volatile, and it was Warsh who held a decided advantage less than a week ago.What has swung the pendulum seems tenuous: In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum, Trump called Rieder \"very impressive,\" and a Bloomberg News report, citing unnamed sources, said White House officials generally liked Rieder.While that was enough to sway wagers on sites like Kalshi and Polymarket, some on Wall Street are less convinced and still see it as a competitive race yet to be decided by a notoriously fickle president. With Warsh still well in the mix, some analysts also think the market's move away from National Economic Council (NEC) director Kevin Hassett is at least too hasty.The Kevins are still aliveWhile acknowledging market sentiment about Rieder, Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research, said in a note that \"we remain unconvinced\" on the money manager, adding, \"We think both Kevins are still strong possibilities.\"\"Just last week, Trump was continuing to strongly emphasize 'loyalty' as a criterion, which is an obstacle for Rieder,\" Marcus added. \"If this is still the President's mindset, that seems like an obvious problem for Rieder, who is in no way a loyalist ... We also continue to think betting markets are misinterpreting Trump's comments on Hassett.\"That's a reference to Trump, in a recent White House conversation with reporters, emphasizing that he would miss Hassett at the NEC and would prefer to see him stay in that role. However, neither Trump nor any White House officials who have spoken about the matter have dismissed Hassett as a contender. Marcus wrote off the Trump comment about Hassett as \"a cheeky quip\" that may not represent his feelings about filling the Fed chair.Former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson voiced similar views in a CNBC interview Monday, saying he still thinks the decision comes down to \"one of the Kevins.\"\"Only one person knows, and the rest of us are speculating,\" Ferguson added. He called Rieder a \"qualified person [and] Wall Street favorite ... but I really think it's unlikely that he'll be the first one across the finish line.\"There's also the possibility that Trump could play a wild card in the form of hiring someone not thought to be among the finalists. He has stated previously that he would like to name Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to the job but that the former hedge fund manager doesn't want it.Neither Rieder nor White House officials returned a request for comment.Looking at RiederShould he look Rieder's way, Trump would get someone who fits his views in many ways, including a desire for lower interest rates and a willingness to use the Fed's balance sheet to guide the economy.After the Fed approved a quarter percentage point cut in December, the third such move in a row, Rieder wrote, \"rates are still too high for the housing market to [recover] its buoyancy, and small businesses (important providers of new jobs) and young households are still struggling.\" He noted that the fed funds rate \"is excessively blunt to deal with issues better resolved through fiscal channels.\"Rieder would be an interesting choice for a number of reasons, not least because he represents a firm that is the face of globalist finance and would serve under a president known for his anti-globalist views. Though Trump has many times expressed his distaste for Powell and threatened to fire him more than once, Rieder would carry a huge similarity to the current chair in that neither has a PhD in economics, instead holding market-rich backgrounds. In Rieder's case, that meant a long stint at Lehman Brothers before the Wall Street investment banking titan imploded in 2008, an event associated with the beginning of the global financial crisis.At BlackRock, Rieder engineers a $2.5 trillion bond portfolio that includes the $14.5 billion iShares Flexible Income Active exchange-traded fund. The entire firm manages $14 trillion in client money and runs the government's Thrift Savings Plan, a federal employees' retirement fund. Moreover, the Fed called on BlackRock during the Covid crisis in 2020 to manage its controversial purchases of corporate bonds aimed at steadying capital flows at a time of extreme economic peril. Like other major financial firms and primary dealers, BlackRock officials, including its influential CEO Larry Fink, are in continuous contact with the Fed.Fed independencePotential downsides, at least from Trump's view, might be that Rieder has stated he'd like to see the Fed's key interest rate around 3%, only about half a percentage point below its current level and above desired by the president and other White House officials. He has also expressed support for Fed independence and seems unlikely to take marching orders from Trump.In a separate appearance at the World Economic Forum — held each year in Davos, Switzerland, where BlackRock plays a huge role — Trump mused about the difficulty in finding a Fed chair who would do his bidding. Few if any presidents in U.S. history have been so open about trying to influence monetary policy.\"They get the job, they're locked in for six years. They get the job and all of a sudden, 'let's raise rates a little bit,'\" Trump said, misstating the length of the four-year terms for chairs. \"It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad. It's sort of disloyalty. But they've got to do what they think is right.\"While Trump may again become dissatisfied with the next Fed chair, markets likely will welcome whomever Trump chooses, including Rieder, at least among those considered in the running.\"The BlackRock fixed income CIO, who has not worked in a policy position before, would bring a perspective grounded in deep granular bottoms-up analysis of corporate data rather than economic theory and models,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \"The market would likely welcome Rieder as one of its own.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he walks to Marine One prior to departure from the South Lawn of the White House on Jan. 27, 2026, as he travels to Iowa.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said \"we're going to de-escalate a bit,\" referring to the situation in Minnesota on the heels of the controversial killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by a federal agent in Minnesota over the weekend.Trump's comment came as he praised his border czar Tom Homan, whom he dispatched to Minnesota on Monday after outrage over the Trump administration's initial response to Pretti's death.\"He's great,\" Trump said of Homan during an interview with Fox News' Will Cain.\"And they met with the governor, the mayor, everybody else, and we'll, we're going to de-escalate a little bit,\" the president said.On Sunday, several dozen major companies in Minnesota issued a statement calling for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" in the state on the heels of Pretti's killing, which was the second time in several weeks that federal agents killed a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis.The Trump administration has flooded that city with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and other Department of Homeland Security officers in what the administration has said is widespread fraud by immigrants there.Trump earlier Tuesday told reporters that he wants \"a very honorable and honest investigation\" into the Pretti's killing.\"We're doing a big investigation,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I want to see the investigation, I'm going to be watching over it,\" he said. \"I want to see it myself.\"Shortly after Trump spoke, MS Now, citing three people briefed on the matter, reported that the Department of Justice had decided not to conduct a civil rights investigation of Pretti's death.\"And instead two units of the Department of Homeland Security will investigate their officers and the man they killed,\" MS Now reported.Trump's comments were the latest in a series of recent statements and moves by him and the White House that have sought to dial back his administration's initially bellicose comments on Pretti's killing on Saturday in Minneapolis.Pretti's death came weeks after an ICE agent in the city fatally shot the U.S. citizen and mother-of-three Renee Good, as she attempted to drive away from another agent telling her to exit her car.On Monday, Trump said that Homan would go to Minnesota to manage ICE's on-the-ground operations there.

Both officials are Democrats who for weeks have been strongly critical of the Trump administration's surge of immigration enforcement officers to Minneapolis and elsewhere.On Monday, multiple news outlets reported that Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander at large, was leaving Minneapolis, where his comments on Pretti's death and other immigration-enforcement related issues had inflamed tensions.Bovino had claimed that Pretti, who had a licensed handgun on his person at the time of the confrontation with federal agents, may have intended to \"massacre law enforcement.\"Noem and Bovino's claims have been undercut by videos taken of Pretti's shooting, which shows him on the ground when he is apparently shot from behind by an agent.During an interview with Fox News' Will Cain on Tuesday, Trump was asked if Homan's arrival and Bovino's departure were a \"pullback.\"\"I don't think it's a pullback. It's a little bit of a change,\" Trump said. \"Everybody in this room that has a business, you know, you make little changes. You know, Bovino is very good, but he's a pretty out there kind of a guy,\" the president said.\"And in some cases, that's good. Maybe it wasn't good here.\"",

    "body": "A \"sale pending\" sign in front of a home for sale in Larkspur, California, Nov. 30, 2023.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSerious headwinds in the housing market and the broader economy are tanking home sales at an alarming rate.More than 40,000 signed home purchase agreements were canceled in December, representing 16.3% of all homes that went under contract, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. That's up from 14.9% in December 2024. It's is also the highest share since Redfin began tracking the metric in 2017.\"High housing costs and rising inventory have made homebuyers more selective,\" said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin. \"Home sellers outnumber buyers by a record margin, meaning the buyers who are in the market have options and may walk away if they believe they can find a better or more affordable home.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.There were roughly 47% more home sellers than buyers in the market in December — or 631,535 more — according to a separate Redfin report. That is the largest gap in records dating back to 2013 and up 7.1 percentage points from the previous month. \"I call 2025 the year of the seller, because I had so many sellers reach out,\" said Ashley Rummage, a real estate agent from Raleigh, North Carolina, who participated in the most recent CNBC Housing Market Survey. \"They were reaching out because they had a lot of fear around the economy. They had a lot of uncertainty around the current administration, mortgage rates, affordability. These are all challenges this year.\"Regionally, Atlanta saw the highest percentage of contract cancellations in December at 22.5%. That was followed by Jacksonville, Florida, at 20.6%; San Antonio at 20.6%; Cleveland at 20.2%; and Tampa, Florida at 19.4%. Cancellations were the least common in the New York metropolitan area, San Francisco and San Jose, California.Pending sales actually dropped an outsized 9% in December from November, according to the National Association of Realtors, so the numbers were already low. Given the high rate of cancellations, closed sales in January and February are likely to be quite weak. ",

Amazon's cloud computing and stores units are among the divisions that are expected to be impacted. \"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at Amazon Web Services, wrote in an email viewed by CNBC. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"The note also references a post from Amazon's HR boss Beth Galetti and said the company notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\" The subject of the email mentions \"Project Dawn,\" and the email says it was \"canceled,\" possibly indicating it was recalled by the sender after the fact. It's unclear what Project Dawn refers to.Representatives from Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The job cuts come after Amazon announced in October that it would lay off 14,000 corporate employees. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were meant to reduce management layers and bureaucracy inside the company. He also predicted last June that efficiency gains from AI would shrink Amazon's corporate staff in the coming years.Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it was reorganizing its grocery business. Amazon said it will shutter its Fresh supermarkets and Go convenience marts to prioritize investments in Whole Foods stores and online grocery delivery. Amazon's top grocery executive Jason Buechel told staffers in a memo that the company needs to make more \"deliberate choices\" to win over customers. He also announced other restructuring moves in the division, including that he plans to appoint a \"grocery quality\" leadership role. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Feb. 5.WATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: 'Unprecedented' how much AI compute is being consumed right nowwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThis week's Federal Reserve meeting offers little suspense and probably not much action, even as massive changes loom over the central bank's longer-term direction.Judging by market expectations and policymakers' comments, there's virtually no chance the Fed will change its benchmark interest rate when the meeting ends Wednesday.Despite a recent spate of disagreements among Federal Open Market Committee members about the longer-term trajectory of monetary policy, the near-term stance likely will be one of patience as a series of cuts made last year work their way through the economy.\"Overall, the Fed just wants to stand pat. They feel they've got time to wait and see,\" former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"This feels like a wait-and-see meeting, and we should all be listening to see if there's any hint or a bias towards a future action.\"watch nowIndications of where the FOMC heads from here would come from the post-meeting policy statement as well as Chair Jerome Powell's news conference afterward. Markets currently expect the Fed to cut once or twice this year — most likely in June and December, according to futures market pricing gauged by the CME Group's FedWatch tool.However, the focus most certainly will lie beyond the interest rate decision and future guidance and into an unprecedented web of intrigue that surrounds the meeting.Storm around PowellFor one, President Donald Trump told CNBC last week that he may have narrowed down his search for Powell's successor to a single candidate, a nomination that could be announced this week and perhaps even timed to coincide with the Fed rate decision.\"If there is a single most likely window, it's during the January FOMC — particularly if Trump is lookingto redirect attention away from a Fed that didn't cut,\" Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said in a note. \"More broadly, the decision could come as soon as this week, or within the next couple of weeks.\"Also operating in the background: The Justice Department has served Powell with a subpoena seeking information on the Fed's massive renovation project on its Washington, D.C., headquarters. In an unusually candid videotaped statement, Powell called the probe a \"pretext\" for Trump's desire to bully the Fed into cutting rates even more aggressively than it has in recent months.There's uncertainty elsewhere, too, with Trump's effort to unseat Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, and Trump appointee Stephen Miran's term expiring Saturday. Fed governors can serve until they are replaced, so it's not clear how much longer Miran will stay on the board. He dissented from each of last year's three, quarter percentage point rate cuts, favoring even larger moves.So while the market will pay close attention to interest rate developments and indications, much of the scrutiny will go toward the ancillary events that have rocked the central bank.Political pressures\"While the Fed has been politically pressured to cut rates, it is not pressed by the data,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. However, Powell \"is likely to refrain from commenting directly on the Department of Justice probe involving himself and the Fed, as well as the Supreme Court's pending ruling related to Governor Cook.\"That won't stop media members from asking, though.\"Powell will be asked about his video warning that Trump DoJ subpoenas and other actions seekto subject monetary policy to the 'preferences of the president,'\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"We think he will stand by everything he said and express faith in the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of Fed independence.\"Absent further political developments, that will bring the focus back to policy.Markets will look to decipher whether the hold this month is hawkish, the precursor of an extended period of no cuts, or dovish, in which Powell and the committee indicate that more cuts are likely, just not now.Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Michael Gapen, expects to see a tilt toward dovish.\"We think recent stabilization in the labor market and solid activity data will be the main drivers behind the decision to pause rate cuts, while incoming data on inflation will keep the Fed confident enough about disinflation later this year to retain an easing bias,\" Gapen said in a note. \"We do not believe committee members are ready to signal an end to the cutting cycle.\"Gapen is also looking for several changes in the post-meeting statement, likely reflecting an upgrade to economic growth and a removal of language on increased downside risks to employment.

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersBEIJING — Chinese companies are accelerating the rollout of new artificial intelligence models as competition with U.S.-based rivals OpenAI, Anthropic and Google intensifies.Just over a year ago, China-made DeepSeek rocked global markets with the release of an AI chatbot that undercut OpenAI's ChatGPT on usage fees and production costs, raising questions about the efficacy of U.S. tech restrictions on China.On Tuesday, Beijing-based startup Moonshot AI revealed Kimi K2.5, which claimed to have video-generation and agentic capabilities that outperformed all three of the leading U.S. AI models. Agentic AI broadly refers to AI systems capable of carrying out tasks on behalf of people. The ultimate goal is to have sophisticated agents that work autonomously with minimal user interaction.The update came just about three months after Moonshot released its K2 model.Hours earlier, e-commerce giant Alibaba announced its latest generative AI model, which can create text, pictures or video based on user commands. Alibaba claimed its Qwen3-Max-Thinking outperformed major U.S. rivals on a broad benchmark test called \"Humanity's Last Exam.\" Alibaba said the new model can automatically select the best AI tool for a range of tasks and draw on past conversations as context to generate new responses more efficiently, all at little additional cost.A week earlier on Jan. 19, Z.ai released a free version of its recently launched GLM 4.7 model. Two days later, the company restricted new subscribers from signing up for its AI coding tool after demand strained its available computing power.  watch nowAlso last week, Hong Kong-traded shares of Chinese tech giant Baidu climbed to their highest level in nearly three years following the release of its latest generative AI model, Ernie 5.0. The company claimed the update outperformed Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro, but did not compare it with Google DeepMind's newest Gemini 3 Pro.Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC this month that China's AI models may be just \"months\" behind those developed in the U.S. Trying other ways to competeBeyond the rollouts, Chinese companies are pushing the adoption of homegrown technologies by making them more affordable for emerging economies.Unlike many leading U.S.-developed AI models, those from China tend to be open-sourced, typically allowing free or low-cost access and the ability to customize the model's underlying code.\"The hope is countries apart from China will use these models to ensure large amounts of applications are built on these Chinese models,\" said Alex Lu, founder of LSY Consulting. \"That's one way for Chinese companies to penetrate the market.\"There are indications that the trend is already happening. Microsoft earlier this month noted estimates that DeepSeek usage in Africa is two to four times higher than in other regions. Paying too much attention to AI benchmarks distracts from the tech's real value — when it is integrated into existing gaming or entertainment ecosystems such as Tencent's, Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note. The Chinese tech giant operates the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app as well as other popular gaming and video streaming apps in China.Tencent on Sunday announced that it will distribute 1 billion yuan ($140 million) in cash awards through its Yuanbao AI chatbot app during the Lunar New Year festival in February. The promotion mimics earlier \"red envelope\" campaigns that helped WeChat become one of the two dominant mobile payment apps just over a decade ago. It is customary for families to give relatives cash in small red envelopes during the holiday.ByteDance and Baidu are also running AI-related promotions around the upcoming holiday in a bid to retain users on their AI applications.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tEarlier this month, Alibaba updated its Qwen AI app to encourage users interacting with the chatbot to shop, order food and pay without leaving the app — thanks to integration with the company's existing e-commerce platforms such as Taobao. Qwen claims more than 100 million monthly active users.This integration could generate more revenue for Alibaba, on the assumption that the greater the number of people who use Qwen, the more they will use Taobao and shop on it, Lu said. That would help offset the costs of developing and running the underlying AI model, he said.Chinese companies are mostly competing for user traffic rather than developing the most advanced models, he said.",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday that President Donald Trump is a force to be reckoned with in the stock market — but whether he's helping or hurting companies depends on where they sit. \"You have to factor in the government as both a positive and a negative, no matter what you do,\" Cramer said on \"Mad Money,\" after outlining the impact of the president's agenda on five stocks that had notable moves in Tuesday's session. First, Cramer pointed to a group that got crushed on Tuesday: the nation's largest health insurers. Shares of UnitedHealth and Humana plummeted over 20%. CVS Health, which owns the insurer Aetna, tanked 14%. The group took a hit after the administration proposed a nearly flat reimbursement rate for Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, which was well below Wall Street analysts' expectations of a rate increase between 4% and 6%. This, as a result, could slash the federal payments these firms receive by billions of dollars. \"I'm honestly surprised it happened because both [political] parties have checked off on these price increases for years,\" Cramer said. \"It's like by rote.\" On the other hand, Cramer pointed to two names as key winners from Trump's policies. Cramer argued that quarterly earnings from General Motors showed how the White House's more lenient stance on environmental regulation benefits the automaker. With Trump in charge, Cramer said General Motors can sell more gas-powered vehicles without purchasing electric vehicle credits. The company posted better-than-expected profits early Tuesday, with shares closing up 8.75% on the day. Cramer said that CEO Mary Barra should \"take a victory lap\" after the results. \"And I agree with Barra when she says 2026 will be even better, and we have to credit this business environment and the president's support for some of that success,\" he added.Nucor is another beneficiary, according to Cramer. Although the North Carolina-based steel producer's earnings came in slightly below expectations Monday night, Cramer said Trump has still been a huge tailwind for the stock. Shares of Nucor fell 2.3% in response to earnings Tuesday, but are still up 42% over the past year. Nucor is benefiting from Trump's expansion of Section 232 tariffs, which have reduced U.S. finished steel imports significantly, allowing Nucor to capture more share.Cramer said all of this has made one thing very clear. \"The United States increasingly feels like a command economy, where you better accept the president's terms without complaints or suffer the consequences, which could be severe.\"watch now",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, silver bars are displayed at Polyak Precious Metals in San Francisco, Jan. 14, 2006.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRetail investors are betting big on major swings in silver.The question is which way the precious metal could go.Individual investors on Monday sent about $171 million on net into the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the metal, according to market research firm VandaTrack. That marked the largest single-day flow of new funds into the trust, almost double the previous peak recorded during the \"silver squeeze\" of 2021.\"Silver has just become retail's new [favorite] toy,\" Vanda analyst Ashwin Bhakre wrote on Tuesday.Monday's rush came as the Silver Trust climbed nearly 6%, driving its 2026 rally to more than 52% and extending last year's nearly 145% advance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe SLV ETF, year to dateLast week, silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time.Bhakre said silver has surpassed technology stocks to become the epicenter of retail fervor. Well-known tech stocks including Nvidia, Tesla and Palantir were among the most bought individual names by mom-and-pop traders in 2025, according to Vanda.But silver is now an even hotter trade than Nvidia, the high-flying artificial intelligence beneficiary that has enchanted Wall Street since late 2022. Silver's turnover momentum, which gauges trading acceleration, has jumped to 11.55 times its normal level — higher than Nvidia's 7.54 times.As a result, \"in relative terms, the 'chase' in silver is now more intense than the classic AI trade,\" Bhakre said.Heightened interest in silver, once known as the poor man's gold, has a \"halo effect\" for mining stocks, Bhakre said. Hecla Mining and Coeur Mining have seen flows of new cash jump to more than twice their normal pace, Vanda data shows. Hecla and Coeur shares have soared almost 40% or more just since New Year's. But Bhakre said investors are waging a \"two-front war\" in silver.On the bearish side, Vanda found abnormally high flow ratios into the ProShares UltraShort Silver (ZSL), showing plenty of individual investors are making leveraged bets that the price will crash, Bhakre said.Still, retail investors no longer appear to just be looking to play a squeeze on precious metal prices, Bhakre said. Instead, the group is \"structurally repositioning\" to gain exposure to a longer-lived, hard-asset cycle.watch nowOthers are doubtful.LossDog founder Tom Sosnoff described silver's price action in less than a month as equivalent to what would typically occur over several years, calling the move a \"meme stock trade\" in terms of both surging trading volume and high volatility.Gold and silver are \"absolutely, kind of, the meme commodity of 2026,\" Sosnoff said on CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange.\" \"The silver move has been wild.\"\"The trade's been unbelievable, but it's been very one-way,\" he added. \"I think it's taken a lot of hostages on the way up, because the ... trading street is short.\"Read more CNBC reporting on retail investorsFive years after the GameStop mania, retail investors have become a force Wall Street can't ignoreRetail traders keep their hot streak goingEveryday investors turn to energy following U.S. strike on VenezuelaRetail investors close out one of their best years ever.

    "body": "Mark Surman, president of Mozilla Foundation, speaks at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival in New York City, U.S., May 22, 2024. Andrew Kelly | ReutersFrom his small, snow-covered farm outside Toronto, home to cats and a dog, and soon some donkeys, Mark Surman has been laying the groundwork for a fierce battle with the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, located about 2,300 miles away in the San Francisco area.The bespectacled 56-year-old is president of Mozilla, a nonprofit organization best known for its Firefox browser and a pledge to keep the internet open and accessible to all. Having taken on Microsoft in the browser market in the early 2000s, and Apple and Google in the years that followed, Mozilla is right at home playing the role of underdog. These days, Surman is preoccupied with the tech industry's influence over the next big thing: AI. And it's too big of a challenge for Mozilla to tackle on its own. Surman is building what he's described as \"a rebel alliance of sorts,\" using a phrase that's long been part of Mozilla's lexicon. In this case, the alliance is a loose network of tech startups, developers and public interest technologists committed to making AI more open and trustworthy and to checking the power of industry heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic.\"It's that spirit that a bunch of people are banding together to create something good in the world and take on this thing that threatens us,\" Surman told CNBC in an interview. \"It's super corny, but people totally get it.\"In practice, Mozilla is focused on deploying its roughly $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support \"mission driven\" tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, according to a report the organization released Tuesday. It's pursuing investments that promote AI transparency, and can potentially act as a counterforce to companies that are growing at historic rates with limited guardrails. Financially, Mozilla is at a massive disadvantage. In 2022, it launched a venture capital fund called Mozilla Ventures and pledged to invest an initial $35 million in early-stage companies. It's now exploring raising additional funds.     Mozilla's cash pile is dwarfed by OpenAI, which has raised more than $60 billion from investors across the globe, and its rival Anthropic, which has raised more than $30 billion, according to PitchBook. Tech megacaps like Google and Meta are also sparing no expense, shelling out billions of dollars to hire AI researchers and tens of billions a year to build out massive data centers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersMozilla represents a growing swath of the AI industry that's afraid of what OpenAI has become and the power that it now wields.When OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015, its stated goal was to \"advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\" But in the decade that followed, OpenAI turned into a commercial entity with astronomical growth rates, transformed largely by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. OpenAI now sports a $500 billion valuation, and completed a recapitalization in October that cemented its future as a for-profit business under the umbrella of a nonprofit. It's a structure that resembles Mozilla, but the similarities end there. Only a few of OpenAI's co-founders, including CEO Sam Altman, remain at the company, and a number of early employees who left have been sharply critical of what they broadly describe as a focus on growth at the expense of safety. Among the loudest critics is co-founder Elon Musk, who departed in 2018, started a competitor called xAI in 2023, and then sued OpenAI and Altman for alleged breach of contract and financial damages. OpenAI has dismissed Musk's efforts as part of a \"campaign of harassment,\" and the case is expected to head to trial in April.OpenAI didn't provide a comment, and xAI returned CNBC's request for comment with an automated response.Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers who disagreed with the company's direction. But, even as it's taken a more pro-safety stance in AI development, Anthropic has been racing alongside AI commercially, commanding a $350 billion valuation. Multiple battles at onceMozilla's uphill battle is even steeper because of the position of the Trump administration, which is determined to stay ahead of China in the global AI race and has been quick to lash out at companies, states and lawmakers that are perceived as potential threats to that agenda.David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as the administration's AI and crypto czar, accused Anthropic of supporting \"woke AI\" in October due to its approach on regulation. President Donald Trump in December signed an executive order for a single regulatory framework for AI, establishing a litigation task force to challenge state AI laws, namely those led by Democratic lawmakers.An Anthropic spokesperson declined to comment, but directed CNBC to a blog post from CEO Dario Amodei in October. Amodei wrote in the post that Anthropic had increased its revenue run rate from $1 billion to $7 billion in nine months, \"and we've managed to do this while deploying AI thoughtfully and responsibly.\"David O. Sacks, chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, speaks to President Donald Trump next to Sriram Krishnan, senior White House policy advisor on artificial intelligence, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as Trump signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | ReutersSurman remains undeterred, and says Mozilla will be able to help \"do for AI what we did for the web.\" \"There is an alternative that's real and is emerging, and it's a lot of small pieces that add up to that alternative,\" Surman said. \"The people in it are hungry to look where there's weak spots in the current market and take advantage of them.\"Mozilla has long viewed itself as a rebel. In the 2024 \"State of Mozilla\" report, Surman used the phrase \"rebel alliance\" to describe the coalition of players that helped disrupt Microsoft's dominance over the web. In 2020, Mozilla published a report titled \"Mozilla & the Rebel Alliance,\" which was dedicated to the organization's alliance of \"tens of thousands of people around the globe who believe in Mozilla.\"Even so, Surman said it took some time to convince his colleagues that the moniker applied to the AI era. That process actually started long before generative AI took off. In 2019, Surman shifted the philanthropic and advocacy efforts of the Mozilla Foundation to focus on \"trustworthy AI.\" By the spring of 2023, Mozilla had launched its venture firm and its own AI company, Mozilla.ai. The following year, Surman said Mozilla's leadership agreed that keeping AI \"trustworthy and open\" was a fight worth picking. While its biggest priority remains growing and investing in Firefox, investing in the rebel alliance is \"at the heart of who Mozilla is today,\" according to the report on Tuesday. Supporting startups is central to that strategy.Mozilla Ventures has invested in more than 55 companies to date, including dozens of AI startups, with more deals to come in 2026.

Mozilla has supported open-source technology since its origin in 1998. But Spitznagel isn't completely sold on Surman's rebel alliance concept. She said it's a \"fun analogy\" and wants to be aligned with the movement to enable trustworthy AI, but also wants in on the broader AI transformation.\"Rebel is a word that for me, personally, it has the wrong association,\" Spitznagel said in an interview. \"I do think about [AI] a bit differently, but I also want to be part of the revolution that actually enables us to deploy AI and not hinder it.\"Tony Salomone and Ali Asaria, co-founders of Mozilla portfolio company Transformer Lab, said they're similarly on the fence. \"I'm not going to lie, I sometimes talk that way to get people kind of excited or engaged in our way of thinking,\" Salomone said. Founded in 2024, Transformer Lab is building open-source tools that developers can use to build, train and evaluate advanced AI models. The company has yet to publicly disclose any funding and, as of November, had fewer than 10 employees, mostly based in Canada. Asaria said rebel alliance isn't a term he's used, but that there is an ecosystem of smaller AI companies that keep in touch and regularly cross paths at conferences and other events. \"There's definitely a group of folks who are interested in this idea of trying to be sustainable companies that can have an impact on the industry and have an appreciation for AI, but don't want to see just a few big companies win,\" Asaria said. 'Taking a lot of shortcuts'When it comes to the big companies in AI, Surman cautioned that a \"winner-takes-all\" mentality still lurks behind their open-source efforts. He said their contributions to open-source communities are welcome, but that those same companies will \"eat you if you're not careful.\"It's an issue that resonates with Oumi CEO Manos Koukoumidis. Backed by Mozilla, Oumi operates an open-source platform that researchers and engineers can use to train, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy AI models. Koukoumidis previously spent around a decade working in AI at Microsoft, Facebook and most recently Google, where he became disillusioned with the future he was building. While all the big tech companies contribute to a variety of open-source projects, some of which they manage, Koukoumidis said the bigger objective at the \"tech mammoths\" is dominance. In terms of safety, he is \"very confident that they're taking a lot of shortcuts.\"Koukoumidis and Surman agree that a much larger community of researchers and entrepreneurs should be collaborating to advance AI, which is one of the goals of Oumi. \"Even the couple thousand people that are at OpenAI, Anthropic or anywhere else, because they're operating in a silo, they're not enough to advance this technology sufficiently, safely, cost efficiently, sustainably,\" Koukoumidis said in an interview. \"What's happening right now, it's complete insanity. We're wasting billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions.\"JOSEP LAGO | AFP | Getty ImagesBut Koukoumidis knows that abandoning a high-paying job at a place like Google has its drawbacks. He has substantially fewer resources at his disposal, and said his decision to leave the company was \"intimidating.\" When the Transformer Lab team set out to raise funding in Silicon Valley and Canada, they were repeatedly told that it was going to be \"technically impossible\" for them to compete. \"When you enter into the space of AI as a new startup, it's scary, because these few companies control so much more than just the intellectual property,\" Asaria said. They control funding and access to infrastructure, making it \"very hard to just walk into the space without starting with $100 million or a billion dollars,\" he said.Surman acknowledges he has to play the long game.By 2028, he wants Mozilla to be funding a growing open-source AI ecosystem that's on its way to becoming \"mainstream\" for developers. And he's determined to prove that Mozilla's approach is economically viable. Mozilla is targeting a series of financial metrics over the next few years, including 20% annual growth in nonsearch revenue, according to a November report.\"For many people, the idea that open-source AI can win, or this rebel alliance, that those players can actually take a piece of the market, they find it hard to believe,\" Surman said. \"But there's a bunch of trends that are underway.\"WATCH: AI honeymoon is over and this will be its hardest year yet, says Deutsche Bank’s Adrian Coxwatch now",

    "body": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Jan. 27, 2026. Patrick Doyle | ReutersCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday denied Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claim that, in a private call with President Donald Trump, he had backtracked on some of the remarks from his much-discussed speech in Davos, Switzerland, last week.\"To be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos,\" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday morning, pushing back on Bessent's remarks from the night before.Bessent, in a Fox News interview Monday night had said Carney was \"very aggressively walking back some of the unfortunate remarks he made at Davos\" during a call with Trump earlier in the day.In his address to the World Economic Forum, Carney had declared that the established U.S.-led world order was in the \"midst of a rupture.\" And he pointedly warned that the \"bargain\" of an American hegemony \"no longer works,\" adding that \"great powers\" have exploited and weaponized economic tools like tariffs.The speech — which came as Trump was aggressively pressuring Europe to sell Denmark-owned Greenland to the U.S. — received a rare standing ovation at Davos.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says he wants 'very honorable and honest investigation' of Alex Pretti killingDemocrats to Trump: Fire Kristi Noem or risk her impeachmentThe government is barreling toward a partial shutdown over DHS funding.

Those claims were later contradicted by video evidence and analyses from multiple news outlets. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cited Noem's statements about Pretti on the Senate floor on Tuesday and joined calls for Trump to fire Noem.\"Kristi Noem is a liar, she's vicious. She's also incompetent. Donald Trump must fire her at once before another American is killed under her watch,\" Schumer said.Trump on Tuesday said \"no\" when a reporter at the White House asked him if Noem would leave her post.Noem is doing \"a very good job,\" Trump told reporters before a planned trip to Iowa.Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that, \"DHS enforces the laws Congress passes, period. If certain members don't like those laws, changing them is literally their job.\"\"While ICE officers are facing a staggering 1,300% spike in assaults, too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws and did nothing while Joe Biden facilitated an invasion of tens of millions of illegal aliens into our country. It's time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem's leadership,\" McLaughlin's statement continues.The warning by House Democrats comes as a partial government shutdown looms amid concerns over DHS funding.\"Taxpayer dollars are being weaponized by the Trump administration to kill American citizens, brutalize communities and violently target law-abiding immigrant families. The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,\" the leaders said in their statement.The House last week passed a more than $1.2 trillion spending package that included funding for DHS and other agencies. But the Senate has only until 12:01 a.m. Saturday to pass the bills and keep the government fully funded.The killing of Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, has prompted outrage among Senate Democrats, who have called for the DHS bill to be stripped from the larger spending package in exchange for their votes.Democratic support for the spending bills is needed to clear the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.\"Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,\" Schumer said in a statement Monday. \"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If [Majority  Leader John] Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\" Trump and the White House this week softened the administration's stance on Pretti, seemingly walking back earlier statements made by administration officials like Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, who labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Monday.Still, tensions remain high after the deaths of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, another citizen killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.DHS recently launched an immigration enforcement investigation in Minnesota, sending federal agents to the state in response to an ongoing social services fraud scandal and targeting thousands of refugees.Minnesota state officials and congressional Democrats have sharply condemned the tactics used by DHS and ICE, and some congressional Republicans have also called for increased oversight.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday called on the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which he chairs.He also called for an \"independent investigation\" into the shooting.\"Local police routinely, put officers involved in deadly shootings on administrative leave until an independent investigation is concluded. That should happen immediately. I can't recall ever hearing a police chief immediately describing the victim as a 'domestic terrorist' or a 'would-be assassin,'\" Paul said in a post to X on Tuesday.   \"For calm to be restored, an independent investigation is the least that should be done,\" he wrote.ICE, CPB, and USCIS officials agreed Tuesday to testify at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Feb. 10.",

    "body": "Activity on Elizabeth Street (at the intersection of Bourke St Mall), Melbourne on a cloudy day.Charlie Rogers | Moment | Getty ImagesAustralia's inflation came in at 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2025, its highest level in six quarters, reinforcing warnings from policymakers that interest rate cuts this year are likely to be limited.The fourth-quarter reading was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters and up from the 3.2% seen in the third quarter. On a quarterly basis, inflation rose 0.6%, also matching the Reuters forecast and easing sharply from the 1.3% seen in the previous quarter.For December, inflation in Australia rose 3.8% year on year, exceeding the 3.55% expected by economists.The Australian Bureau of Statistics said housing was the largest contributor to the rise in December, with prices rising 5.5%.Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as recreation and culture, also contributed to the month's price gains.The higher inflation reading will prompt the central bank to maintain a \"cautious stance,\" according to Shier Lee Lim, Lead FX & Macro Strategist for Asia Pacific at foreign exchange firm Convera. While Lim said a rate hike at the bank's February policy meeting is unlikely, further tightening cannot be ruled out if inflation remains sticky and above target in the coming quarters.The Reserve Bank of Australia aims to keep inflation within a 2% to 3% target range.'Too high' for rate cutsThe inflation reading follows recent comments from Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser, who said that inflation at current levels is \"too high.\" \"Inflation above 3%, let's be clear, is too high. We're charged to keep inflation between two to three per cent and it's currently above that,\" Hauser said in an interview with ABC on Jan. 8. Hauser said the likelihood of further rate cuts in the near term was \"probably very low.\"His remarks echoed comments from RBA Governor Michele Bullock after the RBA's rate decision on Dec. 9, when she said that interest rate cuts were not on the horizon for the foreseeable future.Australia's economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter, expanding from a revised 2% in the second quarter and marking its fastest growth in about two years. Bullock said in December that rate cuts were not needed at that time, citing a recovery in private-sector activity and growth surpassing public demand.",

    "body": "Parents with children under age 18 can now begin registering for a new type of tax-advantaged savings account known as a Trump account when filing their 2025 tax returns. Register for the account, experts say, but don't wait for contributions to begin in July if you want to save for your children's futures.That's because Trump accounts aren't the only way to save for a child's future, especially for major expenses like college, says Alex Canellopoulos, a certified financial planner and director of investments at Vista Capital Partners.Take the \"free money,\" Canellopoulos says: For children born between 2025 and 2028, the Trump accounts will include a $1,000 federal deposit for parents who opt in, and children born before 2025 may be eligible for a $250 grant funded by a private $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell.But if you expect to pay for your child's education in the future, Canellopoulos says to also start saving now with a 529 college savings plan.\"The earlier you can save, the better,\" Canellopoulos says. \"We know how expensive college is already. If you believe your kid will go to college in the future, I wouldn't count on these expenses going down.\"529s versus Trump AccountsTrump accounts and 529 plans are both tax-advantaged vehicles designed for a child's future, but fundamentally, they serve different financial purposes with different time horizons, Canellopoulos says.A 529 plan is a state-sponsored savings tool that offers tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified education costs. In contrast, a Trump account is essentially a retirement savings vehicle for newborns designed to build long-term wealth, Canellopoulos says.Though they will come with some penalty-free exceptions for qualified events, Trump Accounts will eventually convert into traditional individual retirement accounts and are subject to traditional IRA withdrawal rules once a beneficiary turns 18.Here's a closer look at the differences between these accounts. \"There is no reason to delay funding a 529,\" Canellopoulos says. If you have the means, you can fund both once the Trump accounts become available, but if you know you want to save for education, start with a 529, he says.529s funds can roll over into retirementIt may be easier to fund a 529 before a Trump account even if you do want to set aside money for your child's retirement, says Ajay Kaisth, a CFP and principal at KAI Advisors in Princeton Junction, New Jersey.Over a beneficiary's lifetime, up to $35,000 in unused 529 funds can be transferred to a Roth IRA in their name, provided the 529 account has been open for at least 15 years. These transfers are subject to annual Roth IRA contribution limits and the beneficiary must have earned income. Once in a Roth IRA, funds grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, as long as the account has been open for at least five years. Contributions, however, can generally be withdrawn tax and penalty-free at any time.Trump account beneficiaries have the option to convert their funds into a Roth IRA after their account becomes a traditional IRA. However, because these accounts may mix post-tax parental gifts with pre-tax federal grants and employer contributions, detailed record-keeping is essential, and converting could be a hassle, Kaisth says.\"If the goal is to fund a child's education and retirement, in my mind, a 529 plan becomes the more beneficial option,\" Kaisth says. Open a Trump account for the \"free money\" if you're eligible, but if you're looking for simplicity, fund the 529 first, Kaisth says. Ultimately, \"the earlier you start whichever, the better it is.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

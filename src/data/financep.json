    "body": "Nvidia H100 chips inside a server room at the Yotta Data Services Pvt. data center, in Navi Mumbai, India, March 14, 2024.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmerican AI chip darling Nvidia is expanding its partnerships in India, including with venture capital firms, as it bets on the country's AI ecosystem that has drawn massive Big Tech investments. The company in statement on Wednesday said it was working with several venture capital firms, including Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and Accel India to identify and fund AI startups.This comes as venture capital investors have been increasingly showing interest in India's technology startups, with the country's strong initial public offerings market providing lucrative returns. India is currently holding an AI summit that has seen major tech CEOs as well as heads of states participate in the event. Nvidia top boss Jensen Huang was also expected to attend it but withdrew due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\" More than 4,000 AI startups in India's have already joined Nvidia's global startup program, which helps tech startups build, scale, and go to market, according to the chip designer. The world's largest company by market cap also said it was collaborating with government agencies and research institutions, as well as continuing efforts to build the country's domestic data centers.Nvidia's efforts are framed around New Delhi's \"IndiaAI mission,\" aimed at strengthening the country's AI capabilities and free up funding for its AI entrepreneurs. More broadly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has set goals for India to grow into a global tech superpower. As of September last year, New Delhi had approved $18 billion worth of semiconductor projects as it looks to build a domestic supply chain.Nvidia has also partnered with Indian cloud providers such as Yotta, Larsen & Toubro, and E2E Networks to provide its AI chip clusters and help build data centers in the country.A New Delhi official reportedly said Tuesday that the country expects as much as $200 billion in investments for data centers over the next few years.India's Adani has announced plans to invest $100 billion toward renewable energy-powered AI-ready data centers. American tech firms including hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft and Google have committed more than $50 billion toward AI infrastructure and chips in the country.Meanwhile, Nvidia said it was also supporting India's AI companies through its \"NVIDIA Nemotron models\" — a family of Nvidia AI models that organizations can use to build new chatbots, agents, and speech systems. These Nvidia models can be used by Indian companies to train new AI systems on India-specific data and language, aligning with the the country's goal of build sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a country's ability to build artificial intelligence based on its own infrastructure, data and industry, so that increasingly critical AI systems don't depend on foreign providers.",

    "body": "Containers at a shipping terminal in Yokohama, Japan on Oct. 18, 2021. Japan's trade deficit surged in September as imports overwhelmed export growth.Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapanese exports climbed 16.8% year on year in January, sharply beating market expectations and growing at their fastest rate since November 2022 as shipments to Asia and Western Europe surged, government data on Wednesday showed.Growth was higher than December's 5.1%, and beat Reuters-polled economists' estimates of 12%.  Value of exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, jumped 32%, after rising 5.6% in December at a time when the two countries are locked in a diplomatic standoff over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments over Taiwan.Shipments to the U.S. fell 5%, after declining 11.1% in December. Washington is Japan's second largest trading partner.Region-wise, a near 26% jump in shipments to Asia and over 25% to Western Europe helped accelerate exports growth, and more than offset the 3.3% decline in North America.  Food, machinery and electrical machinery — which includes chips — were commodities that saw the sharpest growth, up 31.3%, 14.3% and 27.3%, respectively. Transport equipment, which contributed over 20% to exports, climbed by 0.8%. The segment, which includes cars and auto parts and has been a key growth driver for Japanese exports, has come under pressure following U.S. tariffs.Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index rose 0.9%, while the broader Topix gained 1.26%. The yen marginally strengthened to 153.43 against the U.S. dollar, while yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds was was down 1 basis point at 2.119%.   Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNikkei 225 performance so far this yearImports in January fell 2.5% year on year, compared with Reuters estimates of a 3% rise, and a 5.1% jump in the prior month. The stellar growth in outbound shipments will be a welcome start to the new year after Japan's exports growth declined to 3.1% last year, compared to the 6.2% rise seen in 2024.The Japanese economy expanded by just 0.1% year on year in the fourth quarter, supported by private demand, but net exports shaved 0.8 percentage point off growth. For the full year, GDP grew 1.1% year on year, also weighed down by net exports. Japanese shipments fell during the middle of 2025, hit by U.S. tariff worries, but saw a rebound toward the end of the year after a trade deal with the U.S. was announced that saw duties slashed to 15%.The U.S. on Tuesday announced projects valued at $36 billion, according to a Reuters report, including an oil export facility in Texas, an industrial diamonds plant in Georgia and a natural gas power plant in Ohio, to be financed by Japan as part of its $550 billion U.S. investment pledge.\"Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched! Japan is now officially, and financially, moving forward with the FIRST set of Investments under its $550 BILLION Dollar Commitment to invest in the United States of America,\" U.S. President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Last week, Japan's Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted by public broadcaster NHK as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Takaichi and Trump met.Trump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTesla Europe announced plans to add xAI's Grok, an AI chatbot, to its vehicle infotainment systems in the U.K. and eight other markets across Europe.It remains to be seen if the addition of this technology will revitalize Europeans' interest in buying Teslas.Elon Musk's automaker saw electric vehicle sales in Europe decline by 27%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA. The decline for Tesla came as Europeans' continued strong adoption of battery electric vehicles. BEVs, the only kind that Tesla makes, represented 17.4% of the market across Europe in 2025 according to the ACEA. China's BYD gained market share across the continent with innovative, and more affordable, EV models.Tesla's lack of affordable new models last year, and an ongoing consumer backlash in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, and endorsements of anti-immigrant extremists including Tommy Robinson in the U.K. and Germany's AfD party weighed on the appeal of the Tesla brand last year, according to Brand Finance. Tesla is not the only automaker integrating chatbot features into its infotainment systems. For example, Volvo has announced plans to add a Google Gemini-based conversational AI assistant to its EX60 electric vehicles. During a fourth-quarter earnings update, Tesla revealed that it had invested $2 billion into Musk's xAI.After that, Musk's aerospace and defense juggernaut, SpaceX, acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Before those deals, xAI had merged with social network X (formerly Twitter), and its Grok product had become the subject of myriad regulatory probes in Asia, Australia and throughout Europe including by regulators in Ireland, the U.K., France and the European Commission.As CNBC previously reported, Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake explicit images based on photos or clips of real people without their consent, including deepfake images depicting child sexual abuse. Last summer, Grok generated and spread antisemitic hate speech across social network X and praised Adolf Hitler, drawing earlier regulatory probes by the European Commission.A Tesla owner in Canada raised the alarm about Grok's lack of safeguards after it was added to her vehicle. As CBC reported, her son used Grok to generate entertaining comments about soccer athletes, and Grok eventually asked the minor to send nudes. Tesla and xAI have not said whether they can limit minors' access to Grok in Tesla vehicles, or moderate outputs of the chatbot to be appropriate for minors by default.Besides criticism of Grok's lax safety guardrails, driver distractibility remains a point of concern.Mike Nelson, who is a partner at Nelson Law and an automotive safety researcher, said his own Tesla Model Y features Grok in the U.S., and he has enjoyed using it. However, the addition of chatbot technology to vehicles' infotainment systems, he said, introduces a new \"distraction layer\" for drivers. \"Research shows that even in hands-free mode, you are more distracted when you are talking on the phone and driving,\" Nelson said. \"Adding Grok introduces more stimuli.\" A professor of machine learning and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, Rayid Ghani, told CNBC that researchers and regulators, and insurance companies especially, should hasten to conduct \"practical evaluations\" of chatbots.With a lack of benchmarking and standards across the industry, he said, \"we do not yet understand the information needs of drivers, how well Grok or other chatbots fulfill those needs compared to other options and whether chatbots may change driving behavior and exactly how.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "body": "Michael Selig, President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, testifies in a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on his nomination on Capitol Hill, Nov. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an amicus brief in federal court on Tuesday to assert the agency's right to enforce prediction markets instead of individual states, according to its new chairman, Michael Selig.Selig argued in a Monday Wall Street Journal op-ed that the CFTC has always had authority over prediction markets and determining whether the event contracts constitute gambling, as critics allege. Selig noted nearly 50 active legal cases against prediction markets and said the CFTC would be stepping in to prevent state encroachment.\"The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,\" he wrote.The move comes as prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket face legal challenges in multiple states over event contracts. The platforms allow users to bet on the outcomes of events in pop culture, sports, entertainment and more.Critics of prediction markets have argued that the offerings amount to little more than gambling, though Kalshi has defended its platform and argued that it abides by federal regulations. Sports betting on the prediction platforms has drawn comparisons to legalized sports betting in the U.S. In his first public comments as CFTC chairman at the end of January, Selig said he was prepared to draft new, clear rules to govern prediction markets and revisit the agency's rules on involvement in federal and circuit court cases.\"Where jurisdictional questions are at issue, the Commission has the expertise and responsibility to defend its exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives,\" he said at the time.In his Monday op-ed, Selig said event contracts \"serve legitimate economic functions\" and operate under CFTC rules as \"swaps\" rather than gambling. He also posited that trading on event contracts is beneficial for the market and for Americans at large.\"These exchanges aren't the Wild West, as some critics claim, but self-regulatory organizations that are examined and supervised by experienced CFTC staff,\" Selig wrote.In a Tuesday video posted to X, Selig said his message to those who challenge the CFTC's authority is clear: \"We will see you in court.\"\"Today, the CFTC is taking an important step to ensure that these markets have a place here in America and have the integrity and resilience and vibrancy that our derivative markets deserve,\" he said.Selig said the amicus brief would be filed in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in support of Crypto.com in its dispute with the Nevada Gaming Control Board.CNBC could not verify that the amicus brief had been filed.Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a CNBC minority investment.",

The man, who was also wearing \"tactical gloves,\" then laid down on the ground and was taken into custody, Sullivan said.When officers looked in the white Mercedes SUV from which the man had emerged, they found \"a Kevlar helmet and a gas mask in the vehicle,\" according to Sullivan.The man's shotgun was loaded, and he was carrying additional rounds, the police chief said. Police did not immediately share the suspect's identity, but Sullivan described him as an 18-year-old who does not live in the area. The vehicle was not registered to the man, and police are looking at multiple addresses to \"chase out where he actually came from,\" Sullivan said.No motive is known at this time, Sullivan told the press.The chief commended the officers who apprehended the suspect, adding this is why police at the Capitol conduct monthly active-shooter exercises.\"Who knows what could have happened if we wouldn't have officers here standing guard like they do every single day,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

James Talarico speaks during a U.S. Senate campaign launch rally in Round Rock, Texas, Sept. 9, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesStephen Colbert ripped CBS for barring him from airing on his late-night TV show an interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate.\"You know who's not one of my guests tonight? That's Texas Representative James Talarico,\" Colbert told his show's studio audience for Monday night's broadcast of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\"He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" said Colbert, drawing boos from the crowd.\"Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on,\" Colbert said.\"And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this,\" Colbert said to laughs and applause.\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" during the June 25, 2025, show.Scott Kowalchyk | CBS | Getty ImagesColbert suggested that CBS' move was the result of concern that the network would draw the ire of the Federal Communications Commission.Colbert's comments are the latest escalation in tension between talk show hosts and the FCC, following the brief suspension by ABC of fellow late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel's show last summer.The FCC last month issued guidance to the three broadcast networks, reminding them of the 1934 law that requires networks to provide equal opportunity for coverage for political candidates if their opponents appear on air. The guidance pointedly said there is no evidence that late-night and daytime talk show interviews would qualify for an exemption allowed under the law for \"bona fide\" news coverage.Colbert, during Monday's show, pointed to reports earlier this month that the FCC was investigating the ABC daytime talk show \"The View\" because of an appearance by Talarico on that program.CBS, in a statement to CNBC, said, \"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico.\"\"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett [D-Texas], and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled,\" CBS said.\"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTalarico on Tuesday posted a link to his interview with Colbert, which was available online.In a statement provided to CNBC by his Senate campaign, Talarico said, \"I think [President] Donald Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas. This is the party that ran against cancel culture.\"Now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, and what we read,\" Talarico said. \"This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top. A threat to one of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights.\"Talarico is in a close Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat against Crockett, in which early voting began Tuesday. The winner will face off against the winner of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Democrats last won a statewide race in Texas in 1994.The FCC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether CBS would have run afoul of agency guidance by airing Talarico's interview.FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, in a statement, called CBS' decision \"yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this Administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech.\"\"The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression,\" Gomez said. \"CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing,\" Gomez said. \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS' parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content. The FCC is powerless to impose restrictions on protected speech, and any attempt to intimidate broadcasters into self-censorship undermines both press freedom and public trust.\"I once again urge broadcasters and their parent companies to stand firm against these unlawful pressures and continue exercising their constitutional right to speak freely and without government interference,\" Gomez said.Paramount Skydance has launched a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, a deal that would require regulatory approval from the federal government if WBD shareholders accept the offer.CBS in July said Colbert's show would be canceled in May.That announcement came shortly after Colbert blasted the network for giving what he called a \"big fat bribe\" to Trump. Paramount Skydance, earlier had agreed to pay $16 million for Trump's future presidential library to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.A week after CBS said it was canceling Colbert's show, the FCC approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media.Colbert, in September, spoke up for Kimmel when ABC pulled Kimmel off the air following remarks by FCC Chair Brendan Carr that the network's broadcast license was at risk because of comments Kimmel made about the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Kimmel's show returned to the air about a week later.",

    "body": "Mike's Red Tacos, based in San Diego, is best known for its birria tacos, but its menu features more than just the buzzy regional Mexican food.Source: Mike's Red TacosThe restaurant investors behind the success of Dave's Hot Chicken are making a new nationwide bet on the next-hottest restaurant trend: birria.Mike's Red Tacos, a San Diego-based birria chain with just two locations, plans to announce on Tuesday a new franchising initiative that will build hundreds of restaurants across the U.S., with support from early-stage backers Bill Phelps and Andrew Feghali, CNBC can report. Financial terms of their investment, which took place in early 2025, were not disclosed.\"We just saw that this was a brand and a concept that really had legs to it,\" Phelps told CNBC. \"And then the critical thing is, we brought down prospective franchisees. ... Everyone gave it the thumbs up.\"Phelps said he had never heard of birria before Feghali introduced him to Mike's.Traditional birria is a beef or goat stew, slow cooked with spices and chiles to give the meat lots of flavor. Birria tacos, like those sold at Mike's, use the slow-cooked meat as a filling and usually include a consomme on the side as a dip for the taco. Once known as a regional Mexican food, birria now appears on 3.7% of U.S. menus, according to Datassential. That's more than quadruple its menu penetration four years ago, based on the firm's data, but there's still a long runway before it reaches ubiquity.Mexican-inspired fast-food brands such as Qdoba, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco and even Taco Bell have released their own versions of birria. And there's at least 478 restaurant operators running birria-focused restaurants, according to Datassential.Mike's menu also includes burritos, loaded nachos and fries, and birria ramen.\"It appeals to a very broad range of guests — it's not just your millennials and Gen Zs,\" Phelps said, speaking about the customers in Mike's Red Tacos restaurants. \"There's older people in the restaurant, there's little kids, so it's got a very, very broad appeal.\"Phelps co-founded Wetzel's Pretzels in 1994 and became a founding investor in Blaze Pizza, the fast-casual pizza chain founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel. In 2019, Phelps joined Dave's Hot Chicken as an investor and CEO, using franchising to expand the chain quickly to hundreds of restaurants worldwide. Last year, private equity firm Roark Capital bought a majority stake in Dave's Hot Chicken in deal worth roughly $1 billion.Feghali was one of the first franchisees of Dave's Hot Chicken. He is also one of the nation's largest Little Caesars operators. Together, Feghali and Phelps founded Four Wall Partners, a restaurant franchising investment firm. In addition to being early-stage investors in Mike's, they will act as advisors and members of the chain's board. Vincent Montanelli, who most recently served as chief executive of Wetzel's, has joined Mike's to serve as president.Founded originally as a food truck five years ago, Mike's Red Tacos opened its first brick-and-mortar location in 2022. Founder Mike Touma plans to open his third location in March; he'll stay on with the company as a board member and franchisee of the chain's San Diego locations.\"We put together a deal where [Touma is] going to keep the rights to his stores and future stores in San Diego, and then we're going to franchise it across the rest of the U.S. and internationally,\" Phelps said.The new team plans to follow the established playbook used by Wetzel's and Dave's to grow Mike's Red Tacos quickly.\"We're going to be very aggressive where we grow with this, because we've seen that we can do that,\" Phelps said.The taco chain has already secured franchising development deals with multi-unit operators for more than 200 locations nationwide, from California to Texas to New England. Some of those franchised restaurants could open as soon as the end of the year.Phelps anticipates stiff competition from national chains and local taco restaurants alike. However, he said he thinks that the chain's simple menu, delicious food and an aggressive marketing strategy can help Mike's overtake rivals. \"We think this can be a winner,\" Phelps said.",

    "body": "Early renderings released by Ford Motor of its next-generation, electric pickup truck, based on its upcoming universal electric vehicle platform.Courtesy FordDETROIT — Ford Motor's $5 billion \"bet\" on its next generation of all-electric vehicles will feature a budding technology that Tesla commercialized in the U.S. on its Cybertruck, the Detroit automaker said Tuesday.The system, known as a 48-volt electrical architecture, had been discussed in the automotive industry for decades but Tesla was the first to bring it to consumers in 2023.The auto industry has historically used a 12-volt system with a lead-acid battery for all vehicles to power the car's accessories — but that's been problematic and caused recalls for many EVs. The new architecture instead uses the EV's high-voltage battery to power everything.The 48-volt system improves efficiency, allows for additional electrical bandwidth and saves weight through the reduction of wiring, officials have said. The power also can be \"stepped down\" to 12 volts, when needed, through the use of new electronic control units, or ECUs, that handle different groups of an EV's architecture.The new electrical system is one of many innovations that Ford believes will allow its next-generation EVs — starting with a $30,000 small electric pickup truck in 2027 — to compete against Tesla as well as rapidly expanding Chinese brands in global markets.\"At Ford, we took on the challenge many others have stopped doing. We're taking the fight to our competition, including the Chinese,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during an August event at a plant in Kentucky that will produce the unnamed electric pickup. \"For too long, legacy automakers played it safe.\"Read moreFarley has called it a \"Model T moment\" for the company, referring to the company's flagship vehicle that came out more than a century ago and led to the mass adoption of vehicles during the early 1900s. He's also called it a \"bet\" for Ford given the amount of changes it will make to the EVs as well as the company and its processes. Ford expects the new EVs, which will be based on a common \"Universal Electric Vehicle,\" or UEV, to have comparable costs to gas-powered vehicles through new technologies and efficiencies. Currently, the massive batteries that power EVs have made them far more expensive to produce and have been infamously unprofitable. The Detroit automaker has said the new EVs will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time.\"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" Farley said at the plant. \"Now is time to change the game once again.\"Ford CEO Jim Farley speaks at the Louisville Assembly Plant as the company shares its plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in the United States, Aug. 11, 2025.Courtesy: FordFord said those improvements, as well as price points that are more similar to gas-powered models, will lead to greater adoption of EVs. That's despite a significant slowdown in U.S. EV sales amid changes to federal support by the Trump administration as well as less-than-expected consumer adoption.U.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive. That demand plummeted to preliminary estimates of 5.8% during the fourth quarter.Those market conditions recently led Ford to announce $19.5 billion in write-downs, largely related to a pullback in EV plans, but the company said it will continue to invest $5 billion for its new UEV platform through 2027.\"Our focus has been on giving them everything they would get in a nice vehicle and more, and we think that that will allow us to ultimately not just make an affordable vehicle, but make one that's extremely desirable,\" Alan Clarke, Ford's executive director of advanced EV development, said during a media briefing.48-volt systemThe 48-volt system provides significant benefits to other parts of the vehicle aside from just the battery and is expected to continue to do so as the bandwidth of 12-volt batteries gets maxed out, according Clarke, a former Tesla executive. \"It's less expensive, has smaller wires and is the future of automotive,\" he said. \"So, if you want to future-protect this platform to exist for more than a decade … it's very clear that 48 made the most sense.\"Alan Clarke, Ford’s executive director of advanced EV development, during a video presentation on Ford's Universal Electric Vehicle platform.Courtesy FordFord said the wiring harness in the new midsize truck will be more than 4,000 feet shorter and 22 pounds lighter than the wiring harness used in Ford's first-generation electric SUV.Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent competitors such as Ford and General Motors a \"how-to\" guide on developing a 48-volt system in 2023.Clarke said Ford had already decided on a 48-volt platform before getting the letter but that it \"certainly added fuel to the fire\" and was a \"helpful starting point to see how they thought about\" it. It also helped suppliers get ready to assist with 48-volt systems, he added.GigacastingsIn addition to the 48-volt system, the company on Tuesday released additional details on how it's achieving its targets with the new EV through aerodynamics, team \"bounties\" to increase vehicle efficiency and turning to Tesla-pioneered \"gigacastings.\"Gigacasting is a manufacturing process that can replace dozens of traditionally small, stamped parts with larger pieces. The process requires massive machines to pressurize large sheets of metal into parts such as a vehicle's facia or underlying structure.A Ford F-150 Lightning next to a Tesla Cybertruck.Michael Wayland / CNBCFord said the new pickup will only have two structural front and rear parts compared with 146 such components on its current gas-powered Maverick small pickup.Ford also said its aluminum castings for the upcoming EV are more than 27% lighter than those features on a Tesla Model Y.\"We're still on a really steep decline of EV costs, and you can only get that by innovating, and you can only get that by system level, optimizing into what eventually becomes a product that a customer wants,\" Clarke said.

More than 200 million gallons of wastewater gushed into the Potomac in recent weeks. A pipe collapsed in January on the Potomac Interceptor sewage line alongside the Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland, just outside of the District of Columbia. The pipe and the sewage line are managed by DC Water, an independent utility that serves the capital area and is managing the disaster.Trump on Tuesday demanded regional Democratic leaders ask him for help in fixing the spill, seemingly backtracking after he announced on Monday that his administration would be taking over the recovery effort. \"The two Governors and the Mayor of D.C. must act, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, referring to Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat. \"If they can't do the job, they have to call me and ask, politely, to get it fixed. The Federal Government is not at all involved with what has taken place, but we can fix it.\"Trump on Monday singled out Moore in another Truth Social post on the spill, saying it is a \"result of the Gross Mismanagement of Local Democrat Leaders, particularly, Governor Wes Moore, of Maryland.\"The sewage spat comes amid a series of feuds the president is waging with state executives, especially Moore, who is seen as a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028. It's also the latest example of Trump leveraging the bully pulpit of the presidency to bludgeon his political rivals, including Moore. Moore responded in a post on X to Trump's post saying the spill is \"basically contained\" and asking the White House to instead help with emergency funding to help the state recover from flooding last year.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Wes Moore speaks on the day of President Joe Biden's visit to Dundalk Marine Terminal, in Baltimore, Maryland, Oct. 29, 2024.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersAmmar Moussa, a spokesperson for Moore, said it's Trump, not Maryland, who is responsible for the Potomac Interceptor and accused the president of shirking responsibility. \"Since the last century, the federal government has been responsible for the Potomac Interceptor, which is the origin of the sewage leak,\" Moussa said in a statement. \"Apparently the Trump administration hadn't gotten the memo that they're actually supposed to be in charge here. Where the president has failed to act, Maryland has played its part to protect residents, protect drinking water, and ensure accountability.\"Moore's office said that because the Potomac Interceptor is owned and operated by DC Water, it is a piece of federally regulated infrastructure under the oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency.The governor's office added that he would be willing to work with federal authorities if they are willing to assist with the recovery. \"If the federal government is just now showing up to take action, we will work collaboratively — as we always do — to be responsive and keep the public informed about the federal government's plan to remediate the damage,\" Moussa said. \"The Potomac isn't a talking point, and the people of the region deserve serious leadership that meets the moment.\"The White House, however, is doubling down on blaming local elected Democrats for the disaster. \"President Trump will not allow the failures of local and state Democrats to diminish the quality of life for millions of Americans,\" Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC. \"In line with the President's promise to make Washington, D.C. safe and beautiful, President Trump may be forced to step in and fix this disaster created by Democrats, whose gross mismanagement has allowed millions of gallons of raw sewage to be dumped into the Potomac River.\"A White House official speaking on condition of anonymity said Maryland is responsible for Potomac River water quality standards within its borders and for enforcing regulations requiring \"sewage system operators to report, monitor and mitigate unauthorized discharges that affect surface waters of the state.\"The sewage leak has not had an impact on drinking water in Washington, according to DC Water. The overflow was stopped in late January, and sewage is now being bypassed around the broken pipe. Due to the raw sewage released into the river, however, the district's Department of Energy and Environment has warned residents to avoid the river. The Potomac is a source of drinking water for the District of Columbia, and it's a popular location for kayaking and other recreation.The Environmental Protection Agency said it is able to support the recovery effort if it is asked to. \"At no point has DC Water or the state of Maryland requested EPA to take over their responsibilities, and EPA has continued to offer its full support to state and local leaders from the onset. We are always ready to step in and assist with our exceptional team,\" the EPA press office said in a statement to CNBC. \"The Potomac Interceptor overflow is a sewage crisis of historic proportion. Never should any American family, community, or waterway ever have to experience this level of extensive environmental damage,\" the press office said. ",

Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats are locked in negotiations with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans about imposing new restrictions on federal immigration agents in exchange for funding DHS. The agency shut down early Saturday morning after two weeks of stopgap funding ran out. The negotiations over DHS funding are heightened after federal immigration agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens during an immigration surge in Minneapolis. Democrats demanded that DHS funding be stripped from a package appropriating money for a handful of other agencies in the wake of the shootings and forced negotiations on immigration enforcement. The Trump administration has since said it would wind down the Minneapolis operation. Democrats didn't say what's in their counteroffer. Schumer's office didn't respond to an email seeking comment on details of the proposal.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinDemocrats have pushed for a ban on agents masking their faces, mandatory body cameras, a requirement for judicial warrants for immigration arrests and an end to \"roving patrols,\" among other priorities. The White House and Republicans have pushed back on the mask ban and judicial warrant requirements.The White House sent an initial counteroffer to a Democratic proposal last week. Democrats threw cold water on that, arguing it did not adequately address their concerns. Democrats have less incentive to capitulate during this latest spending standoff, especially given the limited scope of the shutdown and recent polling showing that most Americans feel Trump's immigration policy has gone too far.\"Built into this is the substantially changing politics of immigration. I think Republicans are still acting like they hold a straight flush on immigration, but they clearly are only holding a pair of threes,\" Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who has worked on the Hill and for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said in an interview.Many DHS employees are still working despite the shutdown, as much of the agency is deemed essential during a closure and parts of it are funded through last year's massive tax and spending bill. But essential employees may be forced to work without pay if the shutdown drags on for a long time.

Timothy A.clary | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration was sued Tuesday over the abrupt removal of the Pride rainbow flag last week from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City, at the site of the 1969 uprising that ignited the gay rights movement in the United States.The lawsuit, filed by a group of LGBTQ+ advocates and a Greenwich Village community group, said the federal government claimed that Department of the Interior rules bar the flying of anything but the U.S. flags, DOI flags, and the POW/MIA flags in national parks.\"In fact, the opposite is true: The policies the government says require removing the Pride flag expressly permit the [National Park Service] to fly other flags that provide historical context to national monuments — which is precisely what the NPS official Pride flag did at Stonewall for many years,\" the lawsuit says.The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan a day after a federal judge in Philadelphia ordered the National Park Service to restore an exhibit at Independence National Historical Park that contained information about the nine slaves who lived with President George Washington in the official presidential residence in Philadelphia in the 1790s. That order will remain in effect pending the outcome of the city of Philadelphia's lawsuit challenging the NPS's removal of the exhibit in January.The Pride flag had flown at the Stonewall National Monument since 2022 after a flagpole was installed there.The monument is located across from the Stonewall Inn, where a July 1969 police raid of the then-underground gay bar was resisted by patrons, and followed by days of riots and protests.\"Before the 1960s, almost everything about living authentically as a lesbian, a bisexual person or a gay man was illegal,\" the NPS page for the monument says. \"The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.People gather in protest at the Stonewall National Monument after the Trump administration had the National Park Service remove the LGBTQ+ Pride flag from the site, which is considered the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, on Feb. 10, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe new lawsuit in Manhattan federal court called the flag's removal on Feb. 9 \"a textbook example of an arbitrary and capricious act.\"\"This was no careless mistake,\" the suit says. \"The government has not removed other historical flags at other national monuments, most notably Confederate flags. Meanwhile, the assault on Stonewall is the latest example in a long line of efforts by the Trump Administration to target the LGBTQ+ community for discrimination and opprobrium.\"New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, in a Feb. 10 post on X, said, \"I am outraged by the removal of the Rainbow Pride Flag from Stonewall National Monument.\"\"New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,\" Mamdani said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Sunday said he would introduce a bill to make \"the Pride Flag a congressionally authorized symbol.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Revenue is expected to hit $2.94 billion to $2.95 billion, topping a $2.60 billion estimate.Revenue grew 15% from $2.3 billion a year ago, the company said. Net income totaled $432 million, or 61 cents per share, up from $267 million, or 38 cents per share a year ago.Palo Alto also said on Tuesday that it's buying Israeli cybersecurity startup Koi to secure AI agents as rising artificial intelligence innovation fuels more sophisticated cyberattacks. The company has bet big on AI tools, and recently launched AI agents to help customers automate certain security responses.The company is also in the midst of a significant spending spree as CEO Nikesh Arora transforms Palo Alto into a hub for all things cybersecurity. Since joining the company in 2018, he's overseen more than 20 acquisitions.Earlier this month, the Santa Clara, California-based company closed its biggest acquisition ever, paying $25 billion for Israeli identity security company CyberArk. In January, it closed the more than $3 billion purchase of cloud observability platform Chronosphere.\"We saw continued strength in platformizations, a trend that is accelerating due to AI - customers are keen to both modernize and normalize their cybersecurity stack, aligning them to our approach,\" Arora wrote in a release. Remaining performance obligations, which track the value of contracts to be delivered to customers, totaled $16 billion and topped a StreetAccount estimate of $15.78 billion.

    "body": "Andreypopov | Istock | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has identified more than 40,000 borrowers eligible for federal student loan forgiveness in January, a recent court filing revealed.More than 10,800 of the borrowers who qualified for the debt cancellation were enrolled in the U.S. Department of Education's Income-Based Repayment Plan; another over 10,700 were in the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan; and 820 borrowers were enrolled in the Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan. Those three programs are all known as income-driven repayment plans. IDRs limit a borrower's monthly bill to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years. Another 18,160 federal student loan borrowers had their debts cancelled in January through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the Education Department said in its recent court filing. Signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush, PSLF offers debt cancellation to those who've worked for 10 years at certain not-for-profit organizations or the federal government.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe January numbers suggest the Trump administration is increasing its efforts to ease the financial burden of student loan debt.Amid a barrage of recent changes to the federal lending system and sweeping layoffs at the Education Department in March, many student loan holders have struggled to access the loan-forgiveness opportunities available under their borrowing terms. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, with total outstanding debt exceeding $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.Education Department officials agreed to share status updates on the processing of student loan discharges as part of an October settlement with the American Federation of Teachers, a teachers' union representing some 1.8 million members. The AFT sued the Trump administration last year, accusing officials of denying student loan borrowers their legal rights.\"Thanks to our lawsuit, 20,000 more teachers, nurses, firefighters and public service workers finally got their debt discharged,\" said AFT president Randi Weingarten.'Golden emails' on student loan forgiveness The borrowers deemed eligible for IDR forgiveness in January have not yet had their debts discharged, Education Department officials said in the court filing. The department usually provides borrowers with a short period to opt out of the debt cancellation. \"These people should be getting their notices in February,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\"In fact, we have several clients who got the 'golden email' this month,\" Nierman said, referencing the term some borrowers use to describe the Education Department electronic message confirming their debt cancellation.Backlog remains for affordable repayment plans More than 626,000 federal student loan holders remain stuck in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department reported. Many borrowers rely on IDR plans in order to afford their monthly payments, consumer advocates say.However, the Education Department has made progress on processing the applications: Approximately 734,000 requests were pending in December, compared with nearly 1.4 million in July. However, the PSLF buyback pileup continues to grow, with more than 86,520 borrowers in the queue in January, up from 83,370 in December and 80,210 in November. The buyback option allows borrowers pursuing PSLF to retroactively pay for any months they missed because of a forbearance or deferment, accelerating their timeline to forgiveness. The Education Department said in January it had approved 1,980 buyback applications.

The exercise is designed to improve Iran's operational readiness and bolster its deterrence, among other objectives.Iran and the U.S. reached an understanding of the \"guiding principles\" during the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters after they concluded, Reuters reported. The progress does not mean an agreement will be reached soon and more work still needs to be done, he added.watch nowEnergy market participants had been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks, particularly as both sides have increased their military presence in the region.Oil prices were last seen trading lower, erasing earlier gains. International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 1.8% to $67.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery stood 0.4% lower at $62.65 Jakob Larsen, chief safety and security officer at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said the temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz was likely to cause \"minor nuisance and delays\" to inbound shipping headed for the Persian Gulf — but no major disruptions.\"The exercise establishes a live firing exercise area overlapping the inbound part of Strait of Hormuz's Traffic Separation Scheme, and requests that shipping keeps clear of the area for the duration of a few hours,\" Larsen said.\"Given the level of tension in the area, it is expected that commercial shipping will comply with the Iranian request to keep clear of the exercise area,\" he added.— CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco and Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.",

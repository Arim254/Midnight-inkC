    "body": "Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe could personally earn up to $4.6 billion over the next decade if the electric automaker hits specific profit and share price targets laid out in a new compensation package recently approved by his company's board of directors.The potential payout, which is earning comparisons to Elon Musk's Tesla pay plan, likely never would have been possible had the 42-year-old Rivian founder — and his father — not made a \"financially highly irrational\" decision. In 2009, they took out a pair of second mortgages to secure the money needed to get the company off the ground.Scaringe has said that he formed Rivian, initially named Mainstream Motors, the day after he earned his PhD in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in June 2009. He dreamed of starting an automotive business since childhood, when he helped a neighbor restore classic cars, and researched lower-emission combustion ignition engines as part of his PhD program at MIT's Sloan Automative Lab. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossHis first business project: building a hybrid sports car. But he lacked enough funding to launch a capital-intensive business: A car company can require \"billions of dollars ... thousands of engineers [and] a manufacturing plant that would take years to build,\" Scaringe said in an October 2024 interview at his undergraduate alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Scaringe had no employees at the time, and hadn't yet designed or built any of his proposed vehicle's underlying infrastructure or technology — so investors weren't eager to supply funding, he said.\"It's this incredibly high-risk proposition. So, because of that, my dad and I actually financed the beginning [of Rivian]. I had a house that I refinanced [and] my dad had a house that he refinanced,\" said Scaringe, adding: \"His love for me and belief in me led him to do something that was financially highly irrational…If it were not for that, it would have been impossible to get going.\" Both refinancings were second mortgages, The New York Times reported in July 2019.Scaringe initially bought his own home in high school with money he'd saved from two summer jobs — working in a restaurant and also as an apprentice machinist — and then earned extra income renting the home, he told the \"How I Built This\" podcast in a September 2022 episode.From sports cars to electric trucks and SUVsThe Rivian founder hasn't publicly disclosed how much money he secured from the two refinancings, but the funds were enough — along with some investments from \"friends and family\" — to begin hiring Rivian's first engineers and start building a prototype vehicle, he said on \"How I Built This.\"The company also rented a warehouse from Scaringe's dad, an engineer and founder of Rockledge, Florida-based Mainstream Engineering Corporation, which makes a range of HVAC and refrigeration products.Scaringe hired roughly 15 engineers and designed a four-seat, sports coupe that he hoped to eventually sell to prospective customers for around $25,000, he told the Orlando Sentinel in May 2010. After two years of development, he shelved the prototype, aiming instead to build something that could have a bigger impact on the auto industry, he told \"How I Built This.\"\"The thought of going out and building what Tesla had already done [with the electric Tesla Roadster] ... just felt like that wasn't a problem that the world needed [to be] worked on,\" Scaringe said.Scaringe went back to the drawing board, which he called one of the \"most perplexing and challenging times\" of his life. He was drawn to the challenge of building all-electric pickups and SUVs, he said — popular vehicle categories that produce more emissions than smaller cars when powered by gas engines.In 2012, Rivian raised more than $1 million in funding, led by Saudi Arabian auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel. Scaringe met the chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, a fellow MIT alum, through the school's alumni network and successfully pitched him on his vision for Rivian, he told \"How I Built This.\" Rivian ultimately raised $10.5 billion in funding from the likes of Amazon and Ford before going public in 2021, the same year the company's electric trucks and SUVs finally hit the market.Today, Rivian has a market value of more than $20 billion, with Scaringe owning a stake of about 1.4% in the company, according to Forbes. If Rivian hits all of the profit and share price targets in Scaringe's pay package over the next decade, its market value could increase by roughly $153 billion and Scaringe would accrue a larger stake in his business, the company said in a Nov. 7 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "A worker inspects the outdoor gas pipes at the underground gas storage facility operated by Gas Storage CZ AS, in Haje, Czech Republic, on Friday, Jan. 3, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe International Energy Agency's latest outlook signals that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century, reflecting a sharp tonal shift from the world's energy watchdog and raising further questions about the future of fossil fuels.In its flagship World Energy Outlook, the Paris-based agency on Wednesday laid out a scenario in which demand for oil climbs to 113 million barrels per day by 2050, up 13% from 2024 levels.The IEA had previously estimated a peak in global fossil fuel demand before the end of this decade and said that, in order to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, there should be no new investments in coal, oil and gas projects.The concept of peak oil refers to the point at which global crude production reaches its highest point, before subsequently entering an irreversible decline.The IEA's end-of-decade peak oil forecast kick-started a long-running war of words with OPEC, an influential group of oil exporting countries, which accused the IEA of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, meanwhile, labeled the IEA's peak oil demand assumption as \"nonsensical.\"The IEA's latest forecast of increasing oil demand was outlined in its \"Current Policies Scenario\" — one of a number of scenarios outlined by the IEA. This one assumes no new policies or regulations beyond those already in place.The CPS was dropped five years ago amid energy market turmoil during the coronavirus pandemic, and its reintroduction follows pressure from the Trump administration.Earlier this month, the IEA said that now that the world has passed through the pandemic and global energy crisis, \"there is merit in revisiting the CPS.\"The agency said increasing oil demand would be primarily driven by demand for petrochemical products and jet fuel, alongside a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicles.Read moreGregory Brew, an analyst at Eurasia Group's Energy, Climate and Resources team, said the IEA's retreat on peak oil demand signified \"a major shift\" from the group's position over the last five years.\"The justifications offered for the shift include policy changes in the U.S., where slow EV penetration indicates robust oil [consumption], but is also tied to expected increases in petrochemical and aviation fuel in East and Southeast Asia,\" Brew told CNBC by email.\"It's unlikely the agency is adjusting based on political pressure — though there has been some of that, with the Trump administration criticizing the group's supposed bias in favor of renewable energy — and the shift reflects a broader skepticism that oil demand is set to peak any time soon,\" he added.A misguided notion?In an apparent thawing of tensions between two major players in the energy industry, OPEC welcomed what it described as the IEA's \"rendezvous with reality.\"In a statement published on its website, OPEC said: \"We hope that the IEA's World Energy Outlook represents a return to the fold of analysis grounded in energy realities and that we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of 'peak oil.'\"Alongside its CPS, the IEA also laid out projections under its so-called \"Stated Policies Scenario\" (STEPS), which reflects the prevailing direction of travel for the global energy system.In this assumption, the IEA said it expects oil demand to peak at 102 million barrels per day around 2030, before gradually declining. Global electric car sales are much stronger under this scenario compared to the CPS.The IEA said its multiple scenarios explore a range of consequences from various policy choices and should not be considered forecasts.Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), at the World Nuclear Exhibition (WNE) conference in Paris, France, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. The conference gathers key figures of the international nuclear sector from Nov. 4-6.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGrant Hauber, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said the IEA's CPS appears to be the U.S. administration \"capitulation\" scenario, which sees some sort of flattening of current energy market trends.\"This leads to what almost appears to be a false dawn of LNG demand that could provide encouragement to those investing in the U.S. LNG export boom. CPS 'creates' enough global LNG demand to justify build-outs through 2035,\" Hauber said.\"However, one only need look at the STEPS scenario to see how fragile that outlook is. Demand-Supply matching evaporates quickly over that same timeframe leading to LNG surplus. This occurs even with STEPS' more moderated additions of renewables, efficiency and electrification measures,\" he added.Climate crisisIn all of the IEA's scenarios, the energy watchdog predicted that global temperatures will rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.Scientists have repeatedly warned that global average temperatures must not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or potentially irreversible changes to some of Earth's largest systems.Extreme temperatures are fueled by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels.Lars Nitter Havro, head of energy macro at Rystad Energy, said the IEA's reintroduction of its CPS represents \"a tonal shift,\" but shouldn't necessarily be seen as a \"wholesale reversal\" on peak oil.",

    "body": "Under the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple is required to allow developers to freely inform customers of alternative offers outside its App Store.Gabby Jones | Bloomberg via Getty ImagesApple on Thursday said it would cut the company's App Store fees from 30% to 15% for some app makers, if they enter into a new program administered by the iPhone maker.The Mini Apps Partner Program offers app developers the better fee in exchange for using some of Apple's technology to build their apps. This includes using Apple software to register a user's purchase history, verify user ages and to process in-app purchases.A \"mini app\" is a lightweight piece of software inside a third-party app store, like that of Discord's. These apps uses are built using web technology like HTML or Javascript.Most notably, China's WeChat offers offers millions of mini-apps built by other developers to let users track packages, look up transit directions and shop online. Artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI are increasingly integrating mini apps inside their chatbots.The move is Apple's latest effort to evolve its App Store. The company has been under pressure from regulators in Europe and court decisions in the U.S. to give up control over its App Store and reduce its fees. In most countries, the Apple App Store is the only way to install software on an iPhone.In recent years, the company has offered several similar programs for video apps, news apps and small app developers that cut the iPhone maker's fees in exchange for developers choosing deeper integration and participation in Apple's ecosystem.Apple has argued that both developers and users are better off when using its technology and rules, instead of eschewing them to try to avoid fees.\"This program is designed to help developers who host mini apps grow their business and further the availability of mini apps on the App Store — all while providing a great customer experience,\" the company said in its announcement.Although Apple has banned others from offering their own app stores on its platform, it has been embracing mini apps in recent years. Last year, it allowed mini-apps to start charging for in-app purchases using Apple's software for digital goods like in-game currency or lives in a video game.All iPhone developers submit their apps to Apple, which reviews the submission using humans before making the software available for download on the App Store.Participants in the new program will still have to provide Apple with information for each specific mini-app experience they offer.WATCH: Investors view Apple's capital discipline as a strategic advantage, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

The measure was passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday night in a 222-209 vote.\"Republicans never wanted a shutdown,\" Trump said. \"People were hurt so badly.\" He noted that more than 1 million federal workers were furloughed.During the shutdown, key economic reports were delayed including the consumer price index, producer price index, and the non farm payrolls report.These reports may never be released, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday.\"The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal Statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released,\" Leavitt said. \"All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed, flying blind at a critical period.\"",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI has raised $15 billion from investors, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.Musk later called the news \"False\" in a post on his social media platform X.The funding adds another $5 billion to the $10 billion round CNBC reported on in September, which valued the startup at $200 billion. Sources told CNBC that a lot of the money will fund graphic processing units that underpin large language models.Artificial intelligence startups have reached sky high valuations in recent months as they raise massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for foundational models.In September, AI startup Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round that roughly tripled its valuation from March. Sam Altman's OpenAI in October closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation. Last month, Reuters reported that the ChatGPT maker was prepping for an IPO that could value it at $1 trillion.Musk's AI venture has repeatedly stirred controversy, including with its rapid build-out of large, power-hungry data centers in Memphis. The data centers have used natural gas-burning turbines as a power source, emissions from which contribute to air quality problems in the area, according to local researchers.Read more CNBC tech newsAnthropic to spend $50 billion on U.S. AI infrastructure, starting with Texas, New York data centersAMD CEO Lisa Su calls AI spending 'the right gamble' as stock soars on strong growth projectionsAI startup Code Metal is going beyond vibe coding with the help of $36 million in fresh capitalCisco's stock jumps on earnings beat, strong guidance and $1.3 billion in AI ordersXAI also makes a chatbot called Grok, and recently launched a site called Grokipedia, which is meant to be an online encyclopedia to rival Wikipedia. Both Grok and Grokipedia have drawn widespread criticism for generating and spreading false content, and in some cases, anti-semitic and other hate speech.XAI acquired social network X this March in an all-stock transaction in a deal that valued the platform at $33 billion.Musk's automaker Tesla also does business with xAI. Newer Tesla vehicles feature Grok in their infotainment systems. Meanwhile, xAI has purchased tens of millions of dollars worth of Tesla's battery energy storage systems for use at their data centers in Memphis.Tesla held their annual shareholder meeting and proxy vote last week. Investors voted to approve a CEO pay plan for Musk that could net him around $1 trillion in Tesla shares over the next decade depending on what milestones the company achieves.Also up for a proxy vote was a shareholder proposal to allow Tesla to invest in xAI. There were not enough votes in favor of an xAI investment for the Tesla board to move ahead with any deal.At the annual meeting, Brandon Ehrhart, who is general counsel and corporate secretary at Tesla, said the company is \"considering next steps on the issue.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump signs funding legislation to reopen the federal government as he is joined by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Minority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), Republican lawmakers and business leaders, during a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 12, 2025, in Washington, DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump late Wednesday signed into law a funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.The measure, which will fund government operations through the end of January, was passed by the House of Representatives earlier Wednesday night in a 222-209 vote.\"The Democrats tried to extort our country,\" Trump said before signing the bill in the Oval Office at the White House to reopen the government after 43 days.Democrats had blocked passage of a funding bill until Sunday, when a bloc of the party's Senate caucus agreed to support a new funding measure in that chamber, despite it not including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits.\"Republicans never wanted a shutdown,\" said the president, who was flanked by GOP leaders of Congress, as well as by business leaders such as Ken Griffin of Citadel, John Paulson, and Masa Son, CEO of SoftBank.\"People were hurt so badly,\" Trump said, noting the more than 1 million federal workers furloughed, and the effect on government services for Americans. \"We can never let this happen again.\"He reiterated his call for the Senate to end a filibuster rule that effectively requires 60 votes to pass legislation, including short-term funding resolutions.Trump did not take questions from reporters after the signing, despite several of them trying to ask about the release by House Democrats earlier in the day of documents from the estate of his former friend, Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious sex offender. He was asked about, but ignored, a question about emails by Epstein referring to him.Trump has denied knowing about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were friends.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., before Wednesday's vote, in comments backing the bill on the chamber's floor, said, \"My friends, let's get this done.\"U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) holds a news conference after the House passed funding legislation to reopen the federal government, at the Capitol on Nov. 12, 2025 in Washington, DC.Tom Brenner | Getty ImagesJust two Republicans in the House voted against the bill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Florida's Greg Steube.All but six Democrats voted against the bill: Adam Gray of California; Maine's Jared Golden; Tom Suozzi of New York; Washington's Marie Gluesenkamp Perez; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Henry Cuellar of Texas.The Office of Management and Budget told federal employees to return to their jobs on Thursday.Earlier Wednesday night, the U.S. Department of Transportation froze the level of flight cuts it imposed in light of shortages of air traffic controllers during the shutdown.As of Tuesday, 6% of scheduled flights were canceled at U.S. airports, and that level was set to rise to 10% by Friday.The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and government operations had remained shuttered since then because Senate Democrats overwhelmingly refused to vote for a funding measure that did not extend the boosted ACA subsidies, which reduce the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for 20 million Americans.The Senate passed the funding bill on Monday night, a day after the Republican majority won support for it from seven Democrats and one independent senator to barely reach the 60-vote minimum.Under the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to allow Democrats a vote in December on a bill of their choice to extend those boosted subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of that month.In addition to short-term funding, the deal will also reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal government employees and ensure that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries that they would have received if the government had not shut down.It is not yet known when all federal employees will be paid, but agencies are expected to roughly follow the timeline for paying House staffers, who are set to receive checks on Tuesday.The package also funds the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps. An EBT sign is displayed on the window of a grocery store on Oct. 30, 2025 in the Flatbush neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration tried to end those food stamp benefits in November, citing the shutdown, and then refused to tap money other than $4.6 billion in a congressionally appropriated contingency fund to fully pay SNAP benefits for the month.The Supreme Court had stayed a federal judge's order mandating that full benefits be paid until Thursday, giving Congress time to effectively moot the case by passing the shutdown bill.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., during remarks on the House floor before the vote, said some people will see their monthly insurance premiums \"double or even triple\" because of the lack of protection for the added ACA subsidies.She said, \"more than 2 million Americans are expected to lose their health plans next year because it is just too expensive.\"DeLauro said that Johnson, the House speaker, \"has shown no interest\" in holding a vote on the ACA subsidies, despite Senate Republicans saying that was the plan.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said, \"We never should have been here.\"\"We tried as Republicans more than a month ago to prevent a government shutdown,\" Scalise said.\"We waited for 42 days where time and time again, Democrats, to appease their most radical base, voted to keep that government shut down.\"Scalise said \"millions of Americans\" have had to endure \"pain and suffering\" because Democrats refused to vote for a funding bill.He accused Democrats of hypocrisy by seeking $200 billion in health spending that would benefit \"illegals,\" while \"advocating to gut the $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund.\"\"It's insanity,\" Scalise said.",

    "body": "fstop123 | E+ | Getty ImagesForeclosure filings climbed again in October, after sitting at historic lows in recent years, according to new data released Thursday.While the numbers are still small, the persistent rise in foreclosures may be a sign of cracks in the housing market.There were 36,766 U.S. properties with some type of foreclosure filing in October — such as default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions, according to Attom, a property data and analytics firm. That was 3% higher than September and a 19% jump from October 2024, and marked the eighth straight month of annual increases, Attom said.Foreclosure starts, which are the initial phase of the process, rose 6% for the month and were 20% higher than the year before. Competed foreclosures, the final phase, jumped 32% year over year.\"Even with these increases, activity remains well below historic highs. The current trend appears to reflect a gradual normalization in foreclosure volumes as market conditions adjust and some homeowners continue to navigate higher housing and borrowing costs,\" said Attom CEO Rob Barber in a release.Florida, South Carolina and Illinois led the nation in state foreclosure filings. On a metropolitan area level, Florida's Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando had the most filings, with Riverside, California, and Cleveland rounding out the top five.Looking specifically at completed foreclosures, Texas, California and Florida had the most, suggesting those states will see more inventory coming on the market at distressed prices. There is still very strong demand for homes, especially in lower price ranges, so it is likely those foreclosed properties will find buyers quickly.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.At the peak of the Great Recession, more than 4% of mortgages were in foreclosure, according to Rick Sharga, CEO of CJ Patrick Co., a real estate market intelligence firm. Today, less than 0.5% are in foreclosure, well below the historic average of between 1% and 1.5%. In addition, 4% of mortgages are delinquent; at the peak of the financial crisis, almost 12% were.\"So, no foreclosure tsunami to worry about,\" said Sharga. \"That said, there are a few areas of concern. [Federal Housing Administration] delinquencies are over 11%, and account for 52% of all seriously delinquent loans; we're likely to see more FHA loans in foreclosure in 2026.\"He also noted that states where home prices have been falling while insurance premiums have been soaring — Florida and Texas, in particular — are seeing an uptick in defaults. While home prices nationally are easing, they remain stubbornly high. Meanwhile, mortgage rates, which were expected to fall more sharply after the Federal Reserve started to cut rates, are still within a percentage point of their recent highs. Some recent buyers who thought they might have been able to refinance to lower rates by now may be feeling pressure, especially with still stubborn inflation.Consumer debt is at an all-time high, delinquencies are rising in other types of consumer credit and the job market appears to be weakening — all of which could contribute to cracks in the housing market.\"None of these issues have impacted mortgage performance - yet, but it would be unrealistic to assume that these trends, along with slow home sales and declining home price appreciation, won't lead to at least a slight increase in delinquencies and defaults in the months ahead,\" added Sharga.",

    "body": "watch nowThe hemp industry is bracing for layoffs, production reductions and billions in lost revenue after Congress passed a government funding bill late Wednesday containing a surprise provision that will ban nearly all hemp-derived consumer products.Hemp, a derivative of the cannabis plant, was legalized in the 2018 Farm Bill for industrial uses like rope, textiles and seed. But the law's broad definition created a loophole in federal rules on THC — the psychoactive compound responsible for a high — experts said, allowing producers to extract psychoactive cannabinoids from federally legal hemp. Companies used that opening to flood the market with gummies, drinks and vapes capable of delivering a marijuana-like high.The new ban, tucked into legislation ending the longest shutdown in history, outlaws products containing more than 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container. Industry executives said that threshold will wipe out 95% of the $28 billion hemp retail market when it takes effect in a year.For reference, a single hemp gummy typically contains 2.5 to 10 milligrams of THC, according to the Journal of Cannabis Research.\"We have lost the battle this time,\" said Jonathan Miller, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable's general counsel. \"In effect, this is a total, all out, complete ban on hemp products in the United States.\"Cannabis beer and other cannabis-infused drinks will be available at a stand at the \"Mary Jane\" hemp trade fair. Monika Skolimowska | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesThe new cap replaces the 2018 Farm Bill's definition of hemp, which was based on THC concentration and allowed products with less than 0.3% THC by weight instead of total amount.\"We have a year to figure this out but in the meantime you could see losses across the industry if we can't,\" Miller said.More than 300,000 jobs tied to the hemp economy are at risk, according to Whitney Economics, a hemp and cannabis research firm, from farmers and extractors to manufacturers, logistics firms and retailers.The ripple effects could hit land use, contracted acreage and equipment financing, as farmers who scaled up hemp cultivation after 2018 could suddenly face canceled or restructured contracts, said Michael Gorenstein, CEO of marijuana producer Cronos Group. States with the biggest hemp infrastructure like Kentucky, Texas and Utah are likely to face the steepest economic fallout, hemp executives said.\"There's a lot of the small retailers, small businesses and farmers that are relying on hemp sales to survive,\" Gorenstein told CNBC. \"It's going to create a lot of pressure when they start losing business, losing jobs and losing crops.\"The crackdown marks a dramatic reversal from 2018 when Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., championed hemp legalization to create a new national agricultural commodity and economic driver for Kentucky.But after that bill passed, the absence of federal rules allowed a patchwork market to emerge, with widespread safety issues from mislabeled and untested products to items with potency rivaling recreational marijuana, according to government officials and industry experts.McConnell and other Republicans argued the new restriction \"restores the original intent\" of the Farm Bill. Closing the loophole, McConnell has said, is key to protecting his agriculture-policy legacy before his retirement next year.\"This was his [McConnell's] signature law, the hemp law, and he wanted to correct it,\" Boris Jordan, CEO of cannabis company Curaleaf, told CNBC. \"Usually the Senate will back a retiring senator, particularly someone as senior as him, as their last action. This was a request by him at the last minute.\"But not all Republicans agree. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has sparred with his colleagues for months over hemp and blasted the provision as an overreach that is \"killing jobs and crushing farmers,\" adding that \"every hemp seed in the country will have to be destroyed.\"\"This is the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I've seen in a long, long time,\" Paul said after the ban was passed.In this July 5, 2018 photo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell inspects a piece of hemp taken from a bale of hemp at a processing plant in Louisville, Ky. McConnell led the push in Congress to legalize hemp.AP Photo | Bruce SchreinerWhile leaders like Jordan said the legal market will sharply contract from a ban, they caution the consumer demand for hemp-derived THC will not. Studies have shown demand for marijuana and other THC-based products has continued rising in recent years as some consumers move away from alcohol and drink less overall.Cannabis executives warned that rising popularity could drive billions in black-market sales, where products face no testing, no age restrictions and no tax compliance.\"What this ban is going to do is it's going to force all those little players right now into the illegal market,\" Jordan said. \"Companies have got way too much money invested in this and the demand is still there and growing. They [companies] aren't just going to go away, they're just going to go into the illicit market and put more people at risk.\"And as products move underground, law enforcement agencies could struggle to trace supply chains, Gorenstein said.\"Bad actors thrive when things disappear from the formal economy,\" Gorenstein said.State and local governments could also lose out on millions in tax revenue tied to hemp sales, Gorenstein and Miller said. Several states use those funds to support addiction services, county budgets and public health programs.Moving forward, industry leaders argue the only durable solution is federal standards, not prohibition. Many favor a model splitting responsibility between agencies: the Food and Drug Administration for oversight for product safety and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for taxation and distribution.Executives have also compared the current environment to the early e-cigarette boom, when products like Juul offered fruity and candy-like cartridges that spread quickly, with uneven oversight, before the FDA intervened.\"Too many people have taken liberties that put the end user at risk,\" cannabis company Verano Holdings CEO George Archos told CNBC. \"We like the tight regulation. We want the safety of the consumer being set in mind for every product that's being produced and that's what we hope is being accomplished.\"In the meantime, the industry is preparing a full-court lobbying push aimed at replacing the ban with federal testing, labeling and age-restriction rules.\"We already have members of Congress introducing regulation bills. We are pledging our support and we are working on the grassroots to get citizens activated around the issue,\" Miller said. \"We are activating across the sector.\"Simultaneously, the Trump administration is \"looking at\" reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I drug — alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III drug. The move would not legalize recreational marijuana, but it would make it easier to sell, advocates said.\"Big changes are expected across the board next year but what they will be could determine the future of investments and the industry,\" Gorenstein said.",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk speaks at a Q&amp;A following a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | ReutersTwo months ago, Oracle's stock had its best day since 1992, soaring 36% to a record after the company blew away investors with its forecast for cloud infrastructure revenue.Since then, the company has lost one-third of its value, more than wiping out those gains. Midway through November, the stock is on pace for its worst month since 2011.The hype was sparked by Oracle's strengthening ties to OpenAI. But the mood of late has turned, with investors questioning whether the AI market ran too far, too fast and whether OpenAI can live up to its $300 billion commitment to Oracle over five years.\"AI sentiment is waning,\" said Jackson Ader, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in an interview.Ader said that of the big cloud companies in the GPU business, Oracle is expected to generate the least amount of free cash flow. To fund the capex required for Oracle's business, Ader expects Oracle to turn to more creative financing tools.Oracle is looking to raise $38 billion in debt sales to help fund its AI buildout, according to sources with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is confidential. Bloomberg reported on the planned debt raise last month.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’The company needs a massive pool of capital as it works with partners to develop and lease data centers across Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin, while also buying hundreds of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to run AI models.At Oracle's big annual conference in October, called AI World, tech enthusiasts cheered the company's cloud infrastructure design as being easily scalable. Investors remained largely enthusiastic at the time, thanks to Oracle's over $450 billion in signed contracts that hadn't yet been recognized as revenue.Skepticism started to hit shortly after the conference. Oracle shares fell 7% on Oct. 17, as investors questioned the company's ability to reach its lofty outlook announced at its investor day. Oracle said it expected to reach $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $18 billion in fiscal 2026. Oracle's next quarterly earnings report is expected in mid-December.Andrew Keches, an analyst at Barclays, said off-balance sheet debt facilities and vendor financing are two options for Oracle. Keches recently downgraded Oracle's debt, citing the company's \"significant funding needs.\"\"We struggle to see an avenue for ORCL's credit trajectory to improve,\" Keches wrote in a note to clients this week.Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison during a launch event at the company's headquarters in Redwood Shores, California June 10, 2014.Noah Berger | ReutersOracle bulls point to founder Larry Ellison's long and storied track record. A hedge fund manager who asked to remain anonymous told CNBC that Ellison is \"someone you don't want to bet against.\"And Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview that Oracle could rebuild its momentum in the market with more AI deals. However, Jaluria currently has a hold rating on the stock. As more investors look to hedge their bets, Oracle's 5-year credit default swaps have climbed to a 2-year high, a level that's not alarming but worth watching, credit analysts told CNBC. Credit default swaps are like insurance for investors, with buyers paying for protection in case the borrower can't repay its debt.Barclays recommended clients buy Oracle's 5-year credit default swaps.Oracle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, CNBC's David Faber asked Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two CEOs, whether OpenAI will be able to pay Oracle $60 billion a year. Magouyrk responded, \"of course,\" while also pointing to OpenAI's growth prospects and rapid rise in users.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X last week that the company will top $20 billion in annualized revenue this year and reach hundreds of billions of dollars by 2030. Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Wednesday that Oracle represents the \"bad behavior in the AI buildout.\" He contrasted Oracle with Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which he said all have the available cash and customer demand to justify their rapid expansions.For Oracle, however, there's an overreliance on OpenAI, a cash-burning startup, Luria said. Additionally, he said that gross margins for renting out GPUs are dramatically lower than the roughly 80% margin in the company's core business. Luria has a hold rating on the stock. In terms of the $100 of stock appreciation that initially followed the last earnings report, \"it makes a lot of sense that that's completely gone away,\" Luria said.

Chairman Paul Sciarra told CNBC that the flight showcases Joby's ability to quicky move from \"concept to demonstration\" to meet growing military needs.Joby and L3Harris first said they were collaborating on a military craft with autonomous or piloted capabilities in August.The U.S. government is investing aggressively under the Trump Administration on new autonomous, artificial intelligence and defense technology to improve the military's capabilities. The president has also outlined plans for a $175 billion \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.\"The defense landscape is really changing,\" Sciarra said, adding that it's playing out in conflicts like the war between Russia and Ukraine, \"where commercial technologies are being rapidly deployed.\"Joby, which is widely known for its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts, or eVTOLs, is currently racing to get certified by Federal Aviation Administration to start flying commercially. The company's stock price has doubled this year.Joby is betting big on Saudi Arabia as a major testing ground for its technology, signing an agreement this week to bring its air taxis to the Middle Eastern country.  The company is also working with the United Arab Emirates. The market has gotten a boost from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in June to create an eVTOL pilot program.Archer Aviation, which was named the official air taxi provider for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, has seen its stock surge 86% over the last year and Amazon-backed Beta Technologies debuted on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.Sciarra said the aircrafts developed with L3Harris are currently geared toward defense companies, but commercial customers could benefit from the technology as Joby builds and tests it.\"We think there is great opportunity for a hybrid version of this aircraft in the commercial context that can compete with single aisle regional transport today,\" he said.Joby plans to let government agencies and departments start testing the vehicles next year.WATCH: Joby to acquire Blade's passenger businesswatch now",

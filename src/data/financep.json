    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently opened up about his phone habits at work, including never reading text messages and having his phone notifications turned off.\"I don't have notifications,\" the finance boss told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview. \"If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.\"He added: \"The only notifications I get is from my kids. That's it. When they text me, I get that.\"The 69-year-old revealed that he doesn't carry his phone around with him all the time and prioritizes deep focus at work.\"When I'm walking around the building and going to meetings, I don't have it on me. It's in my office,\" he said. \"When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I'm 100% focused on us, what you're talking about, why you're talking about it, as opposed to I'm distracted and I'm thinking about other things.\"Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is \"disrespectful\" and \"wastes time.\"\"If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,\" he said at the time.He explained that meetings should have a purpose and that checking emails and getting distracted are red flags.Working from homeDimon has remained critical of some of the newest shifts in the workplake brought about by the youngest generation at work: Gen Z. Dimon has adhered to more traditional ways of working, often expecting his employees to do the same.Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week.Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the \"damage\" that work from home was doing to younger recruits.\"Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of ... I've had it with this kind of stuff,\" he said in the recording.\"They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company.\"He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. \"And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does,\" he added.Work etiquetteAnastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. A 2023 survey by Reviews.org found that Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day.She explained that even just a having a phone near you can be extremely distracting. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette.\"I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name,\" Dedyukhina said.That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable. This includes asking follow up questions and paraphrasing and repeating what the other person said back to them.",

    "body": "Kai Yang Chan (left) and JiaYi Zhou (right) run Singapore-based bakery Cake Inspiration.Courtesy of Cake InspirationWhen Kai Yang Chan and Jiayi Zhuo matched on Tinder at age 19, neither of them expected that it would lead to marriage. Six years later, not only have they tied the knot — they're also business partners.\"I downloaded Tinder because I was very bored in school, so I was just [swiping] through during class,\" said Zhuo. \"Both of us — we didn't expect that we'd get together,\" she said.\"Personality wise, we are quite different,\" she said, adding that while she is more introverted, her husband is the life of the party.Today, Chan and Zhuo run Singapore-based bakery CakeInspiration. Their business brought in over 850,000 Singapore dollars (about $650,000) in 2024, and is on track to surpass $775,000 in revenue this year, according to documentation reviewed by CNBC Make It.The company is known for its custom cake designs, and its clientele includes family offices, hospitals and even global celebrities.A family affairCakeInspiration originally began as a home-based bakery in 2010, run by Zhuo's parents.\"My parents actually started [the business] when I was nine,\" said Zhuo. \"I was never very studious, but I really like being hands on. So I like to bake, I like to dance. I like to create all these little pretty things,\" she said. From the early days of the business, she often helped with designing cakes.Then, when the pandemic hit, sales stalled and the business began to burn through cash to stay afloat. With her parents contemplating retirement, Zhuo knew it was time for her to step in.Courtesy of CakeInspiration\"I [felt] that it's a waste to just let it go. I [saw] my parents work like 16 hours a day growing up, so ... I [didn't] want the business to get shut down,\" she said.In 2020, Zhuo officially joined her parent's business and expanded the company's product range. She eventually introduced two new brands — Eggyi.Co, which sells bento cakes, or mini, single-serving sized cakes targeted at Gen-Z, and Petissier which sells customised cakes for pets.The introduction of these two brands ultimately helped to save the family's business through Covid, said Zhuo. Today, their prices range from about $100 to $10,000 per order, and they have a staff of about 14 people across two kitchens — one for human cakes, and one for pet cakes.Shooting for the starsSimilar to Zhuo, Chan's passions lied outside of academics growing up.\"I wasn't really the most studious person, [but] I always loved the idea of entrepreneurship and doing our own thing,\" said Chan. \"Since I was 16, I did my own little startups, selling whatever. [I sold] sneakers, I'd buy them, clean them up and sell them. You know, whatever that can make money, I'll do it,\" he said.In 2022, he decided to join his wife in the family business full-time. He introduced a new strategy: rather than only selling directly to individual consumers (B2C), he suggested trying to sell to other businesses (B2B) to create a more consistent source of revenue.In addition, he was focused on building the company's brands online. Along with working to build a presence across social media platforms, Chan started targeting celebrities and influencers who came into town.A custom made cake for social media influencers, the Ha Sisters, by CakeInspiration.Courtesy of CakeInspirationIn June, three Korean-American content creators — sisters Evelyn, Erica and Emily Ha — were in Singapore for a beauty store pop-up event. When Chan discovered they were in town, he saw an opportunity to surprise them with a cake.\"It's actually quite crazy, because they were in Singapore for this beauty store pop-up... They posted a story of them in a hotel, and I thought: 'Hey, this looks really familiar. I know [which] hotel this is,'\" he said. \"So I just prepared a cake and then we just zoomed down to the hotel.\"Chan and his team quickly made a custom cake for the sisters and timed the delivery to coincide with the end of the Ha sisters' event. \"Of course, after the pop-up, you have to go back to [the hotel to] change, right? Yeah. So [that's when I] went there,\" he said.By chance, his timing was perfect. Just as he arrived at the hotel entrance with the cake in hand, he ran into the sisters — and managed to hand-deliver the surprise. One of the Ha sisters later shared a video of the cake to social media, which ultimately reached over 500,000 views.This interaction kicked off the company's celebrity marketing strategy. To date, CakeInspiration has also delivered custom cakes to K-Pop band BlackPink's Lisa, Russell Simmons, G-Dragon and more.Despite popular advice to avoid working with your partner, for Chan and Zhuo, working together as a couple has actually been a big advantage. While Chan is best at partnerships, marketing and anything external-facing, Zhuo is best at managing day-to-day operations and all things internal.\"We don't have conflicts about work because our roles are very defined ... So usually I don't tell her how to run things inside, and she doesn't really tell me how to run things outside. I guess we trust each other to fulfill our roles to the best of our abilities,\" said Chan.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "In 2020, Anita Kinoshita, 28 years old at the time, started looking into buying a house.Kinoshita was living in California and making around $70,000 a year as a software engineer for the Department of Defense.As a first-generation American from a farming family in Mexico, Kinoshita believed the best way to finally achieve the American dream her family had for her was to own property.\"I had my first big girl job and thought the next responsible thing to do would be to buy a house,\" Kinoshita tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't necessarily want to buy a house. In fact, I was trying to figure out how to finesse the purchase.\"Initially, Kinoshita was seeking a property with the intent to sublet some of the bedrooms and lower her share of the expenses. She had about $20,000 saved for a down payment.\"My vision for the future was to be able to have a family and spend as much time with them and not necessarily have an office job. [But] I still went forward with what made sense for this American Dream path,\" she says.\"I was 28 at the time, so I still kind of cared what my community defined as successful, and homeownership was part of that. At the time, I thought it was the responsible thing to do.\"Kinoshita always believed achieving the American Dream meant owning property.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita wanted to learn as much as she could about the home-buying journey she was embarking on. She enrolled in a nine-week course that teaches people how to manage their money, offered by Financial Peace University.During the retirement module of the online class, Kinoshita used a retirement calculator that helped her realize that if she started contributing a bit more to her 401(k), she could retire around age 55 and buy a house at the same time.\"All of a sudden, the vision I had for the future and the freedom and lifestyle I wanted became possible in my mind for the first time,\" she says.For two years, Kinoshita looked at least a dozen places and put in a total of four offers. She got accepted for one, but then the sellers backed out. She was also approved for a single-family home, but there was a mismatch in the appraisal, so she walked away from the deal.\"I ended up backing out because the only way to be competitive during that time was to invest less and save more for the down payment, and I wasn't willing to do that,\" she says.\"Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't the time for me at the moment, and I was not willing to invest less either. I wasn't satisfied with my career and felt like I was living my dad's dream and not really mine.\"Kinoshita viewed a dozen properties and put in a total of four offers.Anita KinoshitaRedefining successKinoshita switched her focus. Instead of saving for a down payment, she set a goal of having $500,000 invested in her retirement accounts. By April 2022, she had invested $200,000 and reached COAST FIRE — a strategy where you save and invest enough to eventually stop contributing to your retirement accounts and let the compound growth continue rising so you're on track to have a traditional retirement. She decided to quit her job.Kinoshita isn't alone in choosing to wait to buy a house. The median age of a first-time home buyer has gone up in recent years, from 35 in 2023 to 38 in 2024 alone, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.After quitting her full-time job, Kinoshita started working part-time, creating curriculum for California State University, Monterey Bay and making financial literacy content online. Both of these positions made her more money than when she was working as a software engineer.Kinoshita, now 34, is going to wait until she reaches early COAST FIRE, which, when you have enough invested, lets you stop contributing by the age you decide, versus the traditional retirement age of 67. Kinoshita quit her job and is now making financial literacy content online.Anita KinoshitaHer projected retirement age is now 45, and she expects to have $1.5 million invested by then.\"I value my time and freedom a little bit more than I value home ownership. In retrospect, I think if I had bought the house, I would have felt trapped in my career,\" she says.Kinoshita and her husband recently moved to the California neighborhood where they would one day like to own a home. They pay $4,000 a month in rent and live in a single-family home in a gated community, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.When the couple is ready to buy, she estimates they will have about $300,000 saved to put toward the home. But they still don't know when they will start getting serious about buying.\"I'm not in a rush. I don't want to use it as a financial tool in any way. I'm looking at it more as a luxury and less as an asset these days,\" she says. \"I would rather have my money working for me in the stock market than in real estate.\"Kinoshita and her husband are now renting in the neighborhood they hope to buy one day.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita says her definition of a dream home has also changed.\"I don't want too many bedrooms. I think what I care more about these days is the charming architecture. I don't want it to be overwhelming in terms of square footage. I want it to be in a really beautiful neighborhood where I feel safe. I want to look outside and see nature,\" she says.\"I don't see a reason to settle for something else, so for us it's a as long as it takes kind of thing.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "NANJING, CHINA - NOVEMBER 9, 2025 - Citizens shopping at a farmers' market in Nanjing, China's Jiangsu Province on November 9, 2025.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesDeflation pressures in China alleviated in October as consumer prices returned to growth after remaining in negative territory for the most part this year, helped by holiday season demand, with the decline in wholesale prices also moderating. Data from China's National Bureau of Statistics released Sunday showed consumer price index reading for October at 0.2%, compared with analysts' expectations of zero, or flat growth year on year. October's reading was the strongest this year, and the first positive growth in consumer prices since June. On a month-on-month basis CPI also rose by 0.2%, compared with analysts' expectations of zero growth. Food prices, which have been a drag on the country's CPI, dropped 2.9% year on year. However, prices rose 0.2% over the previous month.Factory-gate deflation eased with prices falling 2.1%, year on year, compared with Reuters' poll estimates for a 2.2% decline, completing three years in negative territory. Month-on-month producer prices rose by 0.1% in October. \"In October, policies aimed at expanding domestic demand continued to take effect, coupled with the boost from the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays,\" Dong Lijuan, chief statistician at the urban division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said in a statement.Read moreWhile China's steps aimed at reining in price wars and fueling demand seem to have started bearing fruit, with the country's industrial profits in September rising more than 21%, experts warn that Chinese local governments' dependence on tax revenue encourages sustained production, intensifying competition and overcapacity until there are meaningful tax changes.China's manufacturing activity in October declined more than expected, contracting to its lowest level in six months, according to an official survey released Oct. 30. The sub-indexes for production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all deepened their contraction, pointing to a sharp manufacturing slowdown and softer demand.Chinese producers have been in the throes of demand uncertainty owed to trade tensions with the U.S. this year and weak consumer confidence at home as Beijing struggles with a prolonged housing downturn and headwinds to exports.The country's exports in October unexpectedly contracted, with shipments to the U.S. clocking double-digit declines for a seventh consecutive month, down 25%, customs data released Thursday showed.Going forward, export headwinds could weaken as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to a trade truce during their meeting in South Korea on Oct. 30, defusing a potentially incendiary situation that had stoked worries of a full-blown trade war.China's leadership last month vowed to boost domestic consumption as it laid out the economic roadmap for the next five years. China must \"vigorously boost consumption,\" the meeting readout said, according to a CNBC translation.The leaders elaborated on the need for lifting consumption with calls to balance it with \"effective investment\" and \"adhere to the strategic point of expanding domestic demand.\"—  CNBC's Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowFed Governor Stephen Miran on Friday suggested that surging demand for dollar-denominated stablecoins could help push U.S. interest rates lower.In a speech delivered for an audience of economists in New York, the central bank official and appointee of President Donald Trump said the flood of crypto tokens pegged to the dollar could tamp down what economists refer to as \"r-star,\" or the \"neutral\" rate of interest that neither pushes nor impedes growth.If that happens, he said, the Fed might need to lower its own policy rate to avoid unintentionally slowing the economy.\"Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers,\" Miran said. \"Stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the United States, and this demand will continue growing.\"Citing prior research, Miran said stablecoin growth could push the Fed's benchmark rate down by 0.4 percentage point.During his short time on the Fed board, Miran has advocated aggressive rate cuts, in part because he thinks the neutral rate is considerably lower than most of his colleagues assume. His latest remarks extend that argument into the world of digital finance, suggesting that the rise of stablecoins could structurally lower borrowing costs for years to come.Previously, his arguments have been focused largely on moderating inflation and the importance of the Fed not impeding economic growth with higher rates. The stablecoin dissertation adds another wrinkle to the case for easier policy.\"Even relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down\" the neutral rate, he said. If neutral is lower, he added, \"policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy. A failure of the central bank to cut rates in response to a reduction in [r-star] is contractionary.\"Miran is expected to leave the Fed in January, when the unexpired term he is filling runs out.",

The food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), may run out of funding on November 1st due to the federal government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. In Miami-Dade County, nearly one in six residents receives food assistance. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday night temporarily paused a federal judge's order that directed the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans for November by the end of the day.The move came hours after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston denied the administration's emergency request to halt the order relating to food stamp benefits to primarily low-income people.But the appeals court also said it would soon rule on whether the administration was entitled to a stay of the order by U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell while its appeal of the order plays out.Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in the order on Friday night in favor of the administration, pushed the 1st Circuit to quickly determine whether to issue that stay.\"The applicants assert that, without intervention from this Court, they will have to 'transfer an estimated $4 billion by tonight' to fund SNAP benefits through November,\" Jackson wrote.That money was to come from so-called Section 32 funds that the Trump administration said it did not want to use to augment a partial payment of SNAP benefits that federal officials planned to make. The partial benefits payment would come from $4.6 billion in contingency funds set aside by Congress for that purpose.The administration originally planned not to pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the ongoing government shutdown.\"Given the First Circuit's representations, an administrative stay is required to facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution of the pending stay motion,\" Jackson wrote.She said that the Supreme Court's stay \"will terminate forty-eight hours after the First Circuit's resolution of the pending motion, which the First Circuit is expected to issue with dispatch.\"That two-day window would give time for the Trump administration, or plaintiffs in the case, to return to the Supreme Court to challenge any ruling by the 1st Circuit.It is not clear to what extent Jackson's order will affect payments of SNAP benefits.The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier Friday told states it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with McConnell's order, even as the administration appealed the ruling.The USDA's memo did not suggest that the administration would renege on that plan even if a higher court blocked the order.The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on Jackson's order, said, \"This decision is a tragedy for the millions of Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families.\"\"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration chose to fight this in court instead of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,\" said James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in another pending lawsuit seeking for force full SNAP benefits to be paid.\"Every day the federal government delays is another day that children, seniors, and families face real pain and suffering,\" Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageSenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration last week said it would not pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the federal shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 when Congress failed to pass a bill to provide short-term funding for federal programs, including food stamps. Past administrations have paid the benefits during other shutdowns.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of cities, unions, nonprofits, and a retailer, then sued the administration in Rhode Island federal court, asking McConnell to order that full benefits be paid for the month.McConnell on Oct. 31 ordered the administration to disburse at least partial SNAP benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund.He also ordered the administration to explore whether other pools of previously appropriated money could be used to fully fund SNAP, which costs about $8 billion per month.The administration on Monday said it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits in November by using the contingency funds. But it refused to use another $4 billion from a Section 32 fund that would have made up the difference in the SNAP payments. The administration two days later said a re-calculation found it could pay 65% of the SNAP benefits from the contingency fund.The plaintiffs then urged McConnell to order the administration to make the full SNAP payments from available funds. The judge did so on Thursday, saying at a hearing that the administration's decision to rule out Section 32 funds was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, he wrote in an order.The administration on Friday morning asked the 1st Circuit appeals court to block McConnell's order, even as the USDA issued its memo to states saying that it intended to comply with the ruling.On Friday night, a three-judge panel on that appeals court denied the administration's request.The panel noted that \"the government has not disputed that it may under [federal law] use the Section 32 fund to cover the provision of SNAP benefits for\" November.But the panel also said that the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] remains pending, and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 6, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk that could mark a turning point in how many people can access their costly blockbuster obesity drugs. Under the agreements, Medicare will start covering GLP-1s for obesity for certain patients for the first time beginning in mid-2026 – a shift that will open access to millions of older adults and could spur more employers and other private insurers to follow suit, some experts said. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also lowering the prices that all state Medicaid programs will pay for GLP-1s, but it's up to states to opt into coverage. Obesity drug coverage among state Medicaid plans, employers and other private insurers remains spotty due to the $1,000 or more monthly list prices of existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy. The limited insurance coverage has blocked out patients who can't afford their hefty price tags. That lack of access has led to mounting pressure on health plans and the government to expand coverage — and the government agreements with drugmakers could mark a major shift.\"I think it'll start with the government, start with Medicare, and the insurers will quickly follow,\" Nick Fabrizio, an associate teaching professor in Cornell's health policy program, told CNBC. \"I do think that's coming.\"\"This is a great step towards trying to address a chronic and serious issue, and for those patients who may feel like they have no hope,\" he said.Roughly 8 to 9 million people in the U.S. are using GLP-1s, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at a briefing with reporters on Thursday. The added Medicare coverage under the deal could bring in as many as 40 million new eligible patients, and prompt more commercial plans to cover the medicines, he said.The deals could also address the inability of many patients with limited or no insurance coverage for obesity drugs to access them, by offering the treatments at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx.gov. The monthly out-of-pocket cost of existing injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has. Still, there is a law prohibiting Medicare from covering weight loss drugs, so any changes would have to come from Congress. Eli Lilly's Ricks told reporters Thursday that for now, the government will launch an initial pilot program in the spring of 2026 under a temporary legal mechanism. It would be voluntary for Medicare prescription drug plans, so \"it may be possible that a few plans do not participate, but I would expect almost all do,\" he said. But Ricks said that it will transition into a formal so-called Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation pilot program in 2027, which means it will be mandatory for all Medicare Part D plans.\"So we expect broad coverage in all plans both in 2026 and beyond,\" he said.Medicare coverage could be a sea changeLikely the most notable feature of the deals is Medicare coverage of obesity drugs, as it will allow the treatments to reach new patients in the program and could lead to broader private insurance coverage. Under the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk agreed to cut the price Medicare and Medicaid pay for GLP-1s to $245 per month. In Medicare specifically, certain patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. People who qualify include patients with a body mass index of 27 or above with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease; people with a BMI of 30 or more with related health conditions; or those with severe obesity, or a BMI of 35 and above. GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. In a note Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger also said it's unclear whether the government will allow patients to stay on a GLP-1 for obesity after their BMI levels drop. Even with those restrictions, \"I think in practice, it's still going to cover a fair number of people,\" said Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the eligibility criteria mean 80% of the obese population in Medicare could receive coverage for GLP-1s, despite the limits.\"Today's deal will open up meaningful access to obesity drugs,\" Schott said in a note about Eli Lilly on Thursday. Lakdawalla added that while there isn't clear evidence that private insurers will expand coverage on the heels of government plans, \"it's just optically harder for them to continue to constrain coverage when Medicare and Medicaid are covering them.\" \"That's going to exert some pressure for commercial coverage of these drugs to expand as well,\" Lakdawalla said. Coverage for GLP-1s for obesity has ticked up slightly, but remains sparse: A May survey of more than 300 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that 36% provided coverage for GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, up from 34% in 2024. Medicaid, direct-to-consumer offerings could fill gapsLakdawalla said the direct-to-consumer offerings under the deal could be useful for people who are underinsured, uninsured or may not have coverage for obesity medicines. Still, it's unclear how many more patients the drugs will reach due to the offerings. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have introduced lower cost options for their drugs for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites. But the deals with Trump will give those patients even bigger discounts.On TrumpRx, the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior Trump administration officials. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both offered some GLP-1s on their direct-to-consumer platforms for up to $450 to $500 per month.Starting doses of obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — expected to hit the market next year — will be $149 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid.  Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.In terms of Medicaid, Cornell's Fabrizio said states will likely want to start covering obesity drugs at the lower price point, \"but the question is how will they pay for it?\"Around a dozen state Medicaid programs cover obesity drugs, according to 2024 estimates from KFF, a health policy research organization. While GLP-1s offer substantial health benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries, state programs are already facing constrained budgets and administrative demands.Fabrizio added that raising taxes to cover the drugs \"could be a sticky issue.\"Still, JPMorgan's Schott said offering lower prices to Medicaid programs could lead to a \"significant increase in coverage\" in that channel, where Zepbound has very limited uptake. ",

    "body": "Everyone who knows me knows that I can't stand owing money. I pay down my credit cards every month, and I complete Venmo requests the second I get them.The only debt I have left is my student loan, which has been on minimum payment autopilot since I graduated from college in 2013. For many years, I left those payments on the back burner, funneling any extra savings I had toward my investments.Recently, though, my financial strategy changed after my fiancé and I began planning for a wedding in summer 2027. I sold a fair amount of stock and dialed back my retirement contributions in order to build our wedding fund.For the first time in my life, I'm sitting on a pile of cash. And I have to say, I'm very tempted to use a chunk of it to wipe out my loan.Hear me out. My student debt carries an interest rate of 6.55% and is scheduled to be paid off in late 2027. If I paid my loan off now, I could take my monthly loan payment, plus a few extra dollars, tack it on to my regular contributions to the wedding fund, and still hit our funding goal on time. Plus, I'd be debt-free.I chatted with a few certified financial planners, and pretty much everyone agreed that the math works in my favor.\"If you have the funds available, paying off the loans first is a smart move,\" says MaryAnne Gucciardi, a CFP with Wealthmind Financial Planning. \"That's a guaranteed 6.55% 'return,' which is higher than what you're likely earning in even the best high-yield savings account.\"So as you're reading this, I've already paid the loan off, right? Well, no. I actually decided against it. Here's why.My decision to hold off on repaying my loan, for nowThe mathematical principle Gucciardi points out is an important one that applies to a broad array of situations in personal finance. Paying down a loan with a particular interest rate is equivalent to earning an annualized return on an investment.It's a quick and dirty way to decide how to prioritize your financial goals. If you have credit card debt at 20% — currently right around the average, according to Bankrate — paying it down is like earning 20% a year in the stock market. Because that's a figure your portfolio is unlikely to earn on a long-term basis, the thinking goes, you're better off prioritizing the debt.The same logic applies to my loan. The 3.4% annual percentage yield we're earning in our savings account falls short of the 6.55% I owe on my loans.The cost of making such a move, Gucciardi and others pointed out to me, is liquidity. Once I make the lump sum payment, I won't be able to go to my student loan servicer and ask for my money back. Catching up by the time of our wedding date is as easy as redirecting the freed-up cash from my student loan payment to put toward the wedding fund. But a lot could go wrong between now and then.What if I lose my job? Or one of us needs expensive medical treatment? Or elements of our wedding end up costing much more than we budgeted for? I have emergency savings, but a few things going wrong could make what looked really easy on paper into something really hard in real life.So I did some more math. I've paid off 81% of my student debt, meaning that the vast majority of my payment these days goes toward paying down the principal rather than the interest. By my calculations, paying the loan now, instead of continuing with minimum payments, would save me somewhere between $400 and $500 in interest.\"That net difference is the price of financial flexibility,\" says Sean Pearson, a CFP with Ameriprise Financial Services. \"It's the price of doing the things that you want to do that are the most important to you when you need to get them done.\"To be clear, my financial priorities might not be the same as yours, and it's worth discussing your own goals with a financial advisor. Right now, the wedding is the most important thing I'm saving money for. I want it be everything my fiancé and I envision, and I want our (frankly, too many) guests to have an amazing time. Having the extra cash on hand in case anything comes up is worth paying my student loan servicer an extra $400.It's a lesson I'm applying to my broader financial life too. While certain financial strategies are mathematically optimal, they may not fit within my particular set of goals.\"While imperfect, the best solution is often to make a budget that allows you to reach your priorities when they exist on your timeline and remember that the calendar is as important to your financial plan as your calculator,\" Pearson says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Cg Tan | E+ | Getty ImagesMillionaires are increasingly dissatisfied with their wealth managers and accountants, but they prize their personal trainers and therapists, according to a new survey.Only a third of millionaires use a wealth advisor for their financial planning and 1 in 5 plan to fire their advisor due to high costs and poor service, according to a new survey from Long Angle, the professional network for startup founders and CEOs. Among those who do use an advisor, 26% are considering switching and 18% may stop using an advisor altogether.By contrast, millionaires are highly satisfied with their personal trainers, therapists and other professionals who help with their overall wellness and family care, rather than financial issues.\"Improving your balance sheet or bank account doesn't deliver the same emotional value as improving your health and family life,\" said Chris Bendtsen, market intelligence lead at Long Angle. \"Services for personal well-being or your children score the highest.\"The results highlight the growing importance of so-called \"soft services\" for the wealthy, as wealth managers, private banks and other firms look to attract and retain more high-net-worth clients. Once considered superficial next to financial advice and tax planning, services for health and wellness, family and kids, and travel and self-improvement are becoming core competencies in the business of advising and helping wealthy families.For the study, Long Angle surveyed 114 people worth at least $2 million, with a majority having net worths of between $5 million and $25 million. It asked them to rank their satisfaction levels on 14 of the most common professional services used by the wealthy, from investment advice and estate planning to sports coaching and housekeeping.Personal services, child care and education ranked at the top for satisfaction. Out of a score of 1 to 10, millionaires surveyed gave their personal trainers an average score of 9.3, the highest satisfaction for any category of service. They were also happy with their investment-visa advisors (8.8), followed by their personal sports coach and therapist. They also placed high values on services for their kids, including private school (8.3) and day care (8.2).Financial, home and property services ranked at the bottom. The results for wealth management are especially notable. The satisfaction levels for wealth advisors was 7.2, with most of the respondents saying they don't even use an advisor. The use of financial managers increases with wealth. Among those with $5 million or less in wealth, only 22% use an advisor, compared with 44% for those with $25 million or more.Their chief complaint is cost. The median spending for financial advisors is $10,000 a year, according to the survey. A majority of respondents pay a fee based on a percentage of assets under management. A third of respondents pay a flat annual fee.Many clients increasingly see asset-based fees as inherently lopsided, since the manager gets paid more simply as a function of asset size rather than performance or service quality. The frustration over costs is one reason more advisors are moving to flat fees.\"Flat fee structures reflect a growing client preference for transparent pricing and reduced conflicts of interest,\" the report said.Beyond cost, wealthy investors are also frustrated with service.\"The general feedback is that advisors are often slow to respond and the advice is not personalized,\" Bendtsen said.Accountants and tax lawyers didn't fare much better. While 82% of respondents use a CPA or tax professional for their taxes, 42% are considering switching tax advisors. Their main complaints were that CPAs were slow to respond and weren't proactive or strategic enough.On estate planning, half of millionaires surveyed don't use an estate lawyer, although their use is highly dependent on wealth levels. Among those with $25 million or more, 69% use an estate lawyer. When it comes to satisfaction levels, estate attorneys ranked below pool services.The poor grades for financial and legal providers, and high marks for more personal services, go beyond the predictable emotional benefits of feeling and looking better every day. Athletic trainers, sports coaches, teachers and even housecleaners seem to be better at providing the kind of highly customized, goals-driven help that the wealthy are looking for, rather than cookie-cutter solutions commonly provided by wealth managers and lawyers.\"What we heard is that the wealth managers, estate lawyers and CPAs feel more transactional,\" Bendtsen said. \"They don't feel personalized.\"Services for children also get high marks and a high share of the wealthy's spending. The respondents spend an average of $53,558 a year on their nanny, $30,000 a year on private school and $20,000 a year on day care. Private school and day care both scored above an eight on satisfaction despite the price.Therapy is becoming increasingly important to the wealthy, especially the younger rich. Millionaires gave their therapists an average high score of 8.3. Their median spending on therapy is $5,000 a year.Nearly half (43%) of millionaires under the age of 40 use a therapist, compared to only 13% for millionaires over 50. Among those who use a therapist, the main benefits cited were quality of care and impact, as well as kindness and having a personal connection.\"I think people under 40 are more proactive about their mental health and emotional well being,\" Bendtsen said.",

    "body": "\"Neighbors need food NOW,\" the homepage of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana reads.Amid uncertainty around SNAP funding, food banks across the U.S. are scrambling to pick up the slack for the 42 million Americans who rely on the program for food assistance.SNAP payments have been paused since Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the program by Nov. 7. The administration quickly appealed the ruling and on Friday sought an emergency block on the order.While the larger legal battle continues, several states have said that they've started to process full food stamp payments, the New York Times reports.CNBC Make It spoke with leaders at several food banks about how they're responding to the challenges caused by SNAP cuts and the government shutdown.Brian Greene, the president and CEO of Houston Food Bank, describes the situation as \"a rolling disaster.\"SNAP payments are typically distributed on a staggered monthly schedule in Texas, Greene says, which means that each day since the beginning of November, another 125,000 Texans run out of EBT funds.As the shutdown drags on, a growing number of furloughed federal workers in Houston are turning to food banks for assistance, Greene says.\"Every day that this keeps going, the damage gets worse and worse,\" he says.Facing 'a great increase in need'According to Leslie Bacho, CEO of Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, the effects of the SNAP disruption are already becoming clear.Within its service area of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, more than 168,000 people rely on CalFresh, the state of California's version of SNAP, Bacho says.On Monday alone, over 1,500 unique users visited the bank's online food locator tool, which connects people to nearby food distribution sites, according to Bacho. That's nearly double the usual volume.Their hotline has also experienced a 200% increase in requests for referrals, she says.\"We're in the process of ordering additional food and really trying to ramp up for what we think will be a great increase in need,\" Bacho says.Jon Toups, the CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana, says his organization was \"stretched thin\" even before the SNAP delays.The Louisiana legislature has stepped in to help provide reserve funds for SNAP users, he says, but USDA cuts earlier this year had already caused supply shortages for food banks.There's \"no question\" that there's been an uptick in demand for food assistance in the past week, Toups says, and \"we're seeing an awful lot of anxiousness.\"For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine, Toups says, creating an even larger chasm of need for banks to fill.\"The shutdown is putting an additional strain on the food bank network when we can least afford it,\" he says.How food banks are respondingAbout 425,000 Houston households rely on SNAP, Greene says, and in order to meet their typical level of need, Houston Food Bank would have to double its output.They're currently using all available resources — Greene gave the bank's procurement team the go-ahead to \"spend what [they] need to spend\" — in an effort to increase output by about 50%.Right now, Houston Food Bank is in \"disaster response mode,\" Greene says.They've set up special distribution sites specifically targeting federal employees and SNAP users in parking lots across the city, including at Houston's NRG Stadium.Houston residents line up in their cars for a special free food distribution by the Houston Food Bank at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 1, 2025.Mark Felix | AFP | Getty ImagesIt costs around $15,000 to set up one of these \"supersites,\" according to Greene, and they're \"pulling in more volunteers and paying a lot of extra expenses,\" he says.At Second Harvest Food Bank South Louisiana, Toups requested to use a \"pretty significant\" amount of the bank's reserve funds to purchase more food, he says.He's also working to spread the word about the food bank's situation.\"Our community has really stepped up. We've seen an uptick in donations, not only financially speaking, but with their time, which is a huge piece for us,\" he says.Still, staff are \"overrun right now,\" he says: \"I almost feel like I'm asking them to work 24/7 right now to stay out in front of this.\"\"We will always do the best we can do,\" Toups says, but their current situation \"is not sustainable.\"Second Harvest Silicon Valley is in \"drop everything mode\" working to allocate 15% more food to each of their distribution sites, Bacho says.Crucially, while the charitable food system is already \"very, very strained,\" the last thing Bacho wants is for people in need to worry that banks will run out of food.\"Whether that involves going into our reserves, whether it involves raising more from our community or from our greater partnerships with our counties, we're going to do everything we can to meet that increase in need,\" she says.Still 'just at the beginning' of crisisBoth Toups and Greene liken the current situation to the aftermath of a natural disaster — but in those situations, \"the federal government was there to help,\" Greene says.\"In this case, the federal government is the cause, not the solution,\" he says.Right now, local giving is keeping many food banks and aid organizations afloat, according to Greene.\"If philanthropy holds up, we can keep doing this for quite some time,\" he says, but \"in a crisis, philanthropy shoots up, but it comes right back down.\"There are a few ways that people can support food banks right now, according to Toups.Primarily, food banks need monetary donations. That's the \"most efficient\" way to help, he says, \"because it allows me to actually use that money to go do exactly what's needed at that moment in time.\"Volunteers can also help food banks with tasks like sorting donations, packing boxes and distributing food, he says.At the end of the day, though, \"we've got to get back to some level of normalcy,\" Toups says.Right now, \"we're just at the beginning of this crisis,\" according to Bacho. As more days pass without SNAP funding, the demands on food banks will only increase, she says.\"We need this man-made problem in Washington, D.C. to resolve itself,\" Toups says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A recent string of high-profile layoffs have taken up headlines and caused anxiety in the workforce.Companies announced 153,074 layoffs in October, adding up to 1.1 million cut announcements for the year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That makes it the worst year for layoff notices since 2009, CNBC reported.But job experts say they're not in panic mode. Layoff news doesn't paint the whole picture of the job market. Private data around job openings, payrolls and employee sentiment show that hiring is cooling but \"not falling off a cliff,\" says Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao.The Challenger monthly data can be volatile, for one, and layoff announcements haven't yet shown up in state-level weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are still being released during the shutdown.\"I'm not alarmed,\" says Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research. The latest available data \"does not seem today to indicate that we're going into a high layoff period for the overall economy.\"Government shutdown and layoffs are hitting worker confidenceWhile economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon, news of layoffs and the government shutdown is hitting worker confidence.The share of Glassdoor reviews mentioning layoffs is up 22% year-over-year as of October, according to data from the jobs site. Workers' confidence in the job market is down from a small rise in September and is close to a recent record-low set in June, according to Glassdoor data.Senior-level employees saw the biggest drops in confidence over the last year, dropping 4.6 percentage points since October 2024.That's concerning since leadership confidence spreads to other employees through hiring and investment plans. If senior leaders aren't confident their business is doing well, they could decide to reduce hiring or lay people off, Zhao says.Meanwhile, for those on the market, fewer people say they've gotten a job offer and declined it, signaling they have less leverage and might be settling for jobs rather than holding out for better ones, according to Glassdoor data.Health-care openings are making up for losses elsewhereMany workers are additionally competing for a smaller pool of opportunities. As of Oct. 31, job postings on Indeed are at their lowest level since 2021, continuing a declining trend for the last four years.Job postings are lowest in areas hit by the government shutdown, including Washington, D.C., and recent tech layoffs, like California and Washington.Openings are concentrated in health-care sectors, security and safety, and engineering, which on the whole are keeping the job market stable.\"I see it a tale of two economies,\" Ullrich says. \"There are certain fields where jobs are continuing to be added, and there's others that are shedding jobs.\"Health care and private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time: They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but have accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025.\"If health-care employment started dipping that would ring alarm bells for me,\" Ullrich says.The bigger picture: 'The job market is in a funk'Economists say available datasets can provide a pretty good picture of the job market, but official data from the Labor Department around hiring and unemployment are necessary for a best look at the health of the labor economy.The unemployment rate remained steady 4.3% in August, the last month of available government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics missed another jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a drop in 60,000 jobs and a rising unemployment rate to 4.5%, CNBC reported.The numbers we do have point overall to a continuously slowing job market. Economic uncertainty is weighing on employers' willingness to hire, Zhao says, meaning job-seekers are frozen out of the market and employed workers have less leverage to progress in their careers, win raises and stay engaged in the workplace.Hiring experts say building your network and asking for referrals are the best ways to get a job right now. To stand out in a competitive market, consider sharpening your resume to be outcomes-based, building your personal brand on LinkedIn and doing mock interviews, GrowthLoop senior recruiter Kathleen Nolan previously told CNBC Make It.\"Overall, I would say that the job market is in a funk right now,\" Zhao says. \"Even if unemployment is even [and] some of the top line indicators still point to a job market that is not historically bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that people are happy with where the job market is today.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he will  issue an executive order \"shortly\" laying out the \"legal reasons\" for national voter-identification requirements.Trump, in posts late Friday to Truth Social, said he wants voter-ID laws implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.\"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.  \"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.In a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"Under pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers.President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday advanced, 218-213, a Trump-backed elections bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. All but one Democrat voted against the proposal, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions and make it harder for people including women whose birth certificates would not show a married name to register. It now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold just 53 seats in the chamber — and one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has come out against the proposal. More than a handful of Democrats would have to support the legislation for it to succeed. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has supported national voter-ID requirements, though he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that he doesn't support other voting restrictions such as limiting mail-in ballots.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that Democrats will block the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\"The SAVE Act is not a mainstream bill whatsoever. It's a fringe piece of legislation that has now taken over the Republican Party, masquerading as election security when it's really about laying the groundwork to meddle in the midterm elections and make it much harder for people to vote,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor this week.Trump has recently said he wants to nationalize federal elections and revived election conspiracies, launching an FBI investigation into the election results in Fulton County, Georgia, a state the president has repeatedly and without evidence said he won in 2020. States are granted control of most aspects of U.S. elections under the Constitution.In his second post on Friday, Trump cast the midterms in existential terms. \"(T)hese Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT with a total of 21 Supreme Court Justices, THEIR DREAM, which they will submit easily and rapidly when they immediately move to terminate the Filibuster, probably in their first week, or sooner,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it. Thank you for your attention to this matter — SAVE AMERICA!,\" he continued.",

    "body": "Dating is full of tiny money moments: choosing a restaurant, talking about travel, splitting a check, and deciding whether a gift is \"too much.\" You don't need to ask someone how much they make, what their net worth is, or how much student loan debt they carry to learn how they approach money and what kind of financial partner they might be.Talking about money with a potential partner is never just about money. It's about values, habits, and expectations around how someone thinks a \"team\" should work. What not to ask early onOn your first few dates with someone, can you imagine actually asking, \"How much do you make?\" Or, \"What's your net worth?\" I wouldn't be surprised if they excused themselves to the restroom and didn't come back. The irony is, those questions aren't even the best way to get at what you're trying to learn. Someone can earn a lot and still feel financially unstable. Someone can earn less but have excellent systems, habits, and boundaries. The goal is to understand how they think about money and what their values are. 7 money questions to ask on a dateStart with these questions that invite real answers, stories, preferences, and patterns — and reveal their financial mindset more organically.\"Where did you grow up and what was it like?\" It's a basic getting-to-know-you question, but you'll learn a lot about the environment they were raised in, their family norms, and the lifestyle they consider \"normal,\" without forcing them into specifics.\"Tell me about your family. What were they like when you were a kid?\" People will tell you what shaped them if you give them an opening. Pay attention to themes like stability, ambition, generosity, privacy, education, status, faith, and community. These are the things that drive financial decisions.\"What was your first job?\" This is an easy way into someone's relationship with work, motivation, and independence. Did they feel proud, pressured, supported, or alone? Did they work well with other people? Those early experiences tend to show up in adulthood, including how someone thinks about earning and financial stability. A first job often reveals what money represents to them: freedom, security, responsibility, or survival. It can also hint at their default habits, like whether they saved their first paychecks, spent them immediately, or used them to help their family.\"Are you more of a planner or a wing-it person?\" This is a window into how someone handles uncertainty, and money is full of uncertainty. Two people can be completely different here and still work, but it helps to know what you might be signing up for early on — before life gets busy and important financial decisions have to be made.\"What's something you'll happily spend on and something you refuse to overpay for?\" Most people have \"yes\" categories and \"no\" categories that reflect their values. You can learn how they perceive things like convenience, health, quality, experiences, style, generosity, and savings. It's also a great way to talk about spending without getting into budgets.\"What's your ideal vacation?\" Vacation preferences are just as much about money expectations as they are about travel. A \"camping in national parks\" person and a \"boutique hotel and tasting menu\" person can find common ground, but it's helpful to learn early what someone assumes about cost and how they handle it when planning trips with other people. Do they openly talk about a budget before booking, or hope it all just works out?\"When you get stressed, what do you like to do?\" You're not fishing for a perfect answer. You're learning how someone copes with stress, because stress changes how people spend, save, and communicate about money. Some people plan. Some distract. Some shut down. Some spend. The key is whether they recognize their patterns, because self-awareness is what allows us to better manage our behaviors.When to get more directWhen money stops being theoretical and starts showing up in decisions that affect both of you — moving in, splitting regular expenses, building a shared life — it's time to have more direct and specific conversations.Money doesn't have to be a third wheel on your early dates with someone new. Start with questions that reveal how they think and live, and save the hard numbers for when you're building something together. That's how you avoid surprises and set the relationship up to last.Douglas A.

    "body": "The Alibaba stand at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference at the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition Center in Shanghai, China, on July 5, 2024.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhile U.S. markets have been focused on the impact of Anthropic and Altruist's tools on software and financial services, China's tech giants have released AI models this week that have shown advancements in robotics and video generation.Alibaba, TikTok creator ByteDance and short-video platform Kuaishou, have all released new AI models that underscore how Chinese firms are keeping up with those in the U.S.It comes after Google DeepMind boss Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models are just \"months\" behind Western rivals. These models from China are directly competing with video generation models such as OpenAI's Sora, as well as robotics models from Nvidia and Google. Here's a rundown of the models.watch nowAlibaba's RynnBrainAlibaba's DAMO Academy unveiled RynnBrain this week, an AI model designed to help robots comprehend the physical world around them and identify objects.In a video demo, Alibaba showed a robot with pincers for hands that appeared to be able to count oranges, pick them up and place them in a basket. It was also shown taking milk out of a fridge.Models require extensive training to enable them to identify everyday objects to interact with, which means that simple tasks like picking up fruit can be challenging in robotics.RynnBrain now puts Alibaba in competition with the likes of Nvidia and Google which are developing their own AI models for robots.\"One of its key innovations is built-in time and space awareness,\" Adina Yakefu, a researcher at Hugging Face, told CNBC.\"Instead of simply reacting to immediate inputs, the robot can remember when and where events occurred, track task progress, and continue across multiple steps. This makes it more reliable and coherent in complex real-world environments.\"Yakefu added that Alibaba's \"broader ambition\" was to \"establish a foundational intelligence layer for embodied systems.\"ByteDance's Seedance 2.0Seedance 2.0 is a video generation AI model capable of generating a realistic video from just a text prompt from a user. But prompts can also contain other videos and images. Videos created with Seedance 2.0 and reviewed by CNBC appear to show quite realistic imagery and video that has been fully created with AI.Billy Boman, who is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and runs a creative advertising agency that produces AI-generated content, has used Seedance 2.0.He said AI video generation has made significant strides over the past two years, with rapid improvements across the industry.watch now\"Back in 2023 … it was difficult to get someone to run or to walk. Any type of realism was [limited to] very short clips, everything was very slow, bad textures, no skin textures, lacking detail. Now the script has flipped. Now I can do anything. It has been nothing short of exceptional, the technological advancements,\" Boman told CNBC in an interview. Hugging Face's Yakefu, added that the Seedance 2.0 model has shown progress from previous generations in \"controllability, speed and production efficiency.\"\"Seedance 2.0 is one of the most well-rounded video generation models I've tested so far. It genuinely surprised me by delivering satisfying results on the first try, even with a simple prompt. The visuals, music, and cinematography come together in a way that feels polished rather than experimental,\" Yakefu said.However, while users have praised the technology, Seedance has run into trouble. Local Chinese media reported that Seedance has suspended a feature that allowed the AI to generate the voice of a person based on a picture they uploaded. It came after a blogger in China raised concerns about the voice generation taking place without consent. ByteDance was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Kuaishou's Kling 3.0Released last week, Kuaishou's Kling 3.0 is another video generation model to rival ByteDance's. Kling 3.0 \"features major upgrades in consistency, photorealistic output, extended video duration up to 15s, and native audio generation across multiple languages, dialects, and accents.The model is only available to paying subscribers but will be available to the public soon, Kuaishou said.Kuaishou's success with its Kling models has been a key factor behind its more than 50% share price rise over the last year. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKuaishou shares year-to-dateOther key AI model releasesZhipu AI — which trades as Knowledge Atlas Technology in Hong Kong — saw its shares surge on Thursday after it released GLM-5, an open-source large-language model with enhanced coding capabilities and long-running agent tasks.The company said the model approaches Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 in coding benchmarks while surpassing Google's Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. CNBC could not verify those claims. Shares of MiniMax also jumped Thursday after it launched its updated M2.5 open-source model with enhanced AI agent tools. \"Agents\" or \"agentic AI\" refers to AI tools designed to automate tasks. — CNBC's Anniek Bao and Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "In the world of big food, artificial intelligence is nothing new.McCormick, which owns brands including Frank's RedHot, Cholula and Old Bay, has been using AI in flavor development for nearly a decade, with the company saying its development timelines have been cut by 20% to 25%, on average, by identifying promising flavor combinations and narrowing down which ideas are worth testing in physical prototypes. It's a similar story at Unilever, where AI is deeply embedded across food research & development, with systems able to test thousands of recipes digitally in seconds and get to viable concepts with fewer physical trials. Unilever's Knorr Fast & Flavourful Paste, as an example, was developed in roughly half the usual time. On the packaging side of the business, AI modeled how formulations behave in Hellmann's Easy-Out squeeze bottle — which the company says saved months of physical lab work. All the way back in 2017, a team from Google Brain (which is now part of DeepMind) used AI to help create a recipe for the \"perfect\" chocolate chip cookie.But even as AI is increasingly shaping how food companies decide what ends up on grocery store shelves, the food companies are quick to stress that AI is not taking over the kitchen.\"Human creativity and judgment lead the way, and AI is a tool to help us amplify our impact,\" said Annemarie Elberse, head of ecosystems, digital and data for foods R&D at Unilever. \"These tools help inspire our flavor scientists' creativity,\" Anju Rao, McCormick's chief science officer, told CNBC. Rao emphasized that AI functions as a co-creation tool, not a replacement for human expertise.  \"Our greatest asset will always be our people who bring global perspectives, flavor expertise and human creativity to the table,\" she said. As a growing ecosystem of startups position AI as a way to approximate and predict sensory outcomes using large datasets to model how consumers might respond to new food products before they are physically tested, it's not clear how successful their efforts will be in cracking the code in the test kitchen. Companies including Zucca, Journey Foods, NielsenIQ, and AKA Foods market their platforms as \"virtual sensory\" or AI-powered systems designed to digitally screen recipes, suggest formulation changes, and predict consumer liking before physical prototypes are made. These companies are promising much of what the food giants say they've been doing already: creating systems that can reduce the size of traditional taste panels, lower the risk of failed launches and compress product development cycles by identifying promising concepts earlier in the process. Industry analysts estimate the global market for artificial intelligence in food and beverages will grow from roughly $10 billion in 2025 to more than $50 billion by 2030, driven by rising investment in data-driven product development, automation, and personalization. But some early food AI pioneers have already moved on. McCormick's early AI work was developed in partnership with IBM, which previously explored AI-driven food projects such as Chef Watson. An IBM spokesman said in a statement the company is \"not actively focused in this area anymore.\"Behind the marketing language, food scientists who have tested these platforms say the technology is still early — and that many of the claims are as much about attracting capital as replacing human expertise. Brian Chau, a food scientist and founder of food science and food systems consultancy Chau Time, said many AI food startups are still in the data-collection phase, working to aggregate enough real-world information to make their models meaningfully predictive. \"I think all the AI companies coming out are, to some extent, overstating what they can do — that's true of most startups,\" Chau said. \"They need to attract investors, they need to build datasets, and they need real industry partners before any of this really works at scale.\" Chau said most current platforms resemble large language models trained on existing recipes, manufacturing data, and consumer trends rather than systems capable of independently generating viable new products. \"When I tested one platform, the output was basically what you'd get from any general AI system,\" he said. \"There wasn't much added value without proprietary data from real companies.\" In his view, the technology's long-term potential depends on whether startups can secure partnerships with large food manufacturers willing to share internal formulation data — something many companies are reluctant to do because of intellectual property concerns. \"Without big industry players feeding real data into these systems, it's very hard for them to become truly predictive,\" Chau said. \"It's a numbers game.\" Where AI food science still falls short From a scientific standpoint, researchers say the biggest obstacle is not computing power — it's biology. Dr. Julien Delarue, a professor of sensory and consumer science at the University of California, Davis, said expectations around AI-driven sensory tools may be inflated by misunderstandings about what AI can realistically model. \"I would say there is probably a little bit of hype,\" Delarue said. \"It doesn't mean that AI is not useful, it's just not what people expect from it.\" While AI can help analyze chemical data and improve efficiency in food development, Delarue said trying to predict how people will perceive complex flavors remains fundamentally limited. \"Trying to predict what people will perceive from a complex mixture of compounds — the answer is no,\" he said. One of the core challenges, he explained, is that human sensory perception is inherently variable. People perceive the same chemical compounds very differently depending on genetics, culture, experience, and even personal history. \"There is no such thing as the average consumer,\" Delarue said. \"Trying to predict what the 'average' person may perceive is probably a dead end.\"To unlock this limitation, Delarue says, we would need much more data than we currently have — access to data at the individual level, knowing what each person or group actually perceives. \"And that's a huge task,\" he added.That variability makes it difficult for any model — human or machine — to serve as a universal proxy for taste, he said. Even the companies building these tools emphasize that human judgment remains central. David Sack, founder of AKA Foods, said his company's platform is designed to organize internal R&D knowledge, not replace food scientists or sensory experts. \"Food R&D teams sit on large amounts of valuable knowledge, from past formulations and sensory data to tacit know-how held by individuals,\" Sack said. \"But it's often fragmented and difficult to reuse systematically.\" Why humans will remain the tastemakersAKA's platform helps teams test ideas digitally before committing to physical trials, allowing scientists to focus on the most promising formulation paths. \"It does not replace food scientists or sensory experts,\" he said. \"Ultimately, humans define the goals, constraints, and success criteria. Sensory experts design and interpret panels. Scientists decide what to test and what to launch. AI can reduce the number of tests needed, but it does not eliminate the need for real human tasting or validation. Humans will always need to be in the loop when the end consumer is human,\" he said. \"Consumers decide with their palate whether they like a product,\" said Jason Cohen, founder and CEO of Simulacra Data, a company that uses AI to analyze sensory and consumer data. \"We still start with real human sensory data. AI just helps us extrapolate insights faster and cheaper.\" Cohen, who also founded Analytical Flavor Systems, which was acquired in 2025 by NielsenIQ, said AI is most useful for identifying off-flavors, narrowing formulation options, and prioritizing which ideas are worth testing, not for replacing human perception. Chau says large food companies are uniquely positioned to benefit from AI-driven tools because they already control vast amounts of proprietary formulation, sensory, and manufacturing data — something most small brands are still trying to build. Delarue thinks the real value of AI within the food industry will be in efficiency not creativity — helping researchers analyze data faster, manage complexity, and operate under increasing constraints around health, sustainability, and cost. \"Designing food today is much more challenging than before,\" he said. \"You don't just want to make food that people enjoy. You need to make food that is healthy, sustainable, and affordable. AI gives us more power to handle that complexity.\" But when it comes to taste itself, humans are still the reference point. \"Consumers will always be the ones who decide what tastes good,\" he said. \"Not machines.\" ",

    "body": "Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAt some point in the 1980s and 90s, the free hot breakfast became a staple of the hospitality industry. At many a Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn, the lobby at 8 a.m. is a pinwheel of pajama-clad kids, frazzled parents, and solo business travelers jockeying for position in front of the waffle maker. Meanwhile, self-serve cereal bars dispense Froot Loops and Lucky Charms, and hot platters of endless eggs and turkey sausage steam under heat lamps. For many, this breakfast spread is part of the appeal of travel. It endures to this day, but it is facing new economic threats and evolving hotel business models. At hotels, which have been ditching items like free soaps and even bathroom doors to economize, the free breakfast is a sacred cow that some worry will not survive, increasingly seen by hotel operators as an money pit eating into the thin margins of the business. Last year, Hyatt Hotels' Hyatt Place brand removed free breakfast from 40 of its properties. Holiday Inn, owned by IHG, eliminated a la carte breakfast items in favor of a buffet-only model — a cost-cutting measure that preserves the breakfast buffet offering while reducing labor and food waste. Gary Leff, who runs the travel blog View from the Wing and first reported on Holiday Inn's breakfast changes, said that the threat to the free breakfast should be viewed within the broader trend in the lodging industry to look for ways to cut costs for owners. \"That goes far beyond breakfasts, to things like housekeeping — less often during a stay, less extensive when it's done during a stay — to bulk toiletries rather than individual mini-bottles to eliminating products like alarm clocks in rooms,\" Leff said. Despite the free breakfast's staying power, the math never added up for the business, according to Curtis Crimmins, the CEO and founder of boutique hotel concept Roomza. \"It was a loyalty play — a loss leader meant to drive signups, repeat bookings, and extended brand loyalty. I would argue that once free breakfast makes the shift from being a 'surprise and delight' endearing moment to an expectation, then its days are numbered,\" Crimmins said. \"Looking for proof of this slow demise in your average Holiday Inn Express breakfast area? Look no further than the recent explosion of 'Grab and Go' options. That's not a coincidence,\" he said. Leff says that catering to a more affluent customer, as in the case of Hyatt Hotels, may offer operators more latitude to eliminate breakfast. A Hyatt spokesperson said while the company has \"tested breakfast options at select Hyatt Place hotels that offer guests the ability to book rates that do not include breakfast ... Most Hyatt Place hotels in the U.S. continue to offer complimentary breakfast to all guests.\"Evaluations are ongoing. \"As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering value to our guests, including World of Hyatt members, we are continually evaluating breakfast options that best serve our guests and our hotels,\" the Hyatt spokesperson said.    Leff says Hyatt has not released data on the trial, and many guests probably just assume breakfast will be free when they book at this point. \"Unclear yet whether Hyatt can get away with not doing limited-service breakfast,\" he said. In the current economy with higher-income consumers leading the spend, luxury has been a bright spot within travel. Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano describes the hotel business right now as being emblematic of the K-shaped economy receiving so much attention. \"There are economic headwinds and some uncertainty but we continue to see the consumer prioritizing travel and experiences,\" Capuano told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" last week after its most recent earnings. \"Luxury was a real highlight for us,\" Capuano said, adding that 10 percent of Marriott's portfolio is in the luxury tier.  watch nowMarriott has made breakfast changes in some overseas luxury locations. For instance, the Regis Macao eliminated free breakfast for Platinum, Titanium, and Ambassador loyalty members as of March 2025 and replaced it with bonus points or discounted breakfast instead. Some Reddit users have posted this month about free omelettes disappearing from Marriott breakfast bars and now being part of the paid full breakfast buffet, but a Marriott spokesman said that is not a company-wide policy and, if true, would be individual hotel operators making that decision. The majority of travelers expect free breakfastThe consumer split is leading to a bifurcation of breakfast models, with higher-end customers going towards paid eggs benedict and homemade croissants while middle- and lower-income consumers crowd the free buffet.To be sure, Americans like their hotel breakfast. Among guests who partake of hotel food and beverage during their stay, the vast majority (78%) eat breakfast in the hotel, according to the 2025 JD Power North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Study. Of that 78 percent, only 8 percent is paid, primarily at upper tier hotels where the trend is taking root. Andrea Stokes, hospitality practice lead at JD Power, said that data suggests guests continue to rate breakfast as an important part of their hotel stay. \"This proportion is even higher at limited-service upper midscale and midscale hotel brands where complimentary breakfast is typically part of the hotel brand's standard offering,\" Stokes said. When JD Power asks upper midscale and midscale hotel guests to rate the importance of hotel features or amenities, about half (47%) rate complimentary breakfast as \"need-to-have\" (versus only nice-to-have). Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesMitchell Murray, CEO of Station House Inn and three other boutique hotels in Lake Tahoe, California, says while large chain hotels can offer economies of scale, free breakfast can account for roughly 5% of total revenue, closer to 6–7% once labor is included. \"That's a meaningful cost, and many operators are asking, 'Does free breakfast actually generate 5% more revenue or bookings?' In many cases, the answer is no,\" Murray said. He added that when breakfast is free, quality often suffers — think mediocre coffee, watery eggs, frozen potatoes. \"It's edible, but rarely memorable or value-adding,\" Murray said. One of Murray's properties is a Holiday Inn Express which he is transitioning to an independent hotel this year and where he plans to do away with the free breakfast after the change, once freed from corporate mandates. Major hotel brand franchisors have specific brand standards that franchisees must adhere to, and this includes food and beverage standards. Best Western, though, has no plans to unplug the waffle iron. \"Offering a complimentary breakfast is an important part of our guest experience across much of our portfolio,\" said the hotel chain's CEO Larry Cuculic. \"For travelers, free breakfast simplifies the stay, delivers meaningful value and influences booking and loyalty decisions, especially in the midscale and upper-midscale segments,\" Cuculic said. Cuculic says the economics still make sense: breakfast supports guest satisfaction and repeat business, by leveraging the purchasing power of its extensive hotel network, Best Western can help hotels manage costs while maintaining quality and consistency, \"making breakfast both a friendly touchpoint for guests and a driver of long-term loyalty,\" he said. Holiday Inn Express is also standing by the free breakfast bar. \"Breakfast plays a critical role in our value proposition and continues to be a major reason why travelers choose to stay with us – it's something they know, trust, and expect from our brand, \"said Justin Alexander, vice president, global brand management for Holiday Inn Express, Staybridge Suites & Candlewood Suites. How changes to hotel menu will influence travel planningHotel breakfast factors into the travel planning of Aimee Misovich and her family. The Holland, Michigan, resident said that her family are Hilton Honors members. \"So we always stay at their properties — typically, Embassy Suites, Homewood or Hampton Inn. All three still offer free hotel breakfasts,\" Misovich said, adding that she likes the variety offered. \"Homewoods began offering overnight oats and chia puddings. I do partake of the latter. Other times I'll just have a bagel with cream cheese, or a sausage patty inside a bagel for a breakfast sandwich of sorts,\" Misovich said. While she added that the quality can vary from property to property, the breakfasts are still appealing. \"I certainly hope Hilton keeps their free breakfasts! After all, they're not really 'free'—I'm sure they're factored somehow into room prices,\" Misovich said. She also noted that foods she eats at hotel breakfasts are rarely ones she eats at home, \"so they're a treat to me when we travel.\" The food and beverage offering, even if only for breakfast service, can be a key differentiator for limited-service hotel brands. \"Any hotels that consider scaling back or eliminating free breakfast must focus on demonstrating value in other ways,\" Stokes said. Rita Chaddad, a faculty member who teaches courses on tourism and hospitality management at Columbia Southern University, predicts that free breakfast will continue to be eliminated in the luxury brands but remain in some form elsewhere, though travelers should expect more changes to come. \"Breakfast is likely to remain, but the model may become more segmented,\" Chaddad said. In upper-midscale settings, hotels may be more willing to offer breakfast through credits, optional add-ons, or targeted inclusion — for example, through packages or loyalty benefits. \"In these tiers, hotels may have more flexibility to replace 'free' with perceived value in other forms, provided it is communicated well and the guest feels the trade-off is fair,\" Chaddad said. But she added that many of the middle-tier hotels compete on simple, visible value, and breakfast is one of the clearest signals of that value, so there is risk of backlash if it is completely eliminated. \"Removing it can create a perceived loss that may outweigh operational savings, even if the hotel's overall cost structure improves behind the scenes. For value-oriented travelers, breakfast is often interpreted as part of the 'deal,' and losing it can complicate the guest's mental math when comparing properties,\" Chaddad said. Chaddad said hotels will increasingly play with the offering, and beyond higher-tier hotels, travelers should be on the lookout for new models showing up as room-only versus breakfast-included choices, breakfast offered through packages or loyalty benefits, or other redesigned formats that control costs while keeping the benefit visible to guests. \"The shift may be less about eliminating breakfast and more about adjusting who receives it, how it is delivered, and how clearly it is priced or bundled,\" she said.While some of those changes may add to the hotel bottom line, they could come with an added emotional cost. \"My kids and I would be really sad if they discontinue free hotel breakfasts. It's part of the fun of traveling,\" said East Tennessee resident Joanne Peterson. ",

    "body": "It's a sunny, 70-degree February afternoon in Los Angeles, and crowds have been pouring into Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters' home nonstop.A stereo system filters music into their kitchen, dining area and through the open doors to their backyard, where dozens of people sip coffees, chat in groups or type away on their laptops.The couple isn't just entertaining friends and family. Wayser, 39, and Watters, 42, are the creators behind LA's hottest new coffee shop, Granada, which the married couple runs out of their own home in Echo Park's Angelino Heights.Just over a month into their venture, they say they're having their busiest day yet.Like usual, they opened their doors at 9 a.m. Within hours they sold out of their pastry selection, had to DoorDash additional milk and called on a neighbor to go for an ice run. It's 2:30 p.m. by the time I arrive, 30 minutes to close, and there's still a line to order.The fact that the home-based cafe has been such a hit in a town with \"so many phenomenal coffee shops\" is still a shock to Wayser, who says they \"didn't expect this at all.\"\"I think that people really want community,\" she says. \"My guess is the part that feels so special is just the private intimacy of being in a house.\"Granada is one of the latest small businesses to open through California's Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation, or MEHKO, program, which allows residents to make and sell food from their home. Given the cafe's instant success, more Angelenos could be opening their own micro-restaurants soon, meaning the new hottest place to hang out could literally be in your own backyard.A home-based coffee shop takes shapeWayser and Watters first heard about the MEHKO program last summer thanks to reporting from KCRW and The New York Times. The program was introduced in California in 2019 and authorized in LA County in 2024.Wayser says she didn't think much of it at first. Then, she became fixated.The couple had regularly attended a neighbor's family-style dinner hosted from their garage during the pandemic, which Wayser says felt like a home-based pop-up restaurant. They'd also specifically designed their own home, which they bought in 2019, for entertaining.Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters opened Granada, a coffee shop they run from their home, in January.Talitha BullockAs a new mom, Wayser says she was figuring out how to spend her days with her 3-year-old daughter heading to preschool. As a musician, artist and designer, she was eager to find a new way to put her skills to use, especially with her work in film and TV up in the air as the industry struggles.Wayser says she's spent her career producing shows, planning events, managing business finances and running an LLC for her creative work. When she thinks about it, \"I have been an entrepreneur my whole life,\" she says. \"I just didn't really put it together, because it's always been my art.\"She and her husband, a fellow musician and visual artist, have collaborated on design projects throughout their relationship, including their home. Running a coffee shop together sounded like a fun new experiment.The couple spent months going through the process of getting a MEHKO permit, which includes food safety certification, business licensing and inspection from LA County's Department of Public Health. They say the $597 application review fee was waived because they were among the first 1,000 businesses in the program. The annual health permit for MEHKO businesses, which covers annual inspections and enforcement, costs $347.The MEHKO program sets a cap on gross annual sales of $100,000; businesses are limited to 30 meals per day or 90 per week. MEHKO operators can also be approved to serve as a commissary for up to two food carts, which would expand the amount of meals they can serve per week and also bump their gross annual sales max to $150,000 per year.I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works.Sydney Wayserco-founder of GranadaThroughout the fall, Wayser and Watters got to work outfitting their home kitchen with espresso machines, additional dining and seating areas, custom ceramics from local artist Amy Louise Johnson and new artwork fit for a modern cafe. They asked a friend to refer them to a \"coffee wizard\" and teamed up Chad Aaron to create their coffee menu; they also tapped local baker Sasha Piligian for their pastry selection.Granada officially opened its doors in January 2026.An emerging neighborhood hot spotBecause of the limitations around MEHKO, skyrocketing sales isn't the goal for Granada. Wayser says they'll consider shortening their hours or limiting days of service in order to stay in operation for a longer stretch throughout the year.Other than potentially launching a coffee cart or two to raise their MEHKO sales cap, Wayser says they don't expect to open a commercial coffee shop. \"As soon as you're in a commercial space and your rent is so high, it's not about community anymore,\" she says. \"The reason this works is that you can buy something or not. You can hang out in the yard as long as you want. We will be paying our mortgage no matter what.\"Granada offers a menu of classic espresso drinks, teas, and pastries sourced from local baker Sasha Piligian.Oscar Mendoza, Talitha Bullock, Amber CanterburyWayser says Granada's visibility could bring new business opportunities, like courting clients to host private events, concerts and art shows from their home.She also hopes the coffee shop's success inspires other people to strike out on their own. There are currently about 265 MEHKO-permitted operations throughout LA County.Wayser says that while the program wasn't necessarily designed to encourage new parents, specifically new moms, to start a business, it's had that effect on her. \"There aren't very many things where you're able to start a new business in such short time period\" or around a condensed schedule, like the typical school day, she says.\"I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works,\" she says, adding that the stakes are lower without having to rent out commercial space.She's already heard from one inspired friend.\"Our neighbor just today said that maybe he'll apply for MEHKO and start making sandwiches and serve [them] out his window, which would be really fun,\" Wayser says. \"This would become MEHKO Alley.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Lechatnoir | E+ | Getty ImagesEmployers don't appear eager to mix their 401(k) plans with emergency savings options for workers, new research suggests.Although companies have been permitted since 2024 to allow $1,000 emergency withdrawals from retirement savings and to offer 401(k)-linked emergency savings accounts, there's been little adoption, according to a Vanguard report released this week. Just 4% allow the $1,000 emergency 401(k) withdrawals, according to Vanguard's analysis of 1,300 plans. And the 401(k)-linked emergency savings accounts \"have generated minimal to no interest\" from employers, the report notes.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsFollowing Super Bowl ad, Trump accounts launch a new sign-up optionCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThose two in-plan options were authorized under the 2022 retirement legislation known as Secure Act 2.0, amid growing concern about Americans' lack of emergency savings.Although the vast majority of employers are not providing the 401(k)-linked accounts — technically called pension-linked emergency savings accounts — some companies are offering external emergency savings accounts, said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research for the Employee Benefit Research Institute. These external accounts are generally held at FDIC-insured banks and after-tax contributions are made through payroll deductions.Covering a $1k emergency is a challenge for manyBuilding and maintaining emergency savings can be tricky for many households, especially those that are struggling to keep up with the high cost of living. Although inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.4% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index.Financial advisors generally recommend having three to six months' worth of living expenses set aside as emergency savings.Yet just 47% of respondents in a December survey said they have the funds to cover a $1,000 emergency expense, according to Bankrate's yearly Emergency Savings Report, released last week. Additionally, 29% said they have more credit card debt than they do in emergency savings. Last year, employer worries about their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, up from 43% in 2024 and 39% in 2023, according to December research from EBRI. As recently as 2019, the year before the pandemic hit, that share stood at 22%.Contributions count toward 401(k) limitSecure 2.0 created the pension-linked emergency savings accounts as a \"sidecar\" to a 401(k). That is, they are established and maintained within the 401(k) plan itself. Among other particulars, contributions are after-tax — treated as Roth contributions — and count toward the 401(k) contribution limit. For 2026, that amount is $24,500, with investors age 50 and older allowed an additional $8,000.The legislation set the maximum annual contribution for the emergency account at $2,500 with inflation adjustments in the future, and this year it was increased to $2,600. As for the $1,000 emergency 401(k) withdrawal: Most employers — 94% as of 2024, according to Vanguard — already allow their workers to access their retirement savings if they are facing financial hardship. \"In many cases, it would add something that's already being provided,\" Copeland said.While employers have largely eschewed the Secure 2.0 emergency savings provisions, that could change over time. \"If a plan sponsor wants to move forward with an emergency savings program at their company, they're going to analyze the options available, and part of that [analysis] will be what's easiest to implement,\" said Will Hansen, executive director of the Plan Sponsor Council of America.\"A $1,000 withdrawal is easier than a [401(k)-linked account] and an account not affiliated with the plan could be an easier feature as well,\" Hansen said.Among other administrative complexities, one of the sticking points with 401(k)-linked accounts is that highly compensated employees — under one IRS test, those earning $160,000 or more — are not permitted to participate. That's an administrative challenge because workers' incomes can fluctuate, which makes it tricky for a 401(k) plan's recordkeeper to monitor, said Brandie Barrows, a partner with Hall Benefits Law in San Francisco.A bipartisan bill introduced in December in both the House and Senate would expand eligibility to use the accounts. Called the Emergency Savings Enhancement Act, the measure would eliminate the exclusion for highly compensated employees and would increase the annual contribution limit to $5,000.\"It wouldn't hurt to take that exclusion off and increase the amount that people can save,\" Barrows said.External accounts are 'less complicated'In the meantime, experts say, employers will likely continue to partner with external firms that offer emergency savings accounts. Recent research from EBRI shows that 51% of firms with 500 or more employees offer some sort of emergency fund. That includes external savings accounts, but is not broken out in the data.\"If they offer it outside the plan, it's pretty straightforward,\" Copeland said. \"It's less complicated\" than setting up an account within the 401(k) plan, he said. There is a liquidity issue, as well, with keeping emergency funds inside a 401(k) plan, Copeland said. \"Outside the plan, it's much easier to get your money immediately, whereas getting it out of the plan could take two to three days at a minimum,\" he said.",

Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.Trump has since effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil, called its government \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the move and said: \"Surrender is not an option.\" He's since said the government is prepared to hold talks with Washington, albeit \"without pressure or preconditions.\"The country has warned that international airlines would no longer be able refuel in the country due to fuel shortages. Gripped by a worsening economic crisis, Cuba's government recently adopted rationing measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a shorter working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. \"The current situation in Cuba is as serious as it has been since the 1990s, when Cuba suddenly had to survive without the support of the Eastern Bloc,\" Par Kumaraswami, professor of Latin American Studies at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, told CNBC by email.The odds are shortening that President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be forced from power in the weeks or months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition.Robert MunksHead of Americas research at Verisk MaplecroftTrump's tariff threats have created a deterrent for many nations, Kumaraswami said.Mexico has sent humanitarian aid but suspended oil shipments, as it sought to preserve its relationship with Havana while avoiding Trump's tariffs.Kumaraswami said there was \"of course frustration with the difficulties of daily life,\" but that \"many Cubans are resolved to resist threats to their national sovereignty and a new wave of patriotism has emerged.\"'An accelerating collapse' Air Canada subsequently has canceled all flights to Cuba amid the fuel shortage, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country home over the coming days. Tourism is a significant source of revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped government and the country is a popular winter vacation destination for Canadian tourists.  A Turkish Airlines plane takes off at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on February 9, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesUnlike in previous crises, Cuba's regime lacks foreign partners that can step in to help, according to Robert Munks, head of Americas research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \"Raising the stakes, the US has also limited Cuba's access to hard currency and pressured Nicaragua to end visa-free travel for Cubans,\" Munks told CNBC by email.The government's pledge to increase the use of limited renewable energy sources is likely \"too little, too late,\" Munks said. He added that outbreaks of civil unrest were possible, given that the island's domestic energy production is far short of what it needs to keep the lights on. \"An accelerating collapse of basic services will put the regime under extreme pressure to find a negotiated solution,\" Munks said.He added that \"the odds are shortening\" on Díaz-Canel being forced from power in the months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition, but Munks said it was more likely that \"the regime will try to muddle through\" until the U.S. midterm elections in November.Read moreCuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" last week.\"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.A big test for BRICS Cuba's emergency measures should be seen as crucial test for the BRICS bloc of developing nations, according to Helen Yaffe, a Cuba expert and professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\"This is probably the most important test now for BRICS … If BRICS cannot protect, defend and rally around a member, then what is it worth?\" Yaffe told CNBC by telephone.  Cuba acquired \"partner country\" status of the BRICS group in January last year, bolstering its ties with the likes of Brazil, Russia and China. Indeed, each of these three countries have sought to offer support to Cuba in recent days.The Mexican government has dispatched humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba aboard two ships of the Mexican Navy. More than 800 tons of supplies were transported by sea from Asipona, in Veracruz, Mexico, on February 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\" They added that China would, \"as always,\" seek to provide assistance to Cuba.Russia, meanwhile, has described Havana's fuel situation as \"truly critical\" and said U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The Cuban government is not going to submit,\" Yaffe said. \"The fact is, [the U.S. is] going to keep squeezing and the Cubans are going to keep resisting and there's going to be a lot of unnecessary suffering.\" She added: \"I'm a historian and it's very vainglorious for historians to try and predict the future but we can look at trends — and I can guarantee you that we were here before in the early 1990s where nobody thought Cuba would pull together and pull through — and they did.\"",

Photo: Sven Hoppe/dpa (Photo by Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images)Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesMany European policymakers appear to still be smarting from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's tough words about the region at last year's Munich Security Conference.So, it's perhaps not too surprising that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments on Saturday at this year's event underscoring the U.S. and Europe's common heritage, goals and challenges have come as something of a relief in European capitals.\"[Rubio] delivered a speech which still assured us that we stand together in this partnership between Europe and the United States,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. \"Of course, there are some questions which we will have to discuss, but in the end of the day, his message was clear that we were so successful in the past, and we should do the job once again with new threats, with new tests in the 21st century.\"On Saturday, Rubio said the U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed.\"We want Europe to be strong,\" he told the gathering of defense and security officials in the German city. \"We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"Contrast that to Vance's message to the same crowd last year, when he spoke of the \"retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\" He lambasted his audience about the health of their democracies, their migration policies and freedom of speech.While Rubio's tone might have been more conciliatory than Vance's, the underlying issues remained the same, as some conference attendees acknowledged.watch now\"Of course, there were some issues he raised. We would answer differently when it comes to the migration problem, when it comes, of course, to question how we organize our legal framework here in Europe with regard to the digital services. And of course, also with the question of freedom of speech and so,\" Wadephul said.U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for its open migration policies, for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.\"The message we heard (from Rubio) is that America and Europe are intertwined, they have been in the past and will be in the future,\" the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said at a panel discussion on Sunday. \"I think this is important. It is also clear that we don't see eye-to-eye in all the issues and that this will remain the case. But I think we can work from there.\"'Europe bashing'A recurring theme at this year's event has been an earnest investigation into how Europe can stand on its own two feet, militarily and economically, in the face of challenges from Russia and China while the U.S. seeks to rework the global post-war order it created.While European leaders acknowledge they must become less dependent on the U.S.'s security umbrella and markets, some bristle at the Trump administration's more confrontational approach compared to its predecessors.\"I think there were messages for us, and there were messages for the public in America, especially their constituents,\" Kallas said. \"For me, every time I hear this European bashing, it's very in fashion right now, I'm thinking of what is the alternative?\"Kaja Kallas, vice president of the European Commission, at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026. Nuclear deterrence is set to be a hot topic at the conference. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOthers were even more critical of Rubio's comments.\"To be frank, I think the fact that we have, for Europeans, [been] asked to comment on the speech by the Americans, is already part of the problem,\" Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for Europe, said at the same panel.\"We should not either be relieved or shocked by this or that speech. And I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say 'I can cling to some love words I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button.'\" He said Europe should \"just focus on ourselves, focus on what we can control. Focus on our rearmaments, on the support for Ukraine, and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies. Focus on competitiveness.\"Wadephul told CNBC that work to become more independent is underway.\"But this is what we are doing on our own, and Europe has also learned that, of course, if you ask for more European sovereignty, you will receive it,\" he said.\"And that also means that, of course, we are more independent than we were in the past. And of course, we are looking for new global partners in the world which are willing to work together with Europe, for instance, Japan, India, Brazil and so on. So this is, I would say, if you are looking to a new global order, this means we keep our alliances, but additionally, we have new global partners, and this is a good future for Europe.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he walks to board Marine One prior to departure from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's iron grip on the Republican Party might be starting to loosen, just a bit. The few elected Republicans who regularly cross him — including Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are more vocal than ever. And in recent days, daylight has emerged between the president and a handful of his top supporters in Congress.The apparent shift is underway as Trump, the Republican Party's undisputed leader, grapples with stubbornly low approval ratings — especially on the economy, a perennial issue on which he was elected that has only grown more important to Americans chafing under high prices.Six U.S. House Republicans voted this week to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada. Tillis remained resolute in holding up the president's Fed chair nomination in protest over a Justice Department investigation of the current one. The administration pulled back the sustained anti-immigration law enforcement push in Minnesota. And fallout from the Epstein files — in which Trump and allies are mentioned — is roiling the world and its most powerful players.Democrats are jumping on the opening, with some pushing a narrative that \"the tide is turning\" on Trump. Their perceived momentum follows big wins in last fall's off-year elections after hammering an affordability message, and as prediction markets favor them to win control of the House in the midterms.\"Trump's grip on power is slipping,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Thursday in a gloating social media post. \"Nobody is taking his bulls--- that somehow he's lowering prices for families.\"The administration's efforts this week to wrest the affordability narrative — by drawing attention to Trump's drug-pricing initiatives, or to gains in the stock market, or to projections that Americans' tax refunds will rise this season — have been muddied by the deluge of political setbacks and controversies. Trump on Friday gave a passing glance to curbing price increases when he spoke to troops in North Carolina hours after the release of January consumer price index figures that showed slowing inflation.He's had fewer public appearances since a racist social media post last Friday, a shift from his recent cadence of Oval Office appearances in front of reporters with supporters from the political ranks and business community. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a frequent press conference partner of Trump, but his visit to the White House this week yielded no public remarks.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about challenges to Trump from the Republican Party, said the party will stay together with the president as its leader. \"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy,\" Leavitt said via email.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinThe majority-GOP House of Representatives' vote to override Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods only came about because three Republican members previously sided with Democrats to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July. Trump's threats of retaliation didn't thwart the end result.While the tariff votes are almost purely symbolic, they show GOP leadership failing to stop enough of their members from publicly defying Trump on his signature economic policy. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House to prevail on party-line votes.A day after the House tariff vote, U.S. border czar Tom Homan announced the government would wrap up its immigration enforcement \"surge\" in Minnesota, following public outcry against federal agents' aggressive tactics exacerbated by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.A new AP-NORC poll found most Americans think the administration's deployment of deportation forces has gone too far, and that the GOP's advantage on immigration has shrunk since last year.The Minnesota actions drew fiery pushback not only from protesters and Democrats but also from business owners. In an open letter shared Thursday, more than 266 businesses from across the U.S. that said they represent 100,000 others warned the government's actions threaten free markets. A series of other Trump-related stumbles have drawn national focus away from the administration's attempt to tout its accomplishments.Last week, the president's social media account posted a racist image depicting the Obamas as apes. Numerous Republicans spoke out forcefully and quickly against the post, including close Trump ally Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Senate Republican, who called it \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.\"The White House initially defended the post, but after the flood of bipartisan outrage, pivoted to blaming it on an unnamed staffer. Trump subsequently condemned the image but refused to apologize.This week, a federal grand jury rejected U.S. prosecutors' attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers, weeks after Trump accused them of sedition for telling military members not to follow unlawful orders. It is highly unusual for grand juries to decline to indict.The Department of Justice is also in the midst of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose refusal to quickly slash interest rates has made him a top target of Trump's ire.The probe, which Powell says is retaliatory, has prompted vocal pushback from Republicans worried about the erosion of the central bank's long-established independence.Tillis, who is retiring at the end of his current term, is blocking all Trump administration nominees to the Fed — including Kevin Warsh, the president's pick to replace Powell — from advancing through the Senate until the DOJ drops the investigation.The president has said U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, a Trump loyalist, should continue the probe to completion. Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he does not believe Powell committed a crime —while Trump has repeatedly claimed Powell is either corrupt or grossly incompetent, complaining about cost overruns on building renovations. Numerous Republicans on the Banking panel agree that Powell did not commit a crime, according to Tillis.Trump is also grappling with the fallout from the DOJ's release of millions of its files on notorious sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, which is only intensifying days after the latest disclosures. Trump had opposed a bill forcing the DOJ to publicly share its files, but he reversed course as a growing number of Republicans geared up to vote for it anyway. The newly released records have revealed ties between Epstein and administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has since admitted visiting Epstein's island for lunch with his family in 2012.",

    "body": "Mesh Cube | Istock | Getty ImagesThe stock market has been quick to punish software firms and other perceived losers from the artificial intelligence boom in recent weeks, but credit markets are likely to be the next place where AI disruption risk shows up, according to UBS analyst Matthew Mish.Tens of billions of dollars in corporate loans are likely to default over the next year as companies, especially software and data services firms owned by private equity, get squeezed by the AI threat, Mish said in a Wednesday research note.\"We're pricing in part of what we call a rapid, aggressive disruption scenario,\" Mish, UBS head of credit strategy, told CNBC in an interview.The UBS analyst said he and his colleagues have rushed to update their forecasts for this year and beyond because the latest models from Anthropic and OpenAI have sped up expectations of the arrival of AI disruption. \"The market has been slow to react because they didn't really think it was going to happen this fast,\" Mish said. \"People are having to recalibrate the whole way that they look at evaluating credit for this disruption risk, because it's not a '27 or '28 issue.\"Investor concerns around AI boiled over this month as the market shifted from viewing the technology as a rising tide story for technology companies to more of a winner-take-all dynamic where Anthropic, OpenAI and others threaten incumbents. Software firms were hit first and hardest, but a rolling series of sell-offs hit sectors as disparate as finance, real estate and trucking.In his note, Mish and other UBS analysts lay out a baseline scenario in which borrowers of leveraged loans and private credit see a combined $75 billion to $120 billion in fresh defaults by the end of this year. CNBC calculated those figures by using Mish's estimates for increases of up to 2.5% and up to 4% in defaults for leveraged loans and private credit, respectively, by late 2026. Those are markets which he estimates to be $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in size.'Credit crunch'?But Mish also highlighted the possibility of a more sudden, painful AI transition in which defaults jump by twice the estimates for his base assumption, cutting off funding for many companies, he said. The scenario is what's known in Wall Street jargon as a \"tail risk.\"\"The knock-on effect will be that you will have a credit crunch in loan markets,\" he said. \"You will have a broad repricing of leveraged credit, and you will have a shock to the system coming from credit.\"While the risks are rising, they will be governed by the timing of AI adoption by large corporations, the pace of AI model improvements and other uncertain factors, according to the UBS analyst.\"We're not yet calling for that tail-risk scenario, but we are moving in that direction,\" he said.Leveraged loans and private credit are generally considered among the riskier corners of corporate credit, since they often finance below-investment-grade companies, many of them backed by private equity and carrying higher levels of debt.When it comes to the AI trade, companies can be placed into three broad categories, according to Mish: The first are creators of the foundational large language models such as Anthropic and OpenAI, which are startups but could soon be large, publicly traded companies.The second are investment-grade software firms like Salesforce and Adobe that have robust balance sheets and can implement AI to fend off challengers. The last category is the cohort of private equity-owned software and data services companies with relatively high levels of debt.\"The winners of this entire transformation — if it really becomes, as we're increasingly believing, a rapid and very disruptive or severe [change] — the winners are least likely to come from that third bucket,\" Mish said.watch now",

Nathan Howard | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro said on Sunday that the White House may force data center builders to absorb their costs as voters continue to sour on the economy and utility prices soar. \"All of these data center builders, Meta on down, need to pay for all, all of the costs,\" Navarro said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"They need to pay, not only pay for the electricity that they're using on the grid, but they have to pay for the resiliency that they're affecting as well. They need to pay for the water. So there's activity, action here going forward, where we force them to internalize the cost.\" Navarro did not detail what the White House's plan to force data center builders to internalize costs would look like. CNBC has reached out to the White House for clarification.Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinData centers and their drag on utilities are part of the affordability problem. Electricity prices spiked 6.9% year over year in 2025 and show little sign of easing. Navarro sought to pin the blame for soaring costs on former President Joe Biden, who left office over a year ago. \"I just want to assure people that we're on it, we also feel your pain,\" Navarro said. \"We understand the ravages that inflation took on you because of Joe Biden's irresponsibility, but we are addressing that with economic policy that ultimately will make wages rise faster than the inflation rate, and that's the key to affordability.\" But Americans increasingly blame the Trump administration for rising costs. As the November 2026 midterms approach, polls consistently find Trump underwater on the economy. Democrats are pounding Trump and the Republicans on affordability, arguing that everyday goods and services have grown too expensive. Democrats have taken a 5.2 point lead in the generic ballot ahead of the November midterm elections that could loosen Trump's grip on Washington, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics.While Navarro sought to blame the former president's administration for Americans' struggle with affordability, Trump himself has said he's \"very proud\" of the state of the economy. In an interview with \"NBC Nightly News\" that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday, the president was asked, \"At what point are we in the Trump economy?\" \"I'd say we're there now,\" he replied.The Trump administration has recently taken steps to address the strain on data center electricity and rising utility costs. Several states and the White House signed a pact in January urging the nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to make big technology companies pay for new power plants on the system. PJM operates the grid in some of the most data center-heavy areas in the U.S., including northern Virginia and New Jersey. Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey both romped to victories in their states in 2025 after campaigning to lower electricity costs. The pact called for $15 billion in new generation capacity within PJM, to be financed by tech companies, and urged the operator to hold an emergency auction to procure the power. The move comes as the administration simultaneously fights offshore wind projects in the Northeast, some of which are fully permitted or under construction. \"Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM,\" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said after the announcement. \"That's why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.\"POLITICO last week reported on a draft compact that the White House wants tech companies to sign to ensure data centers don't affect consumers' utility bills.Trump said last month on Truth Social that he had struck a deal with Microsoft \"to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills.\" The president added that his administration was negotiating with other tech giants and that there would be \"More to come soon!\" Microsoft pledged last month not to raise utility costs near its data centers, and to replenish water used by the centers.",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesFor homeowners who sell their house later in life, that timing may come with a cost, new research suggests.Once sellers reach about age 70, they start getting lower sale prices for their houses compared with younger homeowners, according to a January research brief published by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.Compared to sellers in their 40s and 50s, an 80-year-old homeowner gets a 5% lower price for a house held for about 11 years, according to the study. On a typical home price of $405,400 — the national median sale price in December, according to the National Association of Realtors — this amounts to a loss of $20,270. This gap continues growing as homeowners age.It's a scenario that more home sellers may be poised to encounter.As of 2024, there were 65 million baby boomers — those born 1946 through 1964 and in their 60s and 70s now — accounting for 20% of the U.S. population and 36% of total homeowner households, according to Freddie Mac.Those older homeowners are largely staying put, which at least partly contributes to the lack of housing availability and elevated prices in the current market — although those factors are starting to ease. About 68% of baby boomer homeowners say they will likely age in place, according to a 2024 report from Freddie Mac. Why older sellers may see lower returnsPart of the disparity in returns is tied to home maintenance: Homes sold by older owners are more likely to show signs of deferred upkeep or fewer upgrades, according to the research. That can weigh on sale prices even after accounting for location and market conditions.Additionally, the research indicates that older homeowners are more likely to sell through private, off-market listings — deals that never appear on the public Multiple Listing Service, or MLS, where most buyers search via online real estate sites. Those sales limit competition and are more likely to involve investors, which is associated with lower sale prices, according to the CRR briefing.The study linked housing transactions in CoreLogic's database, which includes details like sale date, price and deed type, to voter registration records — which are limited to U.S. citizens and primary residences — to establish the sellers' ages. Researchers also conducted a repeat-sale analysis to compare sales of the same home over time, using data spanning from 1998 to 2022.Median home equity for age 65-plus is $250kFor many homeowners, their house will be one of their largest assets as they head into retirement. In 2022, median home equity for homeowners age 65 and over was $250,000, up 47% from $170,000 in 2019, according to a 2023 report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. That amount represents roughly 50% of the median wealth among households for 65-year-olds or older.As Americans stay healthier and live longer, more are selling their homes later in life, said Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research for the National Association of Realtors.\"We're seeing that [sellers] are making transactions at later ages than they used to,\" Lautz said. watch nowIn the 70-to-78 age group, 38% of homeowners have lived in their house for 21 years or more, according to the NAR's 2025 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends report. In the 79-to-99 age group, that share is 44%.Also in that latter age group are 15% who sold their house for less than 90% of the listing price — the largest share of any age group, according to the report. At the same time, however, they are also the least likely age group to offer incentives to buyers — e.g., home warranties, assistance with closing costs, etc. —Lautz said.Planning ahead is key to maximize home's valueExperts say that it's important for retirees and near-retirees to be aware of those pricing trends, especially if they are counting on their home's value as part of their retirement plan.\"From what we see working with older homeowners, lower sale prices usually come from deferred maintenance and last-minute decisions [that are] often driven by tight cash flow in retirement,\" said Joon Um, a certified financial planner with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California.\"Small fixes get delayed, then buyers notice everything at once and price it in,\" Um said.Planning ahead can make a big difference, he said. Things like \"setting aside some cash for upkeep, decluttering over time, and tying the home sale into a broader retirement and cash plan can help avoid selling under pressure,\" Um said.Small fixes get delayed, then buyers notice everything at once and price it in.Joon UmCertified financial planner with Secure Tax & AccountingIt's also worth adult children, neighbors or other family members keeping an eye on the upkeep of an older loved one's home.\"To the extent that you have a relationship with an older person, protect their interests and make sure they're taking care of their house,\" said Philip Strahan, coauthor of the Center for Retirement Research report.As for the actual sales process, be sure you fully understand your options for selling and how your choices can impact the price you get.\"When older people interact with the [real estate] brokerage community, maybe they should consult with adult children, someone they trust to help them,\" Strahan said.At the same time, there may be reasons that the lower sales price is a trade-off the homeowner is willing to make. For example, Strahan said, some may not want others going in and out of their house, so a private sale is preferable, even if it means a lower price.Or, perhaps an expensive maintenance project goes unfixed prior to the sale in exchange for the discounted price, said Lautz, of the real estate agents' group.Either way, the key is to have a plan in place so you can maximize the value of your home as part of your retirement plan, experts say.It is \"a big retirement asset, not just a place to live,\" Um said. \"Managing it proactively can protect both value and cash flow.\"",

    "body": "Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of Dubai speaks at a news conference on Nov. 10, 2005 in New York City. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe CEO of Dubai's largest port has been replaced by the company after details of his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.On Friday, DP World announced in a statement that it had appointed Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.The U.S. Department of Justice's latest release of files related to Epstein revealed that the financier once referred to Sulayem as a \"close personal friend\" and called him one of his most trusted friends in other files. Sulayem has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. A disclosure to Nasdaq Dubai, where DP World maintains listed bonds, said Sulayem had resigned \"effective immediately.\"Sulayem was at the helm of Dubai's largest port operator as chairman since 2007 and CEO since 2016.The statement made no mention of Sulayem but said the company \"affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai's position as a leading hub for trade and logistics.\"CNBC sought comment from Sulayem through DP World, where he served as chairman and CEO, but did not receive a response.Kazim was most recently the governor of the DIFC, Dubai's financial center. Narayan was deputy CEO and CFO at DP World since 2005. Sulayem is one of Dubai's most prominent business figures, coming from one of the Emirate's main families. His father was an advisor to the ruling Al Maktoum family and Sulayem played a key role in the ascendance of Dubai as an economic hub.Sulayem oversaw the growth of Dubai's Jebel Ali port into a major deep-water shipping hub and the expansion of DP World into an international logistics empire that now oversees ports handling a tenth of the world's container trade.He also led Nakheel Properties, a Dubai government-owned developer, though he was replaced amid a major board restructuring following Dubai World's debt issues during the 2008 financial crisis. A 'close personal friend' of Epstein The extent of Sulayem's relationship with Epstein emerged in recent weeks following the release of the latest files.The records show the Emirati businessman was in contact with Epstein after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Authorities have stressed that a mention in the Epstein files does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Jeffrey Epstein and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group CEO of DP World.House Oversight Committee Democrats Pressure from DP World's partnersThis week, pressure mounted on Sulayem to resign after international partners paused new deals with DP World, calling for the company to take the \"required action.\" Canada's second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, which has invested more than $5 billion alongside DP World over the past decade, said it would pause \"additional capital deployment alongside the company.\"In a statement sent to CNBC, La Caisse said it was \"important to distinguish the company, DP World, from the individual, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who is the focus of the current situation.\"\"On that point, we have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions,\" the pension fund added. A spokesperson for British International Investment, which invests with DP World in four African ports, said it would also pause new investments.\"In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company.\"",

    "body": "Habits shape how we work, how we manage stress, and how we relate to others. They determine whether we move closer to our goals, or repeat the same mistakes.The same is true in our romantic relationships. Our satisfaction, stability and sense of connection are directly related to the behaviors we default to every day. As a psychologist who studies couples — and as a husband — I've seen how some of the most powerful relationship rituals also happen to be the simplest. Here are five habits that reliably show up in the happiest, most resilient relationships.1. Actively celebrating each other's good newsHumans are biologically wired to focus on the negative. This bias helped our ancestors survive by scanning for threats. But in modern relationships, it often leads to pessimism, criticism or chronic dissatisfaction.Over time, a glass-half-empty mindset trains partners to look for problems rather than moments worth appreciating. That's why what researchers call \"capitalization,\" or how partners respond when the other shares good news, is so important.Studies show that when people respond with enthusiasm (i.e., asking questions, expressing interest, celebrating wins), couples report higher relationship satisfaction and stronger emotional bonds.2. Maintaining relationships outside the partnershipFeeling like your partner is \"your person\" matters a lot, but no one can realistically meet all of another person's emotional, social and psychological needs.Happy couples invest in friendships, family relationships and community connections, both together and independently. It prevents the relationship from becoming overburdened by unrealistic expectations.When partners feel socially supported beyond the relationship, they're less likely to feel resentful, trapped or emotionally depleted. The relationship becomes a place of choice, not obligation.3. Creating 'third spaces' togetherVariety is called the spice of life for a reason. Even strong relationships can begin to feel stale when the novelty disappears. This is especially true for couples who live together and work demanding jobs; the cycle of work, home, sleep and repeat can become monotonous over time.This is why happy couples actively seek out what researchers call “third spaces,\" or environments that exist outside of home (the first place) and work (the second place). It could be a favorite café, a climbing gym, a walking trail, a trivia night, or a class they take together.The primary purpose of the third space is intentional exploration. When you regularly introduce new third spaces into your routine, you inject a sense of novelty and adventure without needing to travel or make any major life changes.4. Practicing independence alongside togethernessConsistency and support are foundational in healthy relationships. But over time, some couples begin to over-rely on one another — for emotional regulation, decision-making or daily logistics. This can slowly lead to codependence.Happy couples counteract this by practicing independence. They maintain solo hobbies, spend time alone, or handle some responsibilities individually.This independence is vital for maintaining a sense of self. More importantly, it enables something many couples underestimate the value of: the chance to miss one another.5. Staying emotionally up to dateWaking up next to the same person every day can create the illusion of deep familiarity. Many couples assume that physical closeness naturally begets emotional closeness, but this is not the case. People grow and change in little ways more often than we realize.Happy couples always remain curious. They remind themselves that they’re both constantly evolving. By making time to ask questions, they also begin to notice all the new dreams, wants and needs in their partner. This protects them from one of the most common relationship pitfalls: distance despite proximity.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

We'll of course, stay very, very close to that but … we're taking a surgical, thoughtful approach on any pricing,\" said Gass. \"We know that we're a brand that is known for great quality and value. We don't take that for granted. We know we have to earn that every day.\" </p><p>Finance chief Harmit Singh added demand is \"really strong\" and most of the company's revenue growth is not coming from price increases.</p><p>Price hikes are helping Levi's margins, but the company is also discounting less and selling more through its own website and stores instead of wholesalers, which comes at a higher margin. </p><p>The denim maker said its strong results led it to raise its full-year outlook, but added<strong> </strong>it's still taking a \"prudent\" and \"conservative\" look at the rest of the year as it navigates ongoing macroeconomic volatility, Singh said. </p><p>Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li>Earnings per share: 34 cents adjusted vs. 31 cents expected</li><li>Revenue: $1.54 billion vs. $1.50 billion expected</li></ul><p>Though Levi's posted better-than-expected results, shares dropped more than 6% in extended trading. Its stock had climbed about 42% this year through Thursday's close.</p><p>The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 31 was $218 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $20.7 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to impairment and restructuring charges, among other expenses, Levi posted adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share. </p><p>Sales rose to $1.54 billion, up 7% from $1.44 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Levi's is now expecting its full year sales to rise 3%, up from its prior guidance of between 1% and 2% growth, far exceeding expectations of a 2.9% decline, according to LSEG. </p><p>It's expecting its full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.27 and $1.32, up from a prior range of between $1.25 and $1.30. At the high end, the outlook is in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.31 per share, according to LSEG. </p><p>The jeans company said it's expecting its operating margin to be between 11.4% and 11.6%, which is also in line with expectations of 11.6%, according to StreetAccount. It's now expecting its gross margin to rise by 1 percentage point, which is the outlook Levi's delivered earlier this year before it factored tariffs into its forecast. At the time, its guidance didn't reflect any tariff impact. The following quarter, it cut its gross margin guidance by 0.2 percentage points because of the new duties. </p><p>Now, Levi's is returning to that original outlook, as long as U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and rest-of-world duties stay at 20% for the remainder of the year. </p><p>Under the direction of Gass, Levi's has been working to grow its direct sales, expand beyond jeans and win over more female shoppers – strategies that helped the business grow both its top and bottom lines. </p><p>During the quarter, direct-to-consumer revenue, or sales from Levi's website and stores, grew 11%, driven by strength in the U.S. market, while women's was up 9%. Levi's is benefiting from strong momentum in the denim category, but the company is growing its assortment outside of just jeans, which gives it a hedge if fashion trends change.</p><p>Other types of clothes beyond denim bottoms, including tops, now make up nearly 40% of the business. The company's efforts to sell more tops is also resonating with consumers, as that category was up 9% during the quarter.</p></div>",

It was Ferrari's worst trading day since the automaker publicly listed on the Milan stock exchange in early 2016.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed down by 15% at $407.38 apiece, marking the stock's worst trading day since Ferrari listed in October 2015. The stock's largest single-day decline was previously 12.4% in February 2016.</p><p>The U.S.-listed shares, with a market cap of nearly $77 billion, are now down about 4% for the year.</p><p>Analysts at Citi said in a research note that Ferrari's guidance \"falls below our 'lower growth case' estimates from our CMD preview and reflects conservatism from management, we think.\"</p><p>They added, \"Given guidance, albeit conservative, implies limited operating leverage through the coming cycle we think there is some risk to both consensus EPS and multiples near-term.\"</p></div><div><p>A picture shows the entrance of the historic Ferrari factory in Maranello on February 18, 2025.   </p><p>Federico Scoppa | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>In a separate <a href=\"https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/ferrari-capital-markets-day-2030-strategic-plan\" target=\"_blank\">update</a>, Ferrari said it would target a 2030 sports car model lineup made up of 40% internal combustion engine, or ICE, cars, 40% hybrid and 20% fully electric vehicles.</p><p>Ferrari said the revised target, which is down from a prior goal of 40% EV sales by the end of the decade, is the result of a client-centric approach, the current environment and its expected evolution.</p><p>The pivot comes as the Italian carmaker lifted the hood on the technology set to power its maiden electric vehicle. Ferrari unveiled the production-ready chassis and powertrain of the \"elettrica\" during a technology and innovation workshop, saying it would start deliveries of the model in late 2026.</p><p>The completed car is expected to be launched at a global premiere next year.</p><p>\"With the new Ferrari elettrica, we once again affirm our will to progress by uniting the discipline of technology, the creativity of design and the craft of manufacturing,\" John Elkann, executive chairman of Ferrari, said in a statement.</p></div><h2><a></a>Electric ambitions</h2><div><p>Several global carmakers have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/autos-car-giants-forced-to-confront-hard-truths-over-ev-transition.html\">scaled back their EV sales targets</a> in recent months, citing factors such a lack of affordable models, a slower-than-anticipated rollout of charging points and intense competition from China.</p><p>Sweden's Volvo Cars, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/swedens-volvo-cars-scraps-plan-to-only-sell-electric-vehicles-by-2030.html\">abandoned</a> its heavily promoted plan to sell only EVs by 2030, saying in September last year that it needed to be \"pragmatic and flexible\" amid changing market conditions.</p><p>Ferrari, which has seen its current number of active clients grow to 90,000, an increase of 20% compared with 2022, also said it planned to launch an average of four new cars per year between 2026 and 2030.</p><p>Analysts at JPMorgan were bullish following the announcements laid out in Ferrari's 2030 Strategic Plan.</p><p>\"We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on its long-term plan given ample evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,\" analysts at JPMorgan said Thursday in a research note.</p><p>\"We also estimate the company benefits from CEO Benedetto Vigna's leadership style, which has challenged the company to capitalise on collaboration to increase the speed at which it embraces innovation. An imminent Supercar launch may also have the potential to turbocharge profits,\" they added.</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/michael-bloom/\"><em>Michael Bloom</em></a><em> and </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/michael-wayland/\"><em>Michael Wayland</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p><p><em>Correction: Ferrari said at its Capital Markets Day event that it expected net revenue of at least 7.1 billion euros ($8.2 billion) this year.

href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span>, for allegedly helping Chinese companies evade curbs on U.S. chip exports.</p><p>\"The Singapore Police Force confirms that investigations are ongoing into Megaspeed for suspected breaches of our domestic laws,\" the police told CNBC in an email.</p><p>The probe comes as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/technology/nvidia-chips-china-megaspeed.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Thursday that the U.S. Commerce Department was also investigating whether Megaspeed skirted American export controls, citing anonymous officials and other people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The twin investigations into Megaspeed could raise questions about Nvidia's ability to track its chip exports effectively and to comply with U.S. restrictions on the sale of its most advanced AI chips to China. </p><p>According to an Nvidia spokesperson, the company had engaged the U.S. government on the matter and performed its own inquiry, without identifying \"any reason to believe products have been diverted.\" </p><p> \"NVIDIA visited multiple Megaspeed sites yet again earlier this week and confirmed what we previously observed—Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules,\" they said in a statement shared with CNBC Friday. </p><p>Megaspeed didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the U.S. Commerce Department. </p><p>The Times reported that Megaspeed, which spun off from a Chinese gaming company in 2023, bought nearly $2 billion worth of Nvidia's most advanced products through its subsidiary in Malaysia.</p></div><h2><a></a>Export loophole concerns </h2><div><p>The case surrounding Megaspeed highlights broader concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. export restrictions on advanced technologies, such as Nvidia's AI processors. </p><p>The U.S. government has, for years, restricted sales of advanced AI chips to China, citing concerns they could strengthen Beijing's military and give it an edge in broader AI development, among others. </p><p>But experts and lawmakers in Washington have long warned about loopholes in Washington's export controls, while reports indicate that a massive black market for smuggled Nvidia chips has also emerged. </p><p>The House Select Committee on China in April <a href=\"https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/moolenaar-krishnamoorthi-unveil-explosive-report-chinese-ai-firm-deepseek\" target=\"_blank\">questioned </a>Nvidia's shipment of chips to China and Southeast Asia after reports that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek used the company's chips to train a groundbreaking AI model.</p><p>Just a few months prior, Singapore had launched a separate probe into the alleged smuggling of restricted Nvidia chips, which were declared bound for Malaysia but may have been diverted elsewhere, including China.</p><p>In response to such cases and mounting U.S. pressure, Malaysia announced in July that it would begin requiring<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-says-trade-permit-required-ai-chips-us-origin-2025-07-14/\" target=\"_blank\"> permits</a> for all exports and transfers of Nvidia chips.</p></div><h2><a></a>Outsourcing to Southeast Asia?</h2><div><p>Chinese companies have also exploited a legal gray area by tapping into computing power from data centers in Southeast Asia equipped with restricted Nvidia chips, according to recent reports.</p><p>For example, Megaspeed was using its Nvidia chips for data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia, which appeared to be remotely serving customers in China, according to the Times.</p><p>Nvidia didn't directly address this claim, but said in its statement that the Trump administration's recent AI Action plan \"rightfully encourages businesses worldwide to embrace U.S. standards and U.S. leadership, benefiting national and economic security.\"</p></div><div><p><img

Action plan</a> also called for strengthening enforcement of export controls globally.</p><p>Lawmakers in Washington have also proposed bills that could see Nvidia required to outfit its chips with tracking systems.</p><p>Such proposals have received pushback from Beijing, which froze imports of Nvidia's chips after the Trump administration said it would roll back restrictions on some of the firm's chips made specifically for China.</p></div></div>",

The interviews will be led by Bessent and include two senior Treasury officials and two senior White House officials.</p><p>With Bessent focused on the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington next week and then traveling to Asia with President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> on an extended trip, the officials said the interview process might not be wrapped up until after Thanksgiving.</p><p>The secretary then intends to send a smaller list to Trump, who will make the final decision. It is likely, however, that this person will first be nominated to be a Fed governor and then nominated later to be Fed chair.</p><p>The reason is outgoing Fed Chair <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/\">Jerome Powell</a>, whose term ends in May, sits in a governor's seat that has only two years remaining. The seat of former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, now occupied by Stephen Miran, has a term that ends in January and would allow the new Fed chair to be nominated to a seat with a full 14-year governor's term.</p><p>But the officials said that strategy was not decided and there were other possibilities.</p><p>The president has already named Warsh, Hassett and Waller as finalists for the job, so only Rieder and Bowman would be new recommendations to the White House.</p></div><div><p>Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York City on Sept. 28, 2023.</p><p>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</p></div><div><p>Compared with previous administrations, the Trump administration has been running a more open process for the next Fed chair, announcing candidates <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/trump-considering-11-candidates-for-fed-chair-including-david-zervos-and-rick-rieder-sources-say.html\">as the list grows</a> and, now, shrinks.</p><p>At the same time, the administration, led by the president himself, has been highly critical of Fed policy, repeatedly urging it to lower rates sharply. The president had threatened to remove Powell and actually fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, accusations she denies.</p><p>Cook's firing has been blocked by lower courts, and the case <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/supreme-court-trump-fed-lisa-cook.html\">will be heard in January by the Supreme Court</a>. The attempts to oust Cook have raised concerns about the administration's commitment to Fed independence, raising the stakes for the new chair appointment and making it a closely followed decision.</p></div><h2><a></a>BlackRock's Rieder impresses</h2><div><p>The Treasury officials also for the first time provided some insight into Bessent's thinking about the criteria used to decide who to pick for the job.</p><p>Bessent is said to be seeking someone who is open to new ideas about how to run the Fed and monetary policy, and has experience in economics, monetary policy, banking regulation and management.</p><p>The secretary recently penned an essay sharply critical of the Fed and called for reviews of the central bank's policy, structure and mission.</p><p>Among his critiques was that the Fed had grown too big and experienced mission creep. That suggests he would prefer a candidate willing to pare down both the Fed's size and roll back its use of some tools, especially quantitative easing.</p><p>The officials said no candidate was leading the pack, but they confirmed recent reports that Rieder had impressed Bessent.</p><p>Rieder, a frequent guest on CNBC, has been a well-known fixture on Wall Street for years. His analysis of the fixed income market and the Fed are widely read. He also manages a large department at BlackRock. While not decisive, the officials suggested it could be a plus that Rieder, alone among the five remaining candidates, has never worked at the Fed.</p></div></div>",

At the time, the analysts expected the trade war and other external uncertainties would have pushed China to roll out stronger support for the real estate sector, Edward Chan, director, corporate ratings at S&P Global Ratings, told CNBC.</p><p>The main reason for the weaker outlook is that \"homebuyers' sentiment is still pretty fragile,\" Chan said. \"So the government will need to continue to support the sector and demand [to] help restore homebuyers' confidence.\"</p><p>In September 2024, Beijing called for efforts to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/chinas-top-leaders-call-for-halting-real-estate-decline.html\">\"halt\" the real estate decline</a> in a high-profile meeting.

This signals that Beijing isn't easing policy as aggressively as before, despite the property slump.</p><p>In August, three of China's largest cities eased purchase restrictions to allow buyers to hold multiple properties, but the move mostly applied to units in the less desirable city outskirts, S&P noted.</p><p>\"If demand can be stabilized first in the higher-tier cities, particularly in the first-tier [largest] cities first, that would probably help the trajectory of the demand recovery to be more sustainable,\" Chan said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Turnaround remains elusive</h2><div><p>For now, hopes of a bottom in China's real estate slump look even more distant.</p><p>With sales projected to be 9 trillion yuan or less this year, China's property market will have halved in just four years, from 18.2 trillion yuan in 2021, according to S&P. The ratings agency expects sales to fall by another 6% to 7% in 2026, with primary home prices down by 1.5% to 2.5%.</p><p>In past decades, homebuyers in China have tended to buy apartments ahead of completion. But as developers ran into financial difficulties, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/13/house-buyers-in-chinas-tianjin-have-been-waiting-8-years-for-their-homes.html\">construction was delayed</a>, shaking consumer confidence.

But instead of using it as her second home, the indictment alleges, she rented it to a family of three.</p><p>The indictment alleges that James' alleged total purported \"ill-gotten gains\" were only about $19,000 over the life of the loan she received. Most of that money was from savings James allegedly received from a lower interest rate on the mortgage than she would have had to pay if the home was classified as a rental investment property, the indictment says.</p><p>\"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" said<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/new-york-state-attorney-general-indicted\" target=\"_blank\"> Halligan</a> in a statement after she obtained the indictment in Alexandria federal court.</p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served,\" Halligan said.</p><p>James, in a statement, called the charges \"baseless\" and said, \"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.\"</p><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General.\"</p><p>Trump's \"own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost,\" James said. \"The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.\"</p><p>\"His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me – and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president – is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country. This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.\"</p><p>James was ordered to make her first appearance in the case on Oct. 24 in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia. The case was assigned to Judge Jamar Walker, who was appointed to the bench in 2023 by then-President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>If convicted, James faces a maximum possible sentence of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million on each count. Any actual sentence would likely be much less severe given federal sentencing guidelines.</p><p>Halligan, on Sept. 25 obtained a criminal indictment against Comey, on charges related to his allegedly lying to Congress in 2020.</p><p>Halligan personally presented the evidence in Comey's case, reportedly after other prosecutors balked at the idea. It is highly unusual for a U.S. Attorney to present a case to a grand jury.</p><p>Comey pleaded not guilty during a court appearance in Alexandria on Wednesday and was scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5.</p><p>Halligan's predecessor as acting U.S. Attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned on Sept. 19, shortly after Trump said he wanted him gone.</p><p>Siebert told Justice Department officials before he quit that \"investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey,\" The New York Times reported on the day he resigned.</p><p>Trump promptly tapped Halligan to replace Siebert.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the indictment of her fellow Democrat James.</p><p>\"New Yorkers know @NewYorkStateAG James for her integrity, her independence, and her relentless fight for justice,\" Hochul wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1976390804999721286\" target=\"_blank\">post on X.</a></p><p>\"What we're seeing today is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable,\" the governor wrote.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, \"This is what tyranny looks like.</p><p>\"President Trump is using the Justice Department as his personal attack dog, targeting Attorney General Tish James for the 'crime' of prosecuting him for fraud — and winning,\" Schumer said. \"One U.S. Attorney already refused this case. So, Trump hand-picked an unqualified hack that would go after another political enemy. This isn't justice. It's revenge. And it should horrify every American who believes no one is above the law.\"</p><p>James' indictment comes three days after MSNBC reported that a top prosecutor in Halligan's office, Elizabeth Yusi, was resisting pressure to ask a grand jury to charge James.</p><p>\"Yusi ... has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC,\" that report on Monday said.</p><p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, in April, made a criminal referral against James with the U.S. Justice Department, saying she had, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records in connection with the Norfolk home.</p><p>James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, in a statement Thursday to NBC News, said, \"Attorney General James flatly and forcefully denies these charges.\"</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,\" Lowell said. \"When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone – when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted -- it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. We will fight these charges in every process allowed in the law.\"</p><p>Pulte has made similar accusations about purported mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>Trump cited those claims in August when he tried to fire Cook, who, like James, is the first Black woman to hold her position. A federal district court judge blocked Trump from removing Cook while her lawsuit challenging her termination was pending.</p><p>The Supreme Court on Oct. 1 said Cook could remain in her post pending the outcome of oral arguments over the dispute, which are set for January.</p><p>Cook, who is being represented in her lawsuit by Lowell, has not been criminally charged.</p><p>In early September, James asked New York state's highest court to overturn an appeals court's decision tossing out the $500 million penalty imposed on Trump and his company in the business fraud case.</p><p><em>\"</em>I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization,\" James said in her statement on Thursday.</p><p>\"We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence – not politics,\" she said. \"Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.\"</p><p>\"I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space,\" James said.</p><p>\"And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.\"</p></div>",

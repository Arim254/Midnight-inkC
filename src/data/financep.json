John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesShares of South Korea's largest defense firm Hanwha Aerospace plunged more than 6% Tuesday, after the company reported worse than expected numbers for its fourth quarter revenue and pre-tax profit on Monday. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 72.56% year on year to 8.33 trillion South Korean won, but missed LSEG estimates of 8.64 trillion won. Pre-tax profit plunged 72% to 602 billion won, a massive miss compared to expectations of 1.2 trillion won, while the company's operating profit dipped 16% to 753 billion won. Net profit was a bright spot, coming in above expectations despite a 54% decline at 934 billion won. LSEG estimates had pegged net profit at 717.20 billion won. Full year numbers Annual revenue skyrocketed 137% year on year to hit 26.61 trillion South Korean won, but marginally missed estimates of 27.01 trillion won. Pre-tax profit fell slightly to 2.15 trillion won, down 19% from the same period a year ago and missing expectations of 2.73 trillion.Hanwha had logged its fourth consecutive year of record operating profits, while net profit numbers beat expectations. Operating profit rose 75% year on year to 3.03 trillion won, while net profit declined 16% year on year to 2.14 trillion won, beating expectations of 1.65 trillion won. Share gainsOn an year-to-date basis, Hanwha shares have climbed 18.92%, following a blistering rally in 2025 which saw shares climb 193%, on top of a 154% jump in 2024. Hanwha is the 11th largest stock on the Kospi, with a market cap of about $42.03 billion.The company has seen demand for its defense platforms grow after the Russia-Ukraine War, with orders from multiple European countries. Since 2022, Hanwha has sold its K9 Thunder self propelled howitzer to Poland, Estonia, Romania and Norway, as well as its Chunmoo multiple launch rocket systems.  ",

    "body": "A pedestrian walks by a CVS store in Greenbrae, California, on July 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesCVS Health on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates and reaffirmed the 2026 profit guidance that impressed investors, signaling steady progress in the health-care giant's turnaround plan. \"'24 was a tough year for the company. So '25 righted the ship,\" CVS CFO Brian Newman said in an interview. CVS, which operates one of the largest pharmacy chains in the U.S., sees full-year profit coming in between $7 to $7.20 per share. That's in line with the $7.17 per share that analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. Newman also said the company is maintaining its 2026 revenue guidance of at least $400 billion. Analysts expect revenue of $409.77 billion, according to LSEG, though it's unclear if those estimates account for all of the headwinds Newman cited. He said that guidance includes $20 billion in headwinds, roughly half of which is driven by the company's move to exit the Affordable Care Act individual exchange market this year. Newman said the other half reflects the company's retail business adjusting to lower drug prices after the \"most favored nation\" deals that President Donald Trump struck with more than a dozen pharma companies in recent months. CVS last week said its roughly 9,000 pharmacies are accepting discount cards from the president's newly launched direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, for eligible patients. Newman said CVS shares the Trump administration's goal of reducing costs. He added that the lower prices set a new starting point from which Caremark, the company's pharmacy benefit manager, can negotiate even lower costs for its clients, \"so we don't see these as kind of adversarial relationships.\" CVS previously said it expects growth this year to be driven by the return to target margins at its recovering Aetna insurance business, led by privately run Medicare Advantage plans, and Caremark. Newman added that primary-care provider Oak Street Health is \"improving its profitability\" this year. That comes after CVS moved to close 16 underperforming Oak Street locations. For the retail pharmacy business, Newman said the company has several tailwinds, such as new technological investments and the locations and new customers CVS acquired from Rite Aid last year after it filed for bankruptcy. Investors rewarded CVS last year as CEO David Joyner, who stepped into the role in late 2024, pressed ahead with a sweeping restructuring aimed at reversing years of underperformance. The company has cut costs, reshuffled leadership and exited weaker markets, helping fuel a roughly 40% stock rise over the past year.Here's what CVS reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.09 adjusted vs. 99 cents expectedRevenue: $105.69 billion vs. $103.59 billion expectedThe company posted net income of $2.92 billion, or $2.30 per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $1.62 billion, or $1.30 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, such as restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $1.09 per share for the quarter.CVS booked sales of $105.69 billion for the fourth quarter, up 8.2% from the same period a year ago, as all three of its business segments showed growth. Growth across business unitsThe insurance business brought in $36.29 billion in revenue during the quarter, up more than 10% from the fourth quarter of 2024. Newman said the unit delivered a \"very strong\" quarter and that he expects another year of margin improvement, primarily driven by Medicare Advantage. The company's business for those privately run Medicare plans is \"continuing the path towards target margins\" of 3% to 4% by 2028, he said. Aetna and other insurers have grappled with higher-than-expected medical costs over the past year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. While medical costs remain high, Aetna and other insurers, such as UnitedHealthcare, appear to be becoming better equipped to navigate the issue moving forward.Still, Newman said \"we will continue the elevated trends. ... I don't think it's too early to assume anything other than a prudent outlook.\"The insurance segment's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — remained consistent from the prior year, at 94.8%. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.Newman said the biggest driver of that ratio in the fourth quarter was Medicaid pass-through payments that hit in late December. In a release, CVS also said improved performance in the unit's government business was offset by shifts in Medicare drug cost timing following changes under the Inflation Reduction Act, which altered the usual seasonal pattern of prescription spending.Last month, shares of Medicare Advantage insurers took a hit in January after the Trump administration proposed nearly flat government payment rates to those plans in 2027. Newman said he does not believe that the proposed rate reflects medical cost trends. CVS has started a dialogue with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before the agency finalizes the rate notice in the beginning of April, he added. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division posted $37.66 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, up 12.4% from the same period a year earlier.CVS said the increase came partly from higher prescription volume, including from the company's acquisition of prescriptions from Rite Aid, but was offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of some generic drugs entering the market. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing.CVS' health services segment generated $51.24 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 9% compared with the same quarter in 2024. That unit includes Caremark, which negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance, and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions.",

    "body": "Cases of Coca-Cola brand soda are stacked at a Costco Wholesale store on November 13, 2025 in Simi Valley, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesCoca-Cola on Tuesday reported mixed quarterly results, although demand for its drinks in North America and Latin America is beginning to show signs of improvement.Looking ahead to 2026, the company is projecting organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% for the full year.Shares of Coca-Cola fell roughly 3% in premarket trading. Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Adjusted earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 56 cents expectedAdjusted revenue: $11.82 billion vs. $12.03 billion expected The beverage giant reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $2.27 billion, or 53 cents per share, up from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding transaction gains and other one-times items, Coke earned 58 cents per share.Net sales rose 2% to $11.82 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and currency, increased 5% in the quarter.Unit case volume rose 1% in the quarter, marking the second straight quarter of growth for the company. The metric excludes the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand. Like rival PepsiCo, Coke has seen demand for its drinks fall as budget-conscious shoppers try to save more on their grocery bills and dine out less frequently. Coke's overall volume for 2025 was unchanged from the prior year. But there have been some bright spots, like Smartwater and Fairlife, showing that consumers are still willing to pay more for premium drinks. And two key markets for Coke are starting to show signs of improvement. Coke's volume in North America increased 1%, while it rose 2% in Latin America. Worldwide, Coke's water, sports, coffee and tea division outperformed the rest of its portfolio, signaling consumers' willingness to spend on drinks they perceive as healthier options. The segment saw volume grow 3%, thanks to higher demand for brands like Smartwater and Bodyarmor. The company's sparkling soft drinks business reported flat volume. Its namesake soda saw volume rise 1% in the quarter, while Coke Zero Sugar reported that its volume climbed 13%.Coke's juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages division reported that volume fell 3%. Higher demand for Fairlife was offset by the sale of Coke's finished product operations in Nigeria to one of its bottlers.Shares of Coca-Cola have risen roughly 22% over the last year as of Monday's close, raising its market value up to about $335 billion.",

    "body": "watch nowTarget said Monday that it's stepping up store staffing, but eliminating about 500 jobs at distribution centers and regional offices as it tries to win back shoppers who have complained about sloppier shelves, out-of-stock items and longer checkout lines.In an internal employee memo obtained by CNBC, the big-box retailer said it's making changes to the way it runs and oversees stores to improve the customer experience, a top goal of new CEO Michael Fiddelke. To do that, Target said it will reduce the number of store districts — the geographic areas that its nearly 2,000 stores are broken into, which have dedicated staffing — and put money toward more hours for front-line store employees.As part of the changes, Target is laying off around 500 people, including about 100 at the store district level and about 400 across its supply chain sites, the internal email said.\"This change also fuels our ability to put significantly more payroll in our stores — primarily in additional labor and hours where needed most, but also in new guest experience training for every team member at every store,\" the email said. The email was written by Adrienne Costanzo, chief stores officer, and Gretchen McCarthy, chief supply chain and logistics officer, and sent to Target employees across its headquarters and store field teams on Monday afternoon.A Target spokesperson declined to specify the amount of additional investment planned for Target stores, but said the announcement will not change starting wages for store workers, which range from $15 to $24 per hour depending on the location. Read moreFor Target, the organizational shift marks one of the first changes under Fiddelke, formerly the company's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, who stepped into the top job on Feb. 1. Fiddelke took the helm as the company aims to get back to growth. Its annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and it cut 1,800 corporate roles last year in its first major layoff in a decade. Customers, vendors and investors say the company had gotten weaker in some of the key areas where it used to stand out. For example, some shoppers said Target had lost its edge with attentive customer service and trendy, fashion-forward merchandise that earned the company its \"Tarzhay\" nickname.The company has also faced backlash and boycotts from customers over a string of political and social stances over the past few years, including its decision to sell and then pull some Pride Month merchandise, its embrace of and reversal of major diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and, most recently, for not speaking out against the surge of immigration enforcement in its hometown of Minneapolis. Along with Target's self-inflicted struggles, the company has faced stiffer competition from peers like Walmart and a tougher economic backdrop. Consumers have been more selective in recent years about discretionary purchases and impulse items — Target's sweet spot — while paying more for necessities like groceries and rent. In an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters in October, Fiddelke said his leading priorities as CEO would be restoring Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology to speed along the business.Yet he added that Target needs to simplify an operation that's become more complicated for store managers and store employees in recent years as they not only stock shelves, but also pick orders for curbside pickup or packing cardboard boxes headed to customers' homes.\"If you're a store manager now, yes, you're supporting your in-store guest, and you're also running a fulfillment business that's gotten pretty big,\" he said in the October interview. \"And I think we're just now fully appreciating, 'All right, we've got to make sure that we're doing both really well, and it's more complex than it used to be.'\"Last year, the company made another store-related change to try to clean up and smooth over its operations. Almost all of Target's online orders are fulfilled in stores, which has taken up more of employees' time and stores' back rooms. In response, the company shook up its online strategy, designating some stores as locations where employees pick and pack online orders to ship to customers' homes and dropping that altogether at other locations.Target is expected to share more details about its turnaround strategy, along with its holiday-quarter results and full-year forecast, on March 3. It will host an event for investors at its Minneapolis headquarters. ",

    "body": "Trowbridge in Somerset, England, on March 15, 2025.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBritish oil giant BP on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter profit in line with expectations and suspended share buybacks, seeking to shore up its balance sheet as lower crude prices take their toll.The London-listed energy firm reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.54 billion for the final three months of 2025. That matched analyst expectations of $1.54 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.BP's full-year 2025 net profit came in at $7.49 billion, missing analyst expectations of $7.58 billion. That's down from nearly $9 billion in 2024. BP said the board decided to suspend the share buyback and fully allocate excess cash \"to accelerate strengthening\" of its balance sheet. The firm's previous buyback was $750 million and was announced alongside third-quarter results in November.  For the fourth quarter, the company announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8.320 cents.\"2025 was a year of strong underlying financial results, strong operational performance, and meaningful strategic progress,\" Carol Howle, BP interim CEO, said in a statement.\"We have made progress against our four primary targets - growing cash flow and returns, reducing costs, and strengthening the balance sheet - but know there is more work to be done, and we are clear on the urgency to deliver,\" she added.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill is scheduled to take the reins at BP on April 1, following Murray Auchincloss' decision to step down late last year.Shares of BP fell 5.4% during morning deals, slipping toward the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.Some other earnings highlights included:BP's fourth-quarter net debt came in at $22.18 billion, down from around $23 billion in the same period last year.Fourth-quarter operating cash flow came in at $7.6 billion, up from $7.43 billion a year ago.BP set its 2026 capital expenditure budget at $13 billion to $13.5 billion, reflecting the lower end of its guidance range. The results come at a tough time for Europe's oil and gas sector. Oil prices notched their biggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemic last year, partly due to oversupply concerns, ratcheting up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to shareholder returns. BP's industry rivals Equinor and Shell both reported weaker quarterly earnings last week, citing lower crude prices, among other factors.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBP, Equinor and Shell shares year-to-dateEquinor announced it would reduce share buybacks to $1.5 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, while also trimming investments in its renewables and low-emission energy projects. Shell, for its part, kept its buybacks steady at $3.5 billion, a move that marked the firm's 17th consecutive quarter of $3 billion or more in buybacks.",

    "body": "Sebastian Lai, son of Jimmy Lai speaks during a press conference outside Downing street in London on Sept. 15, 2025. Henry Nicholls | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's embassy in London on Tuesday criticized the U.K.'s decision to expand a visa program for Hong Kong residents, calling the move an interference in its internal affairs after a court sentenced pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison under a national security law. The U.K. on Monday expanded the British National Overseas, or BNO, visa scheme on Monday to allow children of BNO status holders — who were under 18 at the time of Hong Kong's handover to mainland China in June 1997 — to apply for the route independently of their parents.  \"BNO has misled Hong Kong residents to leave their homes, only to face discrimination and hardship in the U.K., living as second-class citizens,\" an embassy spokesperson said in a statement in Chinese translated by CNBC.The embassy described the scheme expansion as \"despicable\" and \"reprehensible.\"\"China has always firmly opposed the UK's manipulation and interference in China's internal affairs,\" the embassy spokesperson said.The scheme was launched in 2021 after Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law on Hong Kong. Since then, more than 230,000 people have been granted visas, and almost 170,000 have relocated to the U.K. The diplomatic tensions followed the sentencing of Lai by a Hong Kong court on Monday, in one of the city's most prominent prosecutions. That was the heaviest penalty ever meted out under the national security law. The 78-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper was a vocal critic of Beijing and was among the first prominent figures arrested in August 2020. He was jailed on charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and publishing seditious materials. Lai pleaded not guilty to all counts.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing last month, calling for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. Critics and Lai's family have argued that the U.K. did not take sufficient and concrete steps to reverse the course.The sentencing showed how the Beijing-imposed national security law has \"criminalised dissent, prompting many to leave the territory,\" the British government said in a statement, adding it will \"rapidly engage [with Beijing] further on Mr Lai's case.\"  The expanded visa route came amid what the British government described as a \"deterioration of rights and freedoms\" in Hong Kong. The government estimated that 26,000 people will arrive in the U.K. over the next five years.   Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, said Tuesday that Lai deserved the harsh sentencing for all the harm that he had done, including \"using Apple Daily to poison the minds of citizens\" and \"colluding with foreign forces to take sanctions and hostile actions against China and Hong Kong.\"Other governments have renewed calls for Lai's release following the ruling. Marco Rubio, U.S. secretary of State, called the ruling \"unjust and tragic\" and urged the authorities to grant humanitarian parole for Lai. ",

    "body": "From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump, in a call two decades ago to a Florida police chief, bashed his former friend Jeffrey Epstein and called Epstein's  procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell, \"evil,\" the now-retired cop recounted to FBI agents in 2019, according to a document released by the Department of Justice.Trump called the then-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter \"to tell him 'thank goodness you' [are] stopping [Epstein], everyone has known he's been doing this,\" Reiter told the FBI in October 2019, according to the FBI document, known as a 302. Reiter's name is redacted from the 302. But the document identifies the interview subject as the person who had been Palm Beach's police chief at the time of the department's investigation of Epstein, who was Reiter.Reiter told the Miami Herald, which first reported the document, that Trump called him in 2006, after the police department's probe of Epstein became publicly known.The document came to light hours after Maxwell's lawyer called on Trump to grant her executive clemency, so that she could speak \"honestly\" about what she knows. Maxwell, earlier Monday, refused to testify to a House committee.Trump told Reiter that he had thrown Epstein out of his club, Mar-a-Lago, which is located in Palm Beach, the summary said.\"Trump told him [Reiter] people in New York knew Epstein was disgusting,\" according to the FBI's 302 summary of its interview with Reiter.\"Trump said Maxwell was Epstein's operative, 'she is evil and to focus on her,' \" the FBI said in the 302.U.S. President Donald Trump sits behind a bill he signed to end the partial government shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 3, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEpstein later pleaded guilty to Florida state charges in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, in exchange for avoiding federal criminal prosecution.Reiter's interview with the FBI in October 2019 came two months after Epstein killed himself in a New York federal jail after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.During the 2006 call, \"Trump told [Reiter] that he was around Epstein once when teenagers were present and Trump got the hell out of there,\" the summary said.\"Trump was one of the very first people to call when people found out that they were investigating Epstein,\" the summary said.In an April 2019 email released last year by House Democrats, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls,\" according to a copy of that message purportedly between the two men.It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.The White House in November said, \"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees.\"The White House, when asked for comment on Monday night by CNBC about the FBI summary, referred questions to the Department of Justice.The DOJ said, \"We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the President contacted law enforcement 20 years ago.\"The summary is among millions of documents made public by the DOJ in late January that are related to Epstein and to Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to sexually abuse.Ghislaine Maxwell and Donald Trump are shown in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 23, 2025 as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. U.S. Justice Department | Via ReutersMaxwell on Monday appeared virtually before the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the Epstein case, but refused to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Her attorney, David Oscar Marcus, in a statement, said that Maxwell is willing to \"speak fully and honestly\" if Trump grants her executive clemency. Clemency can include a pardon, which would wipe away Maxwell's conviction, or commuting her sentence to allow her release from prison earlier than scheduled.\"Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,\" Marcus said. \"For example, both President Trump and President [Bill] Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.\"Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have been subpoenaed to testify to the Oversight Committee about Epstein. They are scheduled to be deposed there in late February.",

    "body": "In an aerial view, two-story single family homes line the streets on Jan. 14, 2026 in Thousand Oaks, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHouse lawmakers on Monday approved a package of bills aimed at increasing housing affordability by giving builders and local governments incentives to boost construction by reducing regulations around home construction. The legislation gained strong bipartisan support, with the House voting 390-9 in favor. A similar Senate counterpart passed last year, also with bipartisan votes. That, as well as President Donald Trump's focus on housing affordability, means the measure has momentum to become law before the end of the year. \"Nothing's more personal to Americans than their opportunity to have a home,\" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told reporters on Monday. \"When you ask people what is central to their goals in life, mom and dad are working 55 hours a week and overtime and all these other things ... the idea is, how do we get into a house?\"The bill includes numerous provisions, including cutting housing and environmental regulations around constructing homes. Local communities could get grants to make it easier for builders by offering pre-reviewed housing designs, streamlining construction or housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also develop best-practices for zoning guidelines. Definitions around manufactured and modular housing would be updated to encourage more factory-built homes, which can be constructed in a fraction of the time compared to more traditional house-building methods.Community banks would also get a boost through the bill. One change would allow banks to take more custodial and reciprocal deposits, which could help banks provide more mortgages for potential homeowners. Other changes would make it easier to start new banks and change how the FDIC looks at banking mergers. The Senate bill doesn't include many of the provisions on community banks, and would create more programs compared to the House bill. The Senate passed its package last year as part of a larger defense measure, but the bill got significant bipartisan support as a standalone measure, including the backing of both Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.The bills have received an unusually high degree of bipartisan support. The Senate bill was advanced unanimously out of committee with all 24 senators supporting it. A House panel advanced its bill 50 to 1 in December.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who supported the bill, warned the legislation wouldn't be effective if housing programs remain underfunded.\"Policy reforms alone are not enough,\" Waters said. \"These programs must be funded if they are going to work.\"House Financial Services Chair French Hill, R-Ark., said getting a housing bill across the finish line is a \"shared goal\" between him and Scott. Hill said he will work with the Senate to see where they have common ground and get consensus on a bill that can get to Trump's desk. Flood said he is optimistic on getting passage this year. \"We are at a juncture to get something very big done here, and everybody wants to participate,\" he said. \"This isn't like we're pushing an agenda trying to talk people into something. White House has ideas. The Senate has ideas. The House has ideas.\"One thing not in the bill: formalizing Trump's proposed ban on large investors buying homes. Hill noted other lawmakers have introduced bills building on Trump's idea and said it could happen if there is a consensus in the Senate and House. ",

The app will operate under the umbrella of Donalson's company, Beast Industries. \"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That's exactly why we're joining forces with Step,\" MrBeast told his millions of fans on Monday. \"I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had. Lots to share soon.\"Beast Industries did not disclose how much it paid for Step.

In his short LinkedIn post, Jegannathan wrote, \"The journey at Tesla has been one of continuous evolution.\"Last year, Jegannathan was tasked with leading the electric vehicle maker's sales team after previous North America sales leader Troy Jones was dismissed.

Tesla's revenue for 2025 dropped 3%, declining for the first time on record.

    "body": "watch nowThe Food and Drug Administration said Novo Nordisk's TV advertisement for its newly launched Wegovy pill for obesity included \"false or misleading\" claims about the medicine's abilities and benefits to patients.In a letter to Novo dated Feb. 5, the FDA said the ad misbrands the oral drug, making its distribution a violation of federal law. The agency requested that the drugmaker take immediate action to address the violations, which could include ceasing all ads containing misleading claims. In a statement Monday, Novo Nordisk confirmed that it received the letter and clarified that the ad has been running since the pill's launch, but is not the company's Super Bowl spot. \"We take all regulatory feedback seriously and are in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns regarding the advertisement's presentation,\" Liz Skrbkova, Novo's head of U.S. media and stakeholder relations, said in the statement. It adds to the mounting hurdles the Danish drugmaker is facing as it scrambles to win back market share from chief rival Eli Lilly and cheaper compounded copycats in the booming GLP-1 market. The company's Wegovy pill is key to those efforts. It was the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity to enter the market in January, and Novo last week said more than 170,000 American patients are already taking the drug. Bloomberg first reported on the FDA letter on Monday.

The agency said phrases used in the spot, including \"live lighter\" and \"a way forward,\" imply greater weight loss than other treatments and added benefits beyond that, despite no evidence to support those claims. The ad's statements \"misleadingly imply benefits beyond physical weight loss such as emotional relief, reduced psychological burden, hope, or direction for patients' lives, positioning the drug as a solution to broader life challenges rather than a treatment for a specific condition, when this has also not been demonstrated,\" the FDA said in the letter. The FDA also flagged the ad for failing to properly present risk information in both audio and text, a requirement for television drug advertising. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk sued Hims & Hers, asking the court to stop the telehealth company from mass marketing compounded versions of its Wegovy pill and injections. ",

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTaiwan has told Washington that its proposal to move 40% of the island's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. was \"impossible,\" Taipei's top tariff trade negotiator said in an interview. Speaking on a local television broadcast Sunday, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said she had made it clear to Washington that the country's semiconductor ecosystem, built over decades, could not simply be relocated. Taiwan's international expansion, including its investments in the U.S., is predicated on the notion that the industry remains' rooted in Taiwan and continues to expand domestic investments, she said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. The comments push back against onshoring targets outlined by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a CNBC interview in January, shortly after the latest U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement. Lutnick said he wanted 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain to shift to the U.S. within President Donald Trump's ongoing term. Under the deal, the Taiwanese government promised $250 billion in direct investments by its tech companies, with an additional $250 billion in credit provided for them to expand their production capacity in the U.S. Washington on its part lowered levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, waived tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically, and promised higher quotas for tariff-free exports of Taiwanese chips to the U.S. watch nowTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's leading contract chipmaker and producer of the most advanced semiconductors, has already been working to better align with U.S. policy interests.The company has committed more than $65 billion to U.S. manufacturing in recent years, with plans to expand that to $165 billion, as it produces chips for American clients Apple and Nvidia. The investments have also leveraged grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. But according to Lutnick, Washington is also looking for hundreds of other smaller companies in the chip supply chain to come to the U.S. \"We're going to build giant semiconductor industrial parks in America ... This is a $500 billion down payment on let's bring those semiconductors home,\" he said in January, adding that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff Trump has threatened against the sector. However, semiconductor analysts broadly agree with Cheng's assessment that Washington's most ambitious onshoring plans are unfeasible, citing the difficulties of relocating such an advanced supply chain.Analysts and industry officials point to Taiwan's deeply integrated semiconductor ecosystem, U.S. labor shortages and elevated costs as some of the key obstacles.Geopolitical analysts have also pointed to the so-called \"Silicon Shield\" theory, which posits that the island's pivotal role in global chip supply makes safeguarding its autonomy a U.S. strategic imperative, deterring a potential Chinese aggression. Beijing claims sovereignty over the democratically governed island.This Silicon Shield could further discourage Taiwan from shifting its supply chains abroad. Taiwanese authorities have already implemented a policy requiring TSMC's overseas plants to operate using technologies at least two generations behind the cutting-edge ones being deployed in Taiwan, a policy often referred to as the N-2 rule. The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cheng's statement. TSMC shares were trading up 2.75% in Taiwan on Tuesday. — CNBC's Matthew Chin contributed to this report.

    "body": "A man walks past the Alibaba logo displayed at its booth during the China International Supply Chain Expo in Beijing, China July 16, 2025. Florence Lo | ReutersAlibaba on Tuesday launched an artificial intelligence model designed to power robotics, as more tech giants push into the fast-growing field.The model, called RynnBrain, is designed to help robots comprehend the physical world around them and identify objects. One video released by Alibaba's DAMO Academy shows a robot identifying fruit and putting it in a basket. While these tasks seem simple, they involve complex AI that governs a robot's understanding of individual items as well as movement. Robotics falls under the umbrella term dubbed \"physical AI,\" which includes machines that rely on artificial intelligence, such as self-driving cars – an area China has prioritized as it competes with the U.S. for technological leadership.watch nowNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been among the tech industry's most bullish on the sector and last year said AI and robotics represent \"a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity.\"For Alibaba, the RynnBrain model gives it an entry point into the robotics market and continues the momentum it has seen with its Qwen family of AI models that are among the most advanced coming out of China.Alibaba is not alone in creating models designed for physical AI. These AI \"world models\" are being developed by tech giants around the world. Nvidia has a number of models to train and run AI in robotics under the \"Cosmos\" brand, while Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is Google DeepMind's own version. Elon Musk, one of the biggest proponents of robotics, is designing his own AI with Tesla's Optimus. When it comes to humanoid robots specifically, the machines designed to walk and move like humans, China is seen as forging ahead of the U.S., with companies planning to ramp up production this year. Like its other models, Alibaba is pursuing an open source strategy with RynnBrain, meaning developers can use it for free. Open-sourcing models has been key for Alibaba to expand the use of its models to developers around the world. ",

    "body": "An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) speed boat sailing along the Persian Gulf near a cargo vessel.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesU.S.-flagged ships have been advised to stay \"as far as possible\" from Iranian waters when navigating the Strait of Hormuz as tensions between Washington and Tehran remain elevated.In a notice issued Monday, the U.S. Maritime Administration said ship captains should decline permission for Iranian forces to board U.S. vessels.Boarding attempts, including moves to force commercial vessels into Iranian waters through small boats and helicopters, have occured as recently as Feb. 3, the agency under the Department of Transportation said.Should Iranian forces board a U.S.-flagged commercial vessel, crews were advised not to \"forcibly resist the boarding party,\" the notice said. It added that refraining from forcible resistance does not imply consent or agreement to that boarding.The advisory recommended that ships transiting eastbound in the Strait of Hormuz stay close to the Omani side of the waterway.The guidance followed a round of indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran held in Oman on Friday, centered on how to approach discussions over Tehran's nuclear program. The meeting marked the first talks between the two countries since U.S. bombers struck three Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war with Iran last June.  Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian described the talks as \"a step forward,\" while signaling they would be the opening stage of a longer diplomatic process rather than a path to a quick resolution. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\"President Donald Trump said the Oman talks were \"very good\" and that more sessions were planned, even as he warned Iran that failure to reach a deal would carry \"very steep\" consequences for Iran.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Trump in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the U.S.-Iran talks. Israel, a close U.S. ally, has lobbied Washington to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, curb its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups in the region.watch nowThe Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway connecting the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, has returned to the spotlight this year after Trump warned of possible military action against Tehran.About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, according to data from market intelligence Kpler, accounting for nearly a third of global seaborne crude flows. Any disruption to those flows would ripple through global energy markets. Iran has in the past threatened to close the Strait during past confrontations, raising the prospect of higher oil prices.

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel in the island nation due to fuel shortages after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil.Cuba's leadership said Sunday that the country will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, which cited two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected.Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat,\" which required a national emergency declaration. Read moreThe U.S. president said Cuba's ties to countries including China, Russia and Iran, human rights violations and communist leadership destabilize the region \"through migration and violence.\" As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provide any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. Russia: Fuel situation in Cuba is 'critical'Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was \"truly critical\" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We know this. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.Pedestrians walk past the Habana Libre hotel, formerly the Habana Hilton, in Havana on Feb. 2, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the \"strongest possible terms.\"In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to \"blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba.\"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her government would aim to send humanitarian aid to Cuba from Monday, adding that the country is working to find a diplomatic solution to resume oil shipments to the Caribbean island.Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration.watch now",

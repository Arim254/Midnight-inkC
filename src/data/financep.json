    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Engagement season is upon us, with December being the most popular month to propose worldwide, according to The Knot.And while traditionally men have been expected to shell out for that diamond — as Beyoncé put it in 2008, he should've \"put a ring on it\" — many women are changing their expectations around who makes the purchase. Nearly 71% (70.6%) of women say they're willing to contribute to the cost of their engagement ring, according to DatingAdvice.com's recent Holiday Engagement Survey of 1,000 partnered U.S. adults.Almost 19% said they would pay for the ring in full, about 23% said they'd partially pay and 29% said they would contribute if needed. Here's why Natassia Miller, a certified sexologist who founded the sex and relationship coaching company Wonderlust, thinks women might be changing their tune. There are more dual-income couples these daysThere are more couples earning two salaries, with or without kids, than there were a decade ago, according to the Pew Research Center.And while, on average, the gender wage gap persists, there are some metro areas in the U.S. where women under the age of 30 earn as much as or more than their male counterparts, according to Pew. \"Today, with more dual‑income couples and women delaying marriage while they build careers,\" says Miller, \"there's more openness to treating the ring as a shared investment.\"Some 'couples are more pragmatic'This piece of jewelry is expensive: The average cost of an engagement ring is $5,200, according to The Knot.And headlines abound about Americans' financial hardships. Overall prices are up 25% since January 2020, for example, according to Consumer Price Index data, and nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, according to a recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma.\"Against that backdrop, it makes sense that couples are more pragmatic,\" says Miller. \"Instead of one partner taking on debt to hit an arbitrary ring budget, some women would rather share the cost and keep the purchase aligned with reality.​\"It's a 'public symbol' that says 'someone committed to me'Finally, even as they consider their financial realities, women are willing to pay because the ring is symbolic.\"Even women who are financially independent often grew up on a steady diet of rom‑coms, social media proposals, and bridal marketing where the ring is framed as proof of worthiness and desirability,\" says Miller.For many women, \"an engagement ring is still a public symbol that says, 'Someone committed to me, and is willing to show that to the world.'\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "When I think back on my childhood, my happiest memories aren't tied to things I owned. They're about the freedom of growing up in a small Ohio town where everyone knew your name and kids ran in packs.The neighborhood park was our meeting place. A few bikes tossed in a friend's front yard signaled the game was on. There were no texts or group chats. But childhood today often looks different. Connection revolves around gaming consoles, phones, sneakers, and the next must-have gadget. If you can't afford it, you risk being left out.That contrast led me to talk to my 79-year-old dad, a man who wears thriftiness the way others wear luxury. He genuinely enjoys finding new ways to save money. He never tried to keep up with anyone. While others rushed to buy the newest car or gadget, he was content with what he had. That mindset made him the quintessential millionaire next door.He helped shaped my relationship with money. I don't feel compelled to chase status or possessions. Here are eight lessons from my frugal dad that have stood the test of time — and how they still apply today.1. Let your values guide your financial decisionsEvery dollar you spend is a vote for the life you want to build. When your spending aligns with what matters most, money feels less like sacrifice and more like purpose. For couples especially, shared values turn financial decisions into a source of clarity instead of conflict.2. You can always earn more money, but not timeImagine you could swap places with legendary investor Warren Buffett, now 95. Would you? Time is scarce and unrecoverable, unlike money. Remember this when deciding whether to take a promotion just for a bigger paycheck, even if it means less time with family; or working longer hours for a fancier car when your current one works fine; or buying a bigger house when your kids already attend a great school in a safe neighborhood.3. The best investment you can make is in yourselfThe returns on personal growth compound for decades. Education, learning a new skill, reading widely, or even investing in therapy can strengthen both your earning potential and your resilience. In a partnership, personal growth benefits everyone — stronger individuals make stronger teams.4. Debt steals tomorrow’s optionsEvery borrowed dollar limits future freedom. A loan may feel manageable today, but it quietly shapes your choices tomorrow, from the jobs you can take to where you can live. Prioritizing flexibility over financing buys peace of mind and the ability to pivot when life changes.5. Turn off the lights when you leave the roomTurning the lights off is a metaphor for the small things we do. It’s more than about saving a few cents on electricity; it’s a mindfulness practice. Every small act of frugality adds up, and it builds awareness of how we use our resources. 6. Celebrate simplicityA quiet life is often an intentional one. Choosing simplicity means choosing time over things, presence over pressure, and meaning over noise. Less clutter often leads to less stress — and more room for what actually matters.7. New cars destroy wealthThe average new car now sells for over $50,000, and when you factor in financing, fuel, and insurance, monthly costs can exceed $1,200. Vehicles that are about three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability. Investing the difference between new and used can significantly boost long-term net worth.8. Being cheap and being frugal aren’t the same thingCheapness cuts corners at all costs. Frugality focuses on getting value for your money. A frugal person maintains what they own, spends intentionally, and is generous where it counts. Understanding that difference can prevent endless money conflicts because frugality builds a meaningful life, while cheapness slowly erodes joy.Brian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "As a relationship counselor with over 10 years of experience, I've learned that even the strongest couples face conflict. What sets emotionally intelligent couples apart is their ability to stay connected, even when disagreements arise.I'm often more concerned about couples who never fight, because avoiding conflict entirely can hide unresolved hurts. After all, the closer you are, the more likely ruptures are to happen, and how you handle them matters.Here are three things emotionally intelligent couples do differently when they are in conflict.1. They don't assume the worst about their partner's intentWe've all been there. One sharp comment can seem like an attack on your character. For example, you forget to text back and it is interpreted as not caring. A request for space could be misconstrued as abandonment.Research shows that when couples are distressed, they're more likely to interpret a partner's behavior in ways that make it feel intentional, fixed, and personal (\"you did this because you're that kind of person\"). Psychologists call this \"negative attribution bias.\"Before conflicts devolve into defensiveness and character attacks, I give my clients a simple exercise.Write down what you want to say. For example, \"Why do you shut down every time I bring something up?\" Then cross out every sentence that diagnoses your partner's motives (\"you don't care,\" \"you're trying to…,\" \"you always…\").Next, try a reframe. Write down the observable behavior, its impact on you, and one clear, workable request: \"When you go silent in moments like this, I start filling in the gaps on my own. I tell myself you don't care or that I've done something wrong, and I feel alone pretty quickly. What would really help is just hearing where you are, even if you don't know what else to say yet.\"This is a great way to protect your relationship while still naming the problem and offering something constructive.2. They take responsibility for their emotions and plan how to regulate them togetherEmotionally intelligent couples don't expect their partner to fix their feelings, but they also don't shut each other out. A partner's presence can help them stay regulated and connected, even in anger or frustration.Pausing during conflict is one of the hardest skills. It's hardest when you're triggered and least able to access your tools. I often encourage couples to plan ahead with a \"clean pause\" script, like: \"I need 20 minutes so I don't say something I'll regret. I'll come back.\" Follow-through matters as much as the pause. Couples can also use co-regulation — small ways to calm together: \"Can we sit next to each other while we talk?\" or, \"Can I get a hug first, then we keep going?\"These strategies help partners stay connected while still taking responsibility for their own emotions.3. They stay curious, even during major conflicts When people feel threatened, the brain loves shortcuts. Emotionally intelligent couples slow this process down and become, in effect, investigators of each other's inner worlds.Curiosity has been associated with greater closeness and intimacy in conversations, especially during moments of disagreement.Part of why curiosity disappears whether it's one, 10, or 20 years in is because we start living off our assumptions. We tell ourselves we already know what our partner meant, what they felt, and why they did it because the person across from you is so familiar.The problem is that once you think you already know the story, you stop learning about your partner's actual experience. Conflict then becomes two competing narratives instead of a shared inquiry into what's really happening, even when you disagree.Instead of assuming the worst, the most emotionally intelligent couples will ask questions like:\"Can you help me understand what was happening for you?\"\"What did you hear me say?\"\"What part of this feels hardest?\"\"What's been on your mind lately that I haven't asked about?\"\"What's something you want more of right now?\"The strongest, most emotionally intelligent couples genuinely see who their partner is becoming, not who they want them to be or who they once were.

    "body": "Waymo autonomous taxis turns onto Post Street in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo temporarily paused its robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area on Thursday, ahead of expected storms in the area, according to a customer notification in the company's driverless ride-hailing app.\"Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,\" the notification read.Earlier this week the Alphabet-owned company said it will update its fleet so its robotaxi service is better able to perform during power outages.On Dec. 20, Waymo paused service during a blackout in San Francisco that left tens of thousands of people in the area without power and caused some of its autonomous vehicles to halt in mid-traffic, contributing to or causing gridlock.The National Weather Service extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday 10 p.m. local time.Waymo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, or say whether regulators required its service pause on Thursday given the flash flood warnings.The California Public Utilities Commission — which regulates driverless ride-hailing services in the state — did not immediately respond to requests for information during the Christmas holiday on Thursday.Waymo currently operates a commercial, driverless service in five U.S. markets, up from three at the end of 2024. Waymo's robotaxi service has been operating in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles this year. The company intends to significantly expand its service area across and beyond the U.S. in 2026, CNBC previously reported.Waymo is facing increased public scrutiny and safety concerns as it attempts to expand its robotaxi service.The former CEO of San Francisco's Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin, told CNBC that regulators and robotaxi companies can take valuable lessons away from the chaos that arose with Waymo vehicles during the PG&E power outages last week.\"I think we need to be asking 'what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?'\" Tumlin said. He also suggested regulators may want to set up a staged system that will allow autonomous vehicle companies to rapidly scale their operations, provided they meet specific tests.One of those tests, he said, would be how quickly a company can get their autonomous vehicles safely out of the way of traffic if they encounter something that is confusing like a four-way intersection with no functioning traffic lights.Cities and regulators should also seek more data from robotaxi companies about the planned or actual performance of their vehicles during expected emergencies such as blackouts, floods or earthquakes, Tumlin said.",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 900 U.S. flights were canceled and close to 8,000 were delayed Saturday after a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S., putting carriers to the test during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Snowfall totals in the area were less than the earlier forecast, though New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey each recorded more than four inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.More than 136 flights, about a fifth of the scheduled departures from Kennedy Airport, were canceled, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. Another 87 were canceled from New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 20% of the day's scheduled departures, and 72, or 12%, of departures from Newark were scrubbed.Airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights on Friday, most of them ahead of the storm. Only 27 U.S. flights were listed as canceled for Sunday, according to FlightAware.American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets. They said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said. Flying as early as possible is likely the best bet with few seats available during the busy Christmas week.Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, expects carriers to fly a record 52.6 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 5, with this Friday and Sunday among the busiest days.Airlines generally cancel flights ahead of time for major weather events in the forecast, like blizzards or hurricanes, to avoid planes, connecting travelers and crews from getting stranded and worsening disruptions.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport lounges",

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

    "body": "This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of salesGuillaume Payen | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIt has been a monumental year for the video game industry, marked by new devices and billion-dollar deals.Further consolidation occurred within the sector when a consortium led by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, alongside Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake, announced plans to take Electronic Arts private. The $55 billion deal, which includes $20 billion in debt financing, is the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.The move could have major implications for EA, according to Omdia analysts. They said the question now is whether the PIF plans to run EA as a \"PR project\" or \"to extract maximum returns\" from the company. French game developer Ubisoft looked to turn its fortunes around this year, although it started 2025 with a second delay to the latest entry in its flagship Assassin's Creed series, Shadows.Ubisoft's shares received a boost in March after announcing the creation of a new gaming subsidiary with Chinese tech giant Tencent called Vantage Studios. The new developer, which will be part-owned by Tencent, will focus on Ubisoft's key IP — Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.watch nowDespite Ubisoft's efforts, shares have lost just over half of their value year to date, and the stock is down over 90% from its 2021 high.In contrast, Take-Two Interactive's shares continued to climb throughout 2025, as anticipation mounted for the next Grand Theft Auto title. It's been 12 years since the previous edition, GTA 5, was released on Xbox 360 and PS3.However, with radio silence on GTA 6 for most of the year, fans speculated that an additional delay from the May 26, 2026, release date was on the cards, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick telling CNBC in May that he had a \"very, very high conviction\" the scheduled date would be achievable. In November this year, the game was pushed back to Nov. 19, 2026, with shares in Take-Two tumbling on the news.The game will launch in the twilight window for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S — six years after both consoles were released. As focus shifts to the next generation of consoles, this past generation has seen a change in strategy for both brands. Console strategies shiftXbox has moved away from exclusive games, with titles such as Indiana Jones, Forza Horizon, and more releasing on PS5, while PlayStation continues to experiment further with releasing titles on PC. Take-Two's Zelnick argued that the shifting strategies will see the video game industry become more open. When asked whether the console will be in business within the next five to 10 years, he said the consoles will still be around, with the devices moving towards PC as \"business is moving towards open rather than closed.\"\"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours, that you play on a big screen, that's never going away,\" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in November.Consoles still have a huge role to play in the market, according to George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst for Games at Omdia. He told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the devices are still \"the go-to place for premium games.\"Data from Omdia shows that consoles are the second-largest category when it comes to total consumer spend, with mobile spend contributing 60%, consoles reaching 23%, and PCs hitting 16%. While others mostly abandoned exclusive titles, Nintendo has continued to pursue the strategy, releasing several exclusive titles for its new Switch 2 console – including an open-world reimaging of Mario Kart and a brand-new Donkey Kong game. This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of sales.Not all are convinced by Nintendo's strategy. Christopher Dring, founder and editor-in-chief of The Game Business, told CNBC's \"Built for Billions\" in November that Nintendo faces a challenge in maintaining demand for its systems.\"Unlike PlayStation and Xbox and other platforms, the people buying Nintendo machines are buying it for Nintendo games. What that means is, if they don't have a game ready, they can not rely on other developers to prop them up.\"",

    "body": "I spent seven years studying high-achieving students, interviewing hundreds of them and their families.Many young people I met described monitoring grades, rankings, and résumés as if they were constantly evaluating their worth. In some families, achievement took on an outsized role, leading some children to wonder whether their parents' love was tied to how well they performed.Achievement culture promises to open doors, suggesting that better grades and better college degrees guarantee better futures. But a growing body of research shows that this relentless chase can breed perfectionism, a trait linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression.So what can a parent do to protect against this narrow view of success and self-worth? We can help young people turn their self-focused attention outward. When children shift from \"How am I doing?\" to \"Where can I be useful?\" they develop a stronger identity, rooted in contribution rather than performance. Small, everyday ways of being needed — helping a neighbor, being counted on at home, showing up for a team — can buffer against that harmful inner-scorekeeping and build a sturdier sense of self-worth.When kids anchor their efforts in something beyond themselves, everyday stressors become more manageable. They stop believing they are only a grade or a score, and start feeling like a person who matters in the world. Here's how:1. Help kids notice genuine needs around them Recently, a woman told me she was on her way to the park with her two young kids when she saw their elderly neighbor raking her lawn. The neighbor waved off the woman's offer to help, but still, she unloaded her kids from the car, and they grabbed rakes, piling leaves into bags.The kids talked about it all afternoon — how happy their neighbor was, how much fun they had, and how good it felt to be useful. They were experiencing what psychologists call a \"helper's high\" and a growing sense of agency.To help children look beyond themselves, try prompts like \"What do you think she might need today?\" or \"Who could use a hand right now?\" Regular acts, such as checking on a neighbor, delivering a meal, and volunteering, strengthen kids' sense of belonging within their community.2. Build contribution into daily routinesOne mother I interviewed taped a sheet of paper to the front door with a short list of family tasks. When her kids came home from school, she'd ask them to sign the ones they could take on that day. Over time, these small commitments helped her children see themselves not just as children who sometimes help, but as contributors to their family.That shift toward a helper identity matters. In a study of 149 children ages 3 to 6, researchers found that thanking children for \"being a helper\" rather than \"helping\" significantly increased their willingness to pitch in. They were motivated by the idea of becoming someone who helps. Across studies, people who feel useful and connected show lower stress and greater resilience, suggesting that contribution is protective.3. Make the invisible work of care visibleKids learn generosity by watching us. But modeling alone isn't enough. We have to make our thinking visible. When you check on a neighbor, bring soup to a sick friend, or help someone who looks overwhelmed, narrate the \"why\" behind your actions. You might say, \"I brought her soup so she knows she's not alone.\" Or, you might explain, \"He looked like he needed a hand with those bags,\" or, \"I texted her because I had a feeling today might be hard.\" These small explanations give kids a mental model of why we help and an internal script they can use themselves.In a culture that too often reduces young people to what they achieve, helping them look outward is one of the most potent antidotes we have to excessive pressure. When young people discover ways to contribute that aren't tied to external metrics, they gain a more grounded sense of who they are and the larger role they can play in the world.Jennifer Breheny Wallace is an award-winning journalist and author of the New York Times bestseller \"Never Enough: When Achievement Culture Becomes Toxic — and What We Can Do About It.\" She lives in New York City with her husband and three teens. You can follow her on Instagram @jenniferbrehenywallace. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "As a relationship counselor with over 10 years of experience, I've learned that even the strongest couples face conflict. What sets emotionally intelligent couples apart is their ability to stay connected, even when disagreements arise.I'm often more concerned about couples who never fight, because avoiding conflict entirely can hide unresolved hurts. After all, the closer you are, the more likely ruptures are to happen, and how you handle them matters.Here are three things emotionally intelligent couples do differently when they are in conflict.1. They don't assume the worst about their partner's intentWe've all been there. One sharp comment can seem like an attack on your character. For example, you forget to text back and it is interpreted as not caring. A request for space could be misconstrued as abandonment.Research shows that when couples are distressed, they're more likely to interpret a partner's behavior in ways that make it feel intentional, fixed, and personal (\"you did this because you're that kind of person\"). Psychologists call this \"negative attribution bias.\"Before conflicts devolve into defensiveness and character attacks, I give my clients a simple exercise.Write down what you want to say. For example, \"Why do you shut down every time I bring something up?\" Then cross out every sentence that diagnoses your partner's motives (\"you don't care,\" \"you're trying to…,\" \"you always…\").Next, try a reframe. Write down the observable behavior, its impact on you, and one clear, workable request: \"When you go silent in moments like this, I start filling in the gaps on my own. I tell myself you don't care or that I've done something wrong, and I feel alone pretty quickly. What would really help is just hearing where you are, even if you don't know what else to say yet.\"This is a great way to protect your relationship while still naming the problem and offering something constructive.2. They take responsibility for their emotions and plan how to regulate them togetherEmotionally intelligent couples don't expect their partner to fix their feelings, but they also don't shut each other out. A partner's presence can help them stay regulated and connected, even in anger or frustration.Pausing during conflict is one of the hardest skills. It's hardest when you're triggered and least able to access your tools. I often encourage couples to plan ahead with a \"clean pause\" script, like: \"I need 20 minutes so I don't say something I'll regret. I'll come back.\" Follow-through matters as much as the pause. Couples can also use co-regulation — small ways to calm together: \"Can we sit next to each other while we talk?\" or, \"Can I get a hug first, then we keep going?\"These strategies help partners stay connected while still taking responsibility for their own emotions.3. They stay curious, even during major conflicts When people feel threatened, the brain loves shortcuts. Emotionally intelligent couples slow this process down and become, in effect, investigators of each other's inner worlds.Curiosity has been associated with greater closeness and intimacy in conversations, especially during moments of disagreement.Part of why curiosity disappears whether it's one, 10, or 20 years in is because we start living off our assumptions. We tell ourselves we already know what our partner meant, what they felt, and why they did it because the person across from you is so familiar.The problem is that once you think you already know the story, you stop learning about your partner's actual experience. Conflict then becomes two competing narratives instead of a shared inquiry into what's really happening, even when you disagree.Instead of assuming the worst, the most emotionally intelligent couples will ask questions like:\"Can you help me understand what was happening for you?\"\"What did you hear me say?\"\"What part of this feels hardest?\"\"What's been on your mind lately that I haven't asked about?\"\"What's something you want more of right now?\"The strongest, most emotionally intelligent couples genuinely see who their partner is becoming, not who they want them to be or who they once were.

    "body": "Engagement season is upon us, with December being the most popular month to propose worldwide, according to The Knot.And while traditionally men have been expected to shell out for that diamond — as Beyoncé put it in 2008, he should've \"put a ring on it\" — many women are changing their expectations around who makes the purchase. Nearly 71% (70.6%) of women say they're willing to contribute to the cost of their engagement ring, according to DatingAdvice.com's recent Holiday Engagement Survey of 1,000 partnered U.S. adults.Almost 19% said they would pay for the ring in full, about 23% said they'd partially pay and 29% said they would contribute if needed. Here's why Natassia Miller, a certified sexologist who founded the sex and relationship coaching company Wonderlust, thinks women might be changing their tune. There are more dual-income couples these daysThere are more couples earning two salaries, with or without kids, than there were a decade ago, according to the Pew Research Center.And while, on average, the gender wage gap persists, there are some metro areas in the U.S. where women under the age of 30 earn as much as or more than their male counterparts, according to Pew. \"Today, with more dual‑income couples and women delaying marriage while they build careers,\" says Miller, \"there's more openness to treating the ring as a shared investment.\"Some 'couples are more pragmatic'This piece of jewelry is expensive: The average cost of an engagement ring is $5,200, according to The Knot.And headlines abound about Americans' financial hardships. Overall prices are up 25% since January 2020, for example, according to Consumer Price Index data, and nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, according to a recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma.\"Against that backdrop, it makes sense that couples are more pragmatic,\" says Miller. \"Instead of one partner taking on debt to hit an arbitrary ring budget, some women would rather share the cost and keep the purchase aligned with reality.​\"It's a 'public symbol' that says 'someone committed to me'Finally, even as they consider their financial realities, women are willing to pay because the ring is symbolic.\"Even women who are financially independent often grew up on a steady diet of rom‑coms, social media proposals, and bridal marketing where the ring is framed as proof of worthiness and desirability,\" says Miller.For many women, \"an engagement ring is still a public symbol that says, 'Someone committed to me, and is willing to show that to the world.'\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "description": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headline",
    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a press conference after their lunch meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, in Palm Beach, Florida, on Dec. 28, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Sunday said that talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war had progressed after his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida, though Trump acknowledged that thorny issues over territory remain.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.In his remarks, Zelenskyy called the peace talks a \"really great discussion\" in which U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, though Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.\"We agree that security guarantees is a key milestone in achieving lasting peace,\" Zelenskyy said.Further, the Ukrainian president said that Trump will host meetings next month with Ukrainian and European leaders to continue developing the peace plan.When asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Earlier Sunday in a Truth Social post, Trump said he had a \"good and very productive telephone call\" with Putin ahead of the Zelenskyy talks. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he planned on calling Putin again after the conclusion of the meeting.The high-stakes conversations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort come at a key moment in efforts to end nearly four years of war initiated when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.Zelenskyy, who arrived in Florida early Sunday, has said the two leaders plan to talk about economic and security agreements and the \"territorial issues\" that remain major sticking points between Russia and Ukraine.While Zelenskyy told reporters this week that a 20-point peace proposal is roughly 90% ready, it's unclear if the outcome of the peace talks would be acceptable to Putin. Chief obstacles to an agreement with Russia include the Donbas areas most highly coveted by Putin, U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, and the status of Europe's largest nuclear plant.Moscow has reportedly made advances on the battlefield in recent months, claiming control over more regions of eastern Ukraine, and their officials have repeatedly insisted that Ukraine give up all of the Donbas, even parts that are still under Kyiv's control.On Saturday, Russia hit Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country with hundreds of missiles and drones, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital, according to Reuters. Zelenskyy called it Russia's response to the U.S.-brokered peace efforts.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacts as U.S. President Donald Trump, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, speaks during a meeting with a Ukrainian delegation led by Zelenskiy, at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on Dec. 28, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe peace proposal includes calls for a Ukrainian vote on ceding disputed territory to Russia, as well as a demilitarized \"free economic zone\" in Donetsk, the capital and largest city in part of the larger Donbas region. Zelenskyy on Sunday pointed to the attacks on his country's energy infrastructure amid the peace efforts and indicated that part of his motivation was to maintain pressure on Russia, including sanctions and defense technology for Ukraine.\"These are some of the most active diplomatic days of the year right now, and a lot can be decided before the New Year,\" Zelenskyy said on social media platform X. \"We are doing everything toward this, but whether decisions will be made depends on our partners — those who help Ukraine, and those who put pressure on Russia so that Russians feel the consequences of their own aggression.\"Earlier Sunday, a Kremlin official said that the U.S. and Russian leaders were aligned in opposing a temporary ceasefire amid talks and hinted that Ukraine needed to make a \"bold decision\" regarding the Donbas region for the war to end. \"The main thing is that the presidents of Russia and the United States hold similar views that the option of a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and the Europeans under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or under other pretexts only leads to a prolongation of the conflict,\" Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told Reuters.In his Truth Social post, Trump said his meeting with Zelenskyy would be held in the main dining room at his Mar-a-Lago resort, with media present.In February, a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy over possible mineral deals between the countries devolved into a public spectacle, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance accusing Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" to the U.S. president.

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

Coupang said users can check their eligibility for the vouchers starting Jan. 15, according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean.Harold Rogers, interim CEO for Coupang Corp., described the move as a \"responsible measure for our customers,\" and said the company would \"fulfill its responsibilities to the end.\" \"I once again deeply apologize to our customers,\" he said in the statement. Rogers' apology came a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom also apologized, saying that he was \"devastated\" by the disappointment people have experienced. The data breach, which was revealed on Nov. 18, led to the resignation of CEO Park Dae-jun earlier this month.Coupang founder Kim Bom said in a separate statement that the company had failed to communicate clearly from the outset of the incident.The U.S.-based chairman acknowledged his apology was \"overdue,\" explaining that he initially believed it was best to communicate publicly and apologize only after all the facts were confirmed.\"In retrospect, this was a poor judgment. While Coupang worked tirelessly to resolve the situation, I should have expressed my deepest regrets and sincere apologies from the beginning. My heart has been heavy ever since I first learned of the data breach,\" Kim said.Kim added that the company has recovered all the leaked customer information through cooperation with the government, as well as the storage devices belonging to a suspect behind the data breach.He also said the customer information stored on the suspect's computer was limited to 3,000 records and that it was not distributed or sold externally. watch now",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump, flanked by Navy Secretary John Phelan (R), announces the US Navy's new Golden Fleet initiative, unveiling a new class of frigates, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHeading into 2026, investor focus could shift from fixed-income instruments to attractive dividend stocks, given a lower interest rate backdrop. Picking the right names from a vast universe of dividend-paying companies is a challenging task. Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choices, as these experts assign their ratings after conducting a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.ChevronOil and gas giant Chevron (CVX) is this week's first dividend pick. The company returned $6 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter via $3.4 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. With a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share (annualized dividend of $6.84 per share), Chevron offers a yield of about 4.5%.Following meetings with Chevron's management, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on CVX stock with a price target of $178. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on the energy company, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $164.Todd noted that while the ongoing scenario of an unfavorable crude backdrop and positive refining business has affected Chevron's performance, his meetings with the management reflected the company's solid position.The analyst contends that Chevron's capital efficiency is underappreciated. Notably, the company's upstream capital expenditure/boe (barrel of oil equivalent) produced is 29% below the peer average. He added that given the declining capex and operating expenses, the benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) that have yet to materialize, and a resource base that is better than feared, Chevron's free cash flow (FCF) annual growth outlook of 10% per year seems conservative.Additionally, Todd argued that \"while investors may continue to worry about TCO [Tengizchevroil joint venture] contract extensions, lingering post-2030 resource depth questions are misguided.\" In this matter, the analyst noted that aside from the projects included in Chevron's official plan, management is upbeat about additional opportunities presented by improved global access (especially in the Middle East), a rise in exploration activities, and expansion and technology-driven prospects.Todd ranks No. 868 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.5%. See Chevron Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Darden RestaurantsRestaurant company Darden Restaurants (DRI) owns a portfolio of brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on Feb. 2, 2026. At an annualized dividend of $6 per share, DRI offers a yield of 3.2%.Following the company's mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on Darden stock with a price target of $225. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $218 with an \"outperform\" rating.Saleh noted that Darden posted a mixed, but \"mostly positive,\" quarter, with better-than-anticipated comparable sales fueled by improved traffic at the company's major brands.\"Its strategy of under-pricing inflation, leaning on delivery, and offering a desirable menu resonated with guests, driving another quarter of sizable industry outperformance,\" said Saleh.The five-star analyst highlighted that high beef prices continued to be a headwind and weighed on the quarter's restaurant margins and earnings per share (EPS). That said, Saleh is optimistic about Darden achieving its guidance, as beef costs appear to have peaked, labor cost pressures are easing, and management is relying slightly on price increases to offset commodity costs.Overall, Saleh continues to be impressed by the momentum in Darden's sales, and although earnings haven't kept pace yet, they are expected to improve going forward.Saleh ranks No. 641 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.5%. See Darden Restaurants Statistics on TipRanks. Ares CapitalThis week's third dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. The company announced a dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on Dec. 30, 2025. At an annualized dividend per share of $1.92, ARCC stock offers a yield of 9.5%.In his latest research note on business development companies (BDCs), RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee called Ares Capital one of his favorite BDC names for 2026 and reaffirmed a buy rating with a price target of $23. TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned an \"outperform\" rating to ARCC stock with a price target of $24.While Lee is less constructive on the BDC space heading into 2026 due to a potential decline in net interest income (NII) and return on equity (ROE) from lower base rates, he remains bullish on Ares Capital. In particular, he cited management's confidence in sustaining dividends at current levels despite expectations of lower base rates.Among the key strengths, Lee noted ARCC's dominant position in the BDC market, its extensive scale, and strong originations in the Ares direct lending platform. He also highlighted Ares Capital's more than 20 years of experience.\"In our view, ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share generation plus potential net realized gains,\" said Lee to support his bullish stance.Lee ranks No. 341 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.5%. See Ares Capital Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. ",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 1,400 U.S. flights were canceled and 11,000 were delayed over the weekend after a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S., putting carriers to the test during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Snowfall totals in the area were less than the earlier forecast, though New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey each recorded more than four inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.More than 130 flights, about a fifth of the scheduled departures from Kennedy Airport, were canceled, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. Another 87 were canceled from New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 20% of the day's scheduled departures, and 72, or 12%, of departures from Newark were scrubbed.Airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights on Friday, most of them ahead of the storm. Nearly 400 U.S. flights were canceled for Sunday, according to FlightAware. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers last week waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets. They said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said. Flying as early as possible is likely the best bet with few seats available during the busy Christmas week.Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, expects carriers to fly a record 52.6 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 5, with this Friday and Sunday among the busiest days.Airlines generally cancel flights ahead of time for major weather events in the forecast, like blizzards or hurricanes, to avoid planes, connecting travelers and crews from getting stranded and worsening disruptions.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport lounges",

    "body": "This photo taken on February 2, 2024 shows Lu Yu, head of Product Management and Operations of Wantalk, an artificial intelligence chatbot created by Chinese tech company Baidu, showing a virtual girlfriend profile on her phone, at the Baidu headquarters in Beijing.Jade Gao | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — China plans to restrict artificial intelligence-powered chatbots from influencing human emotions in ways that could lead to suicide or self-harm, according to draft rules released Saturday.The proposed regulations from the Cyberspace Administration target what it calls \"human-like interactive AI services,\" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese-language document.The measures, once finalized, will apply to AI products or services offered to the public in China that simulate human personality and engage users emotionally through text, images, audio or video. The public comment period ends Jan. 25.Beijing's planned rules would mark the world's first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. The latest proposals come as Chinese companies have rapidly developed AI companions and digital celebrities.Compared with China's generative AI regulation in 2023, Ma said that this version \"highlights a leap from content safety to emotional safety.\"The draft rules propose that: AI chatbots cannot generate content that encourages suicide or self-harm, or engage in verbal violence or emotional manipulation that damages users' mental health.If a user specifically proposes suicide, the tech providers must have a human take over the conversation and immediately contact the user's guardian or a designated individual.The AI chatbots must not generate gambling-related, obscene or violent content.Minors must have guardian consent to use AI for emotional companionship, with time limits on usage.Platforms should be able to determine whether a user is a minor even if the user does not disclose their age, and, in cases of doubt, apply settings for minors, while allowing for appeals.watch nowAdditional provisions would require tech providers to remind users after two hours of continuous AI interaction and mandate security assessments for AI chatbots with more than 1 million registered users or over 100,000 monthly active users.The document also encouraged the use of human-like AI in \"cultural dissemination and elderly companionship.\"Chinese AI chatbot IPOsThe proposal comes shortly after two leading Chinese AI chatbot startups, Z.ai and Minimax, filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong this month.Minimax is best known internationally for its Talkie AI app, which allows users to chat with virtual characters. The app and its domestic Chinese version, Xingye, accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue in the first three quarters of the year, with an average of over 20 million monthly active users during that time.Z.ai, also known as Zhipu, filed under the name \"Knowledge Atlas Technology.\" While the company did not disclose monthly active users, it noted its technology \"empowered\" around 80 million devices, including smartphones, personal computers and smart vehicles.Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comments on how the proposed rules could affect their IPO plans.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

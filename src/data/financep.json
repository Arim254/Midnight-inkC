    "body": "Shares of automaker Stellantis dropped more than 14% in European trading on Friday, after the company said it expects to take a 22-billion-euro ($26 billion) hit from overhauling its business to accelerate the rollout of electric and hybrid vehicles.Shortly after the European opening bell, Milan-listed shares of the firm were 14.4% lower. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis share priceThe Jeep maker also pre-released some figures for the fourth quarter, saying it anticipates a net loss for 2025. In recognition of that net loss, it has suspended its dividend for 2026 and plans to raise up to 5 billion euros by issuing hybrid bonds.For 2026, the auto giant is targeting a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit increase in its adjusted operating income margin.\"The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers' real-world needs, means and desires,\" said Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa in a statement.\"They also reflect the impact of previous poor operational execution, the effects of which are being progressively addressed by our new Team.\"The company said its dividend pause and bond issuance would help preserve its balance sheet, and outlined the actions it had taken last year as part of its reset strategy. These included announcing \"the largest investment in Stellantis' U.S. history\" — totalling $13 billion over four years — as well as launching 10 new products, canceling products that could not achieve profit at scale, and restructuring its global manufacturing and quality management capabilities. While these moves had resulted in costs of 22.2 billion euros, the company said they had collectively delivered a return to positive volume growth in 2025. In the second half of the year, Stellantis' U.S. market share rose to 7.9%, while the company said it retained its overall second-place market share position in the enlarged Europe. Stellantis is scheduled to publish its 2025 earnings in full on Feb. 26. ",

Tesla continues to expand its footprint in China, with the Shanghai Gigafactory contributing significantly to the company’s global production capacity. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTesla remained a strong contender in Beijing's competitive electric vehicle scene, as the company's China-produced EV sales grew modestly in January from the year before, amid a broader industry slowdown.According to data published by the China Passenger Car Association on Wednesday, January deliveries from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory rose by 9% to 69,129 units, from 63,238 in January 2025.The latest January deliveries places Tesla in third place against other Chinese EV manufacturers. BYD was in the lead at 205,518 shipments, while Geely came in second with 124,252 units, according to the CPCA.Despite the rise in deliveries, there is little indication of an actual growth in demand for Tesla's offerings in China — the world's largest EV market.The company's January delivery figures reflect the total number of shipments from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which produces the Model 3 and Model Y for domestic and foreign markets in Europe, the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.New registrations in January for Tesla passenger vehicles — a proxy for sales — rose slightly in Europe, according to Reuters.Domestic price warTesla has faced stiff competition from a number of Chinese EV brands with more affordable offerings. In a separate report, the CPCA noted that the total sales of Tesla's China-produced EVs fell by 4.8% in 2025 — one of only two manufacturers in Beijing that reported declining annual sales from the year before.At around 235,500 yuan ($33,943), Tesla's base Model 3 sedan costs nearly three times the price of the base model for BYD's Seal, at around 79,800 yuan.Like other automakers, Tesla has sought to maintain its competitiveness in China through aggressive price cuts. According to its Chinese website, Tesla has begun offering five-year 0% interest loans, or seven-year \"ultra-low\" interest rate loans for orders placed before Feb. 28.\"We have [had] really intense price wars that have gone on, although the government and industry have called on automakers to not engage with aggressive pricing strategies,\" Abby Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility, tells CNBC.Despite these involutive price wars, China's EV market has slowed considerably.According to CPCA data, new energy vehicle sales, which include hybrid and battery-powered cars, grew by only 1% year on year in January - a fourth-straight month of slowing growth.The slowdown is projected to continue, as Beijing has slashed support for new EV sales. From Jan. 1, a 5% tax on new energy vehicle purchases was reinstated, after previously being exempted from the full 10% tax for more than a decade. New energy vehicles include battery and hybrid-powered cars.New regulationsTesla's challenges are further compounded by a recent announcement from Beijing which will effectively ban concealed door handles. On Monday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that from Jan. 1, 2027, all door handles on cars sold in the country must have interior and exterior mechanical releases.The announcement follows a spate of high-profile incidents in the U.S. and China, where EV occupants involved in road accidents could not be freed after their vehicles caught fire, as a result of power failures in the door-locking mechanisms.While automakers in China have a decent runway to ensure compliance with the new regulations, it remains to be seen how Tesla will adapt, given that flush door handles were first popularized as a signature design feature on Tesla's minimalist vehicles.Some analysts, like Tu Le, founder and managing director of consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, see China's new car door handle restrictions as likely to pose a \"decent sized headache\" for Tesla.However, Le said, China's new regulations will likely have little impact on most automakers.\"I think for lots of Chinese brands, this new regulation [will not] take them by surprise, because when regulators were drafting the new regulations, they consulted OEMs and industry experts intensively,\" Le added.CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.Correction: This copy has been updated to correctly reflect the name spelling of Abby Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility.",

    "body": "Sanae Takaichi, Japan's prime minister and president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), speaks at an LDP election rally in Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. Traders are bracing for increased volatility as the Feb. 8 lower house election approaches. Photographer: Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is poised to lead her ruling coalition to a landslide victory in this weekend's snap election, a Nikkei poll has shown. The poll, conducted from Tuesday to Thursday, showed that the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, were likely to secure more than 300 of the 465 seats in the Lower House. The findings echo an earlier poll by the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun, which also projected that the ruling bloc would gain more than 300 seats. The Central Reform Alliance — an alliance of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito — is forecast to have its seat count roughly halved from the current 167 seats, according to the Nikkei poll.Separate polling by Kyodo News suggests the LDP could secure a single-party majority of more than 233 seats on its own.According to Nikkei, the LDP now has its sights on surpassing 261 seats, a threshold that would allow it to control all parliamentary committees and chair positions.A two-thirds majority in the Lower House would also give the ruling party the power to override an Upper House veto when it comes to passing legislation.The election follows political upheaval last year, when the LDP lost its majority in the Upper House, and a Lower House defeat in 2024, which prompted then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to resign in September.The poll also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump publicly expressed support for the ruling coalition, announcing in a Truth Social post that he planned to meet Takaichi on March 19.Trump added, \"it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing. SHE WILL NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN DOWN!\" Takaichi had staked her political future on this election, vowing to resign if the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority.With her high personal approval ratings, the fiercely conservative prime minister is looking to convert that popularity into votes for the LDP and her coalition. Kristi Govella, Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told CNBC that a clear victory would reflect Takaichi's personal popularity, instead of any improvements in economic conditions in Japan.\"Little else has changed since July when the LDP was drubbed at the polls,\" Govella added.",

Analysts expected 138 million DAUs.Roblox announced in its letter to shareholders that it no longer plans to issue annual guidance starting in 2027 due to \"inherent variability\" in the company's business. Instead, Roblox said it will focus on providing quarterly guidance. Roblox has faced criticism for putting underage users at risk, with multiple lawsuits on behalf of children who were sexually exploited on the gaming platform.The company said that late in the fourth quarter it began a mandatory age check for users looking to access communication features in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Roblox said 60% of its daily users in those markets had age checked while 45% of global daily users had done so.Roblox said the age-check rollout, which was completed globally in January, has caused \"a mid-single-digit headwind to engagement growth and a low-single-digit headwind to bookings growth.\" But the company added that \"the strategic upside is significant.\"\"Accurate age data unlocks a long-term opportunity to tailor features and content, increasing safety and civility, which in turn drives organic engagement growth,\" the company wrote.Roblox said it has found that the age checking has revealed its user base is younger than indicated by self-reported data. Among daily users, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, 35% are under the age of 13 and 27% are over 18. The company said it views its scale with young users as a \"valuable strategic asset.\"WATCH: Gaming stocks plunge on news of Google AI gaming toolwatch now",

    "body": "A Toyota dealership is seen on November 19, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesToyota Motor announced Friday that Chief Executive Officer Koji Sato will step down and be replaced by its Chief Financial Officer, Kenta Kon, marking the automaker's second CEO transition in three years.The leadership shakeup will take effect on April 1, with Sato assuming the position of vice chairman and a newly created role as chief industry officer. \"Under this new leadership structure, Sato will focus on the broader industry, including Toyota, as Vice Chairman and CIO, while Kon will focus on internal company management as President and CEO,\" the company said in a statement. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kon likened the switch to Sato becoming \"captain of the national team,\" and Kon the \"club captain.\" Sato explained the change was made so he could focus on leveraging his new roles as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and as vice chair of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business lobby. Sato had been appointed CEO in 2023, succeeding longtime leader Akio Toyoda. Executive Vice President Yoichi Miyazaki will take over Kon's old position as CFO. Meanwhile, Toyota plans to make further board changes in June 2026, with Kon joining as a director and Sato resigning from his board seat. Toyota added that the leadership changes will help speed up decision-making amid industry challenges and accelerate its transformation into a more diversified mobility company.Sales revenue for the December quarter reached 13.46 trillion Japanese yen, up 8.6% from the same period the year prior. That beat LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate, by 10%.However, operating income fell to 1.19 trillion, down 2% amid continued impacts from U.S. tariffs. Shares were trading up 1.5% on Friday following the news.Toyota has been increasing its focus on electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, amid tough global competition. That was reflected in its earnings, also announced on Friday, which showed that electrified vehicles have accounted for nearly half of its retail vehicle sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Sales were driven by strong demand for hybrid vehicles in regions such as North America and China.Toyota raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 11.8%, citing a weak yen and cost reductions to help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesReddit shares rose 5% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines and gave strong guidance for the start of 2026.Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: $1.24 vs. 94 cents expectedRevenue: $726 million vs. $665 million expectedThe company said it expects first-quarter sales to come in the range of $595 million to $605 million, which is higher than Wall Street expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected to come in between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $203 million.Reddit also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year over year, while net income was $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period a year ago.Reddit's sales in the U.S. market came in at $583 million in the fourth quarter, topping analyst estimates of $529 million.The company's global daily active uniques, or DAUq, grew 19% year over year to 121.4 million in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 120 million that Wall Street was expecting.Fourth-quarter U.S. DAUq grew 9% year over year to 52.5 million, slightly ahead of the 52.3 million that analysts were projecting.The company said that logged-in DAUq for the U.S., which refers to users who have registered for Reddit accounts, rose 5% year over year to 23 million. That was slower than the 7% year over year growth Reddit said it recorded during the third quarter when its logged-in DAUq for the U.S. came in at 23.1 million. This is the sixth straight quarter in which Reddit's U.S. logged-in user growth has slowed.Investors have been monitoring Reddit's logged-in DAUq metric because users who have created accounts are more lucrative to the company's online advertising business. These Reddit account holders generally use the platform and engage with other users more frequently than those who may have stumbled into Reddit via Google search, which the company refers to as logged-out DAUq.In an investor letter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company plans to \"phase out reporting on logged-in and logged-out later this year\" because there's now less of a distinction between the two metrics than in the past. That's because the company has been working on features intended to keep both logged-in users and logged-out users glued to the platform, Huffman said.\"As the industry evolves, how we think about our product and users must evolve too,\" Huffman wrote. \"We've historically reported logged-in vs. logged-out users, but as some of our work to streamline onboarding — instant personalization, for example — blurs the line between these states, the distinction between them makes less sense.\"Reddit finance chief Drew Vollero told analysts during an earnings call that the company will continue to report both metrics for the first two quarters of 2026.Regarding the company's data-licensing deals with Google and OpenAI, Huffman said during the earnings call that \"relationships with both companies are very healthy\" and that \"the conversation is shifting from a purely business deal to more of a product partnership.\"\"Specifically, what we're looking for in any relationship like this is can we bring users into the community parts of Reddit,\"  Huffman said. Regarding Reddit's efforts to unify its traditional search tool with its more recent generative AI search feature, Huffman said that the company has learned that \"the GenAI search results will just be better for most queries.\"Unlike traditional search, cutting-edge GenAI search and chat tools excel at providing results that contain \"multiple perspectives from lots of people,\" he said.WATCH: Snap CEO Evan Spiegel discusses social media and well-being.watch now",

    "body": "Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles Shri Piyush Goyal is talking to media on EU-India trade relations. India will waive tariffs on industrial imports from four European nations for a $100 billion investment over 15 years, ending nearly 16 years of negotiations.Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNew Delhi is ready to place orders worth up to $80 billion for Boeing planes, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal reportedly said, signaling New Delhi's willingness to expand trade with the U.S.India's demand for aircraft alone, with orders for Boeing \"yet to be placed but ready,\" is nearly $80 billion, Goyal said on Thursday, adding that if engines and other spare parts are added, imports from U.S. will \"cross 100 billion dollars just [from] aircrafts.\"Families of passengers who died in the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad in June last year are suing Boeing, over the alleged role of defective dual switches in the disaster that saw 241 of the 242  the minister said on board lose their lives.The minister also said that there was potential to procure a minimum of $500 billion worth of goods from the U.S. over the next five years, but clarified that there was no explicit investment commitment made as part of the trade deal with Washington.On Monday, within a week of the India-EU trade deal, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in a social media post that Washington and New Delhi had agreed a trade deal. Trump said that the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18%, while New Delhi will lower duties on U.S. goods to zero, replace Russian oil with supply from U.S. and Venezuela, open sensitive markets such as agriculture and buy $500 billion worth of American goods.The Indian Prime minister expressed delight over cut in duties, as goods from the country entering U.S. have been subjected to 50% in tariffs, but did not acknowledge any other details shared by Trump.watch nowWhile experts agree that India will buy more from the U.S., they have said the target of buying goods worth $500 billion from Washington  \"seems a stretch.\"India's overall goods imports stood at $720.24 billion in financial year 2025, with its trade deficit at $94.3 billion. That includes goods worth $45.3 billion from the U.S.Deal timelineIndia and the U.S. will sign a joint statement in the next 3-4 days, finalizing the first tranche of the trade deal between the two countries, Goyal said on Thursday. The 18% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. will become effective after the joint statement is issued, he added.Two sides will then sign a formal agreement in mid-March, after which the tariff concession for U.S. goods entering India will become effective.Since the deal has been announced, the Indian government has been scant with details and is facing questions from opposition political parties. The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being \"compromised\" and of having \"surrendered on Tariffs.The Indian government has not confirmed some of Trump's claims about the trade deal such as India reducing duties on U.S. goods to zero and halting imports of Russian oil, as well as a firm commitment to purchasing goods worth $500 billion.Experts say Trump's claims seem \"unrealistic\" and risk the U.S. backtracking on the trade deal, citing his threats to raise tariffs on South Korea, after slashing them in July last year, despite a trade deal.",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to \"leave Iran now\" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  The U.S. has issued several similar security alerts over the past month. The Embassy last urged American citizens to leave the country in a warning on Jan. 14 as Trump was weighing options for a possible intervention in Iran, including targeted military strikes.The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran’s three main nuclear facilities.  Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.Little hope?The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a \"massive armada,\" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain \"far apart and there is zero trust,\" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. watch nowAs Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets. Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to the report. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Nov. 6, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced the launch of TrumpRx — a direct-to-consumer website that is key to his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. The president said millions of Americans would save money through the platform. But it's still unclear if all patients — particularly those with insurance coverage — will see more cost savings from using that site to buy their medicines than they would through existing methods. TrumpRx targets people who are willing to pay with cash and forgo insurance, which suggests that patients without or with limited coverage may benefit the most. \"You're going to save a fortune and this is also so good for overall health care,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night unveiling the website.The site does not sell drugs directly to American patients, but acts as a central hub that points them to drugmakers that are offering discounts on certain products on their own direct-to-consumer sites, or gives them discount coupons to take to pharmacies. For example, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were already offering their blockbuster obesity drugs at hefty discounts to cash-paying patients, even before the reductions Trump touted on Thursday.Clicking on the platform's offer for Lilly's popular Zepbound weight loss injection sends consumers to the company's LillyDirect platform, where they can order the treatment and submit prescription details.A screenshot of a Zepbound order on the TrumpRx website.\nPreview\nFilters\nSource InfoIn recent months, Lilly, Novo and at least 14 other drugmakers have negotiated agreements with the Trump administration to participate on the platform and voluntarily sell certain medicines at a discount to Medicaid patients. Those landmark deals are part of Trump's broader \"most favored nation\" policy, which pushes to link U.S. drug prices to the lowest ones abroad.At launch, the site features only medications from the first five companies to strike pricing deals with the administration: AstraZeneca, Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, according to a White House fact sheet. It will list drugs from other companies \"in the coming months,\" the administration said.The platform is the government's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations — and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.But TrumpRx \"doesn't seem like it is the only solution\" to that issue for most Americans, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization. The cash-pay offerings could be better deals for patients without insurance, but it's difficult to assess exactly how many people stand to benefit from TrumpRx, she added. \"If they're able to get a drug covered by their insurance at a relatively affordable copay, then there's not a great upside to using the TrumpRx website,\" Cubanski said. She said people with insurance coverage who buy through direct-to-consumer platforms may also not have their purchases count toward their benefits, which means it doesn't help them meet their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. But Cubanski said there's potential for TrumpRx to be helpful in expanding access to certain drugs at more affordable prices, particularly medicines not covered widely by insurance in the U.S., such as obesity drugs. Medicare will start covering weight loss treatments for the first time later this year as part of the deals Lilly and Novo struck with Trump, but many employers are still hesitant to cover those drugs. Still, many of the other products expected to be listed on TrumpRx are already widely covered through insurance, and some are available as cheaper generics from competing drugmakers. Questions about savingsQuestions remain about how much savings people can expect if they buy their medicines at direct-to-consumer prices. The announced price reductions for certain drugs are framed as steep cuts from their so-called retail list prices. For example, under Novo Nordisk's agreement with the administration, some doses of its diabetes drug Ozempic will be priced at $350 per month on TrumpRx, which is less than half of its roughly $1,000 monthly list price. But those list prices are often far higher than what private insurers and government programs ultimately pay for medicines after rebates, discounts and other concessions, according to researchers at Georgetown's Medicare Policy Initiative. That suggests some payers may already be securing prices comparable to — or lower than — the newly announced discounts on medications under the Trump deals. The Georgetown researchers cited one study that found that average discounts on brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D run around 40% of list prices. Meanwhile, discounts in Medicaid exceed 75%, according to a Congressional Budget Office study. In the private sector, \"we've got insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiating lower prices and designing an insurance benefit that enables people to benefit from those price negotiations,\" said KFF's Cubanski. \"My guess is that for most drugs, at least most brand-name medications, people are likely to get a better deal using their insurance rather than purchasing a drug through a direct-to-consumer website,\" she said. Drugs on TrumpRxAt the launch of the site, the administration listed a range of major drugs as available for discounts, with a particular emphasis on popular GLP-1 products:Ozempic injection for diabetes, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,000Wegovy injection for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,350Wegovy pill for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: $149 per month for the starting dosesZepbound injection for obesity, made by Eli Lilly: starting at $299 per month, down from $1,086The White House also put an emphasis on cash-pay discounts for fertility drugs like Gonal-F from EMD Serono, which was listed at $168. Dozens of other drugs that companies expected to be be listed on the platform were not as of Thursday night. Those include key treatments from companies including Amgen, Merck and Gilead, among others.In an interview with CNBC at a conference in January, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has multiple products on its existing direct-to-consumer platform, which first offered a cash-pay discount on its blood thinner Eliquis. That platform will eventually link to TrumpRx, he said. The company is going to examine ways to put additional products in its portfolio on its own platform, \"where it makes sense,\" Boerner added. He said Bristol Myers is \"aligned with the administration\" on the issue of the U.S. health care system being too complex, and said several middlemen can increase costs. \"What we like about these [direct-to-consumer models], where they make sense from a business standpoint, is you're able to circumvent some of that,\" Boerner said. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNBC last week, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients, and that TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" Ricks said.",

Analysts polled by StreetAccount had expected $34.93 billion. AWS represented about 17% of Amazon's total revenue for the quarter.Operating income within AWS came to $12.47 billion, more than StreetAccount's $11.91 billion consensus, accounting for most of its parent company's profits. AWS' operating margin widened slightly to 35% from 34.6% in the third quarter.Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market, which its introduced almost 20 years ago, but Google and Microsoft have rapidly growing businesses in the space and, according to many analysts, are seeing stronger growth from artificial intelligence services. On Wednesday, Alphabet said revenue from the Google Cloud group, which includes Google Workspace productivity software bundles along with Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, jumped about 48%, the fastest growth since 2021. Microsoft said last week that revenue from Azure and other cloud services expanded 39%.During the fourth quarter, AWS introduced Nova Forge, which provides access to Amazon generative AI models during the training stage for advanced customization, and announced a $38 billion spending commitment from OpenAI. The major cloud providers have all been rushing to offer more AI infrastructure to model builders such as Anthropic and OpenAI. AWS CEO Matt Garman said on Tuesday that AWS added almost 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025. \"Just for perspective, that's twice what we had 2022, when we were an $80 billion annual run rate business,\" Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said on a conference call with analysts. \"We expect to double it again by the end of '27.\"Last week Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the software company brought almost a gigawatt online through the fourth quarter.Amazon foresees $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditures, mainly in AWS, Jassy said. The sum was far above Visible Alpha's $148.86 billion consensus.\"Some of it is for our core workloads, which are non-AI workloads, because they're growing at a faster rate than we anticipated,\" Jassy said. \"But most of it is in AI, and we just have a lot of growth, a lot of demand.\"WATCH: AWS in focus for Amazon earningswatch now",

    "body": "Newly appointed Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra after addressing a press conference, in Mumbai on Dec. 11, 2024.Indranil Mukherjee | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's central bank on Friday kept its policy rates steady, as trade deals with the E.U. and the U.S. are set to support the world's fastest growing large economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the policy rate to remain unchanged at 5.25%. \"External headwinds have intensified, though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well\" for overall economic outlook, said Sanjay Malhotra, governor of Reserve Bank of India, explaining the reason for hitting a pause on the easing cycle.He added that in the near term, domestic inflation and growth outlook remain positive.\"Guidance was balanced, suggesting a prolonged pause is likely going forward,\" said Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank Singapore in an emailed response.The Reserve Bank of India cut benchmark rates by 125 basis points last year, and economists say the focus will now shift to transmission of the previous rate cuts.  Malhotra said the RBI \"will remain proactive in liquidity management\" and ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system \"to meet the productive requirements of the economy\" and to facilitate monetary policy transmission.\"We expect open market operations this quarter and the next,\" Rao of DBS Bank said.watch nowThe RBI will likely hold rates for at least a year, Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's \"Inside India.\" There was an \"outside chance of a rate cut,\" if the U.S.-India trade deal had not gone through, he added.Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington will cut tariffs on Indian exports to 18%, dispelling the central bank's worries around external headwinds to growth it had flagged in the last policy meet. The U.S. had levied 50% tariffs on India, amongst the highest across countries and more than on China with which it has had an adversarial relationship, souring ties between New Delhi and Washington.The RBI will focus on transmission of rates as the yields on long-term bonds are \"unlikely to come off,\" said Sengupta, as banks and insurance companies taper their buying of long-term government securities coupled while the supply of bonds is rising.India will borrow 17.2 trillion rupees ($187 billion) in the financial year starting April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech on Sunday. This figure marks an increase of 18% from the revised estimate for financial year 2026 and was higher than market estimates.In its December policy meet, the RBI cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25% in a unanimous decision, citing \"weakness in some key economic indicators.\"According to India's economic survey, released just days before the U.S.-India deal announcement, the country's economy is expected to grow by 7.4% in the fiscal year ending March 2026, and between 6.8% and 7.2% the following year. That puts India on track to keeping its crown of being the world's fastest growing large economy.The RBI has little to worry on the inflation front too. India's consumer inflation rose to 1.33% in December, slightly accelerating from 0.71% in the prior month. The central bank expects inflation for the current financial year at 2.1%, up from 2.0% forecast earlier. The food supply prospects \"remain bright\" in the near term, the RBI said in a release, adding that even core inflation was expected to remain in range, excluding volatility caused by prices of precious metals.",

The stake reportedly saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities.The chip deal came just months after Tahnoon's purchase in World Liberty Financial, prompting allegations of bribery. Prior U.S. administrations have warned against selling chips to the UAE, citing concern that they will fall into the hands of China. Tahnoon's own AI enterprise, G42, will receive chips as part of the deal. \"Why in the world was Donald Trump trying to ship off our state-of-the-art chips to the UAE — and China — when American startups, universities, and small businesses need them here at home?\" Warren is expected to ask on the floor when she introduces her resolution. A draft of it has been viewed by CNBC. \"Well, now we know that the UAE greased the skids months earlier when it secretly agreed to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a Trump family crypto venture just four days before President Trump's inauguration.\"President Donald Trump shakes hands with Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, National Security Advisor of UAE, next to UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, left, after arriving on Air Force One at Abu Dhabi International Airport, Thursday, May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.Alex Brandon | APIf agreed to on the Senate floor, the resolution would resolve that the Senate \"Condemns Donald Trump's decision to allow the sale of advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and calls for the reversal of this decision.\"The chip deal would send 500,000 of Nvidia's chips to the UAE annually, including the most advanced silicon the U.S. company makes. The U.S. is battling with China over AI dominance, and tightly guards its technology.Warren's push for a vote on the resolution is likely to be blocked on the Senate floor, where any senator could object to the measure. But it could put Republicans — who have also warned about AI chips reaching China — in a difficult spot. \"Trump is profiting from decisions that make it easier for countries like China to get their hands on some of our most sensitive and advanced technology,\" Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, is expected to say. \"Congress needs to grow a spine. We cannot allow American national security to be sold to the highest bidder,\" she's expected to add. The Trump administration has denied wrongdoing related to Tahnoon's purchase and the chip deal. Trump, asked about the deal this week, said, \"Well, I don't know about it.\" ",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesBitcoin briefly sank below $61,000 on Thursday evening as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as \"digital gold\" and a unique store of value. At one point, the token slid to $60,062.00, as the crypto sell-off intensified in overnight trading. Bitcoin was last down about 15% at 7:37 p.m. ET, trading at $62,448.00.Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.The cryptocurrency broke below the key level of $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased, bringing the asset closer in line with its pre-election level. The cryptocurrency is down almost 30% this week alone.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin, 1 day\"This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.Bitcoin underperforming gold Bitcoin is down nearly 40% over the past year, while gold futures have gained 61% in the same period. Other cryptocurrencies are cratering, too. Ether has pulled back 33% this week. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low. That cryptocurrency is off nearly 40% on the week.Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch for bitcoin, and a break below that could trigger further declines. James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a \"key psychological level,\" adding that \"if we fail to hold it, a move toward\" the $60,000 to $65,000 range \"becomes quite likely.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe price of bitcoin over the last year. The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) dropped 1.8% on Thursday, marking its third straight losing day.Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 50% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more. \"[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,\" Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange.\"watch nowInstitutional demand reversesWhile many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.\"Institutional demand has reversed materially,\" CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.The report notes other worrying signs. \"Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase,\" CryptoQuant analysts said. A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests \"potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range,\" CryptoQuant said.",

    "body": "An Amazon Go store in New York, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLayoff plans hit their highest January total since the global financial crisis while hiring intentions reached their lowest since the same period, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs for the month, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025. The total marked the highest for any January since 2009, while the economy was in the final months of its steepest downturn since the Great Depression.At the same time, companies announced just 5,306 new hires, also the lowest January since 2009, which is when Challenger began tracking such data. The crisis recession officially ended in March 2009.With the recent narrative centering on a no-hire, no-fire labor market, the Challenger data suggests that the layoff part of the equation could be stepping up.\"Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for the firm. \"It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.\"To be sure, if employers are stepping up plans to furlough workers, it hasn't been showing up much in official government data. watch nowHowever, initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 31 totaled a seasonally adjusted 231,000, the highest since early December though the spike likely had something to do with a brutal winter storm that hit large parts of the country. The longer-term trend still was at its lowest since October 2024.Some high-profile layoff announcements have boosted fears of wider damage in the labor market. Amazon, UPS and Dow Inc. recently have announced sizeable job cuts. Indeed, transportation had the highest level from a sector standpoint in January, due largely to plans from UPS to cut more than 30,000 workers. Technology was second on the back of Amazon's announcement to shed 16,000 mostly corporate level jobs.Planned hiring dropped 13% from January 2025 and was off 49% from December.Challenger data also can be volatile and not correlated to official statistics. However, filings with the Labor Department in January under Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification regulations indicate more than 100 companies have given notice of significant layoffs.In a separate report Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings fell sharply in December to 6.54 million, a slide of 386,000 on a monthly basis and down more than 900,000 from the October level. Openings are now at their lowest since September 2020.The decrease in available positions put the ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers at 0.87 to 1, down from more than 2 to 1 at its peak in mid-2022.  On Wednesday, ADP reported that private employers added just 22,000 jobs in January.watch now",

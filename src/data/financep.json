    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) Heads of State Council at the Yntymak Ordo (Palace of Unity) presidential residence in Bishkek on November 27, 2025. Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

    "body": "Being a great leader takes time and practice, and a growing share of workers are trying to get better at it.Search interest in the term \"leadership\" is at an all-time high, according to Google data, along with related terms like training, best practices, advice on how to lead a team and sources for professional development.The buzz likely stems from people wanting to lead during a time of rapid business changes due to remote and hybrid policies in offices, global politics, changing economic circumstances and the adoption of technology like AI, says Brian Glaser, Google's chief learning officer.Glaser has been a manager off and on for the last 20 years and leads the onboarding, training and leadership development for some 150,000 employees worldwide. As a leadership expert, Glaser tells CNBC Make It that people of all experience levels struggle with one main aspect of being a boss: delivering \"really effective feedback so that people are clear about where they stand.\"Instead, many managers shy away from critical or constructive feedback in the pursuit of being well liked.\"As a leader, being nice is great,\" Glaser says. That can lead you to be liked among your reports, but \"the name of the game is really to be respected.\"\"If you're not delivering the feedback, you may not get the kind of respect you need as a manager,\" he says. This can be tough for first-time managers or someone who's been promoted and is now overseeing the work of former peers.But teams can grow stagnant or repeat avoidable mistakes \"if you're only looking to tell people what's working and not necessarily delivering the hard stuff,\" Glaser says.Glaser's team is behind Google's latest People Management Essentials, a paid course available to the public that covers lessons from over a dozen Google bosses about what it takes to be an excellent leader.Some of the lessons about delivering solid feedback are inspired by sports psychology, Glaser says.\"We know the best athletes are the folks who receive constant feedback from their coaches about how they're performing, he says. Win or lose, \"every time they finish a game, they debrief, they talk about what worked and what didn't. We believe those same concepts can be applied to organizational life.\"Talking about areas for improvements helps ensure stronger performance outcomes in the future. Athletes including Super Bowl champ Tom Brady and Team USA Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas have discussed that learning from mistakes and failures fueled their successes.In the workplace, meanwhile, telling a report that \"they need to improve can be challenging,\" Glaser says, \"but we know through good practice, managers can do this, and it really matters.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Miniseries | GettyMany people saving in 401(k) accounts get a company match from their employer. But that money may not yet belong to them.A person may have to remain employed with a company for up to six years — nearly twice as long as the typical private-sector worker stays in a job — to take full control of those matching funds, which may pose an additional financial hit for those laid off in a cooling labor market. The 401(k) match is often referred to as \"free\" money: Employees who contribute to their 401(k) plan may get a matching contribution to their account from their employer, up to a certain amount.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageThat 'free' money in your 401(k) may not belong to you just yetAI data center 'frenzy' is pushing up your electric bill — here's why'Buyers may be a little disappointed' by Black Friday car deals: analystIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

Depending on the match terms and a worker's earnings, the match money at stake could be worth thousands of dollars per year — and even more when compounded over decades of investing. The most common employer match formula — used by about 20% of employers — is to match half of the first 6% of a worker's salary, according to the PSCA. So, if a worker has 6% of each paycheck deposited into their 401(k), the employer would contribute an additional 3% to the 401(k).However, while workers may see the matching funds reflected in their 401(k) balance, most don't take ownership of it immediately. Just 44% of employers that pay a 401(k) match offered so-called \"immediate full vesting\" in 2024, according to PSCA data issued in November. In other words, all of the matching funds contributed by an employer belong to the worker immediately. Workers can take that money with them if they leave.For the rest, it may take many years — perhaps up to five or six — to own their full match. \"There might be a service requirement,\" said Hattie Greenan, the PSCA's director of research. \"It's often used as a way to reduce turnover, depending on the industry you're in.\"watch nowIn lieu of immediate full vesting of a 401(k) match, many companies offer \"graduated vesting.\" That means employees take ownership of their match in tranches over a number of years.For example, 15% of companies offer graduated vesting over a five-year period, according to PSCA data; an employee might gain 20% of their match per year for five years. Another 14% of companies offer six-year graduated vesting. Others have \"cliff\" vesting, meaning they give ownership of the full match to workers after the workers reach a specific tenure, but pay none before workers reach that length of service.About 10% of companies offer three-year cliff vesting, and another 7% offer two-year cliff vesting, according to the PSCA.The typical private-sector worker had a tenure of 3.5 years in early 2024, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Leaving a job too soon or being laid off could be costly for retirement savings. The U.S. labor market has shown signs of weakness lately. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, reported that job cuts in October were the highest for the month in 22 years. It has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009, the firm said. Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest point since April amid anxiety over the job market.",

    "body": "Bestselling author and wellness leader Deepak Chopra is optimistic about the possibilities of artificial intelligence. \"The thing is, AI is here to stay,\" he says. Chopra believes that while the technology can be harmful, it can also be beneficial when used very specifically for self-discovery. Chopra recommends using AI chatbots to get to know yourself better, suggesting questions like, \"What is my purpose?\" and \"How can I cultivate self-compassion?\"Chopra recently launched an online wellness platform that offers meditations, community discussion boards and live sessions led by Chopra himself. And he's bullish enough on AI to have created his very own Deepak Chopra chatbot. Unlike large language models such as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, Chopra's bot is what's called a small language model. Instead of training the bot on all of human knowledge, it's trained on Chopra's work, specifically.\"I've written 95 plus books,\" he says. \"I've done innumerable conferences. I have thousands of videos on YouTube and LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok. So I fed all that into my AI.\" Chopra platform subscribers pay $10 monthly, which includes chatbot access. Non-subscribers can pay from 50 cents per 30-minute session to $6 a month to use the bot.The thing is, AI is here to stay.Deepak ChopraAuthor, wellness guruUsers can choose from a series of existing prompts on subjects including success, relationships, sex and spirituality, or they can simply put in their own question. Answers come back in text format and can also be played out loud in Chopra's voice. But Chopra says the bot does have its limits: \"We will not be doing suicide prevention,\" he says. \"That's for professionals.\" Chopra's chatbot will not offer psychotherapy either, he says.Instead, Chopra says you can give the bot prompts like \"I haven't slept in five days, can you give me a meditation?\" or \"I'm having difficulty in my relationship because we're not communicating.\" \"Then, we give you guidelines,\" he says. Ultimately, Chopra says he wants people to cultivate empathy, compassion, joy and peace of mind, and that he wants to be a resource for users around the clock. \"You have me as your companion in your pocket all the time,\" he says.He adds that he wouldn't mind continuing to be a presence in his family's life. \"My grandchildren's grandchildren will be able to have a conversation with me long after I'm gone,\" he says.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% is likely to be defeated. A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile.

    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "Black Friday early morning shoppers rush in as the doors are opened at a Walmart store in Fairfax, Virginia, Nov. 28, 2008.Gerald Martineau | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBlack Friday has long been defined by massive crowds, rock-bottom prices and rabid consumers willing to bite, scratch and claw their way to the best deals of the season. But these days, retail's biggest holiday looks a bit different. Stores are opening their doors later, foot traffic is flat, online shopping is up and, in a world where Black Friday begins in September, consumers are wary, unsure if the deals they're getting are even that good. \"The integrity of the event is pretty much gone,\" said Mark Cohen, former CEO of Sears Canada, who spent a decade as the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \"Back in the day, a Black Friday price was the best you could ever find on something ... never to be seen again. In today's day and age, promotional pricing just gets better and better from a consumer's point of view the closer you get to the holiday.\"A line forms for the 4 a.m. Black Friday opening at Kohl's department store in Pleasanton, California, Nov. 27, 2009.Michael Macor | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesWhile Black Friday remains a critical day for many retailers and is still arguably the most popular shopping day of the year, it's no longer defined by the in-person experience. Millions of shoppers are expected to visit malls, big-box stores and specialty retailers on Friday, but millions more are expected to stay at home and shop online from their phones and computers. That means a shift in strategy for retailers that have long gone all in on Black Friday, including Walmart, Target and Macy's. Some, such as Kohl's, are launching their holiday sales earlier in the season. Others, such as Walmart, are spacing out promotions in separate events — one in mid-November, another over the holiday weekend and a final, one-day event on Cyber Monday. Many others planned to stay closed on Thanksgiving but still had deals online during the holiday. \"I still recall queuing up outside stores waiting for those special deals that every retailer would advertise,\" said Denish Shah, the department chair and professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business. \"Whereas now it goes over weeks, over multiple days, and most of the time the consumers are doing it from the comfort of their home through online sales.\" For the last six years, more people shopped online on Black Friday than in-store, and foot traffic has been relatively flat following a post-Covid spike, according to data from the National Retail Federation and Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations.Since 2021, Black Friday store visits have consistently been more than 50% higher than the daily average for the full year, but the amount of foot traffic stores are getting on the day after Thanksgiving isn't really growing, data from Placer.ai shows. From 2023 to 2025, the number of millennials and Generation X consumers planning to make the majority of their purchases on Black Friday has dropped. It's largely flat for Gen Z and baby boomer shoppers over that time period, according to data from the Bank of America Institute.Meanwhile, the amount of money people are spending during the so-called Turkey 5 – the period of shopping days spanning Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday – has declined for two straight years, according to the NRF. Between 2019 and 2024, spending fell nearly 13%. That decline is expected to continue this year, with consumers planning to spend 4% less on average during the Turkey 5, according to a recent Deloitte survey. \"There is still going to be a day of highlights from retailers, whether it is door busters, ... certain additional promotions, etc.,\" said Tiffany Yeh, a managing director and partner with Boston Consulting Group's consumer practice. \"But it is more muted.\" How Black Friday lost its edge When the modern-day version of Black Friday became popularized in the 1980s, it took an entire year of planning to pull off, Cohen said. \"The art was to convince a vendor to give you an enormous discount on cost so that you could create this tremendously compelling offer to the consumer that would then ... benefit you for the balance of the holiday season,\" he recalled. \"But it required an enormous amount of work.\" Retailers had to pick the perfect product, set the perfect price and make sure their competitors didn't get wind of their promotional plans. Then, they had to make sure they ordered enough inventory to sell out, but not so early that it would cause riots. Black Friday shoppers pour in to a Best Buy store in Los Angeles at 5 a.m. on Nov. 28, 2008.Jewel Samad | AFP | Getty ImagesBut over time, as Black Friday became more popular, retailers began extending the shopping holiday so their biggest sales tailwind of the year could last longer than a single day. First, stores opened earlier Friday morning, then they began opening on Thanksgiving, and then, promotions began the day before. When consumers began expecting discounts on more than a handful of products, promotions were spread to items in every department.\"In other words,\" Cohen said, \"to sustain the ride, they started to dilute it.\" As discounts spread across the store, the operational feat behind inventory and staffing became even more challenging to manage, leading retailers to spread out promotions even earlier, Yeh said. \"It's always been a tough one to really staff up labor so significantly for a short period of time,\" she said. \"If it's only for a day, people are not going to necessarily want to sign up for that, versus, if it's for a longer season, then you're more likely to get the necessary team members and also be able to train them.\"At the same time, consumer habits began to shift in the backdrop. Are Black Friday deals still worth it? Online shopping had been on a slow and steady rise for 20 years, but during the Covid-19 pandemic, adoption skyrocketed. Now, retailers don't need to put on as big of an in-person show on Black Friday, because online sales are increasingly outpacing those in stores. Stretching Black Friday into a seasonlong event also makes it easier for consumers to spread out their own spending, Shah said. \"November and December are two different pay periods for many consumers,\" he said. \"It makes a difference if they can spread their spending across two pay periods rather than just one.\" Of course, there's also debate about how good the discounts actually are on Black Friday, especially in a soft economy where retailers are leaning heavily on promotions to drive sales at the same time they're raising prices to offset tariffs. People crowd the first floor of Macy's department store in New York as they open for Black Friday sales at midnight on Nov. 23, 2012.Stan Honda | AFP | Getty Images\"Rampant discounting\" across the industry — before, during and after the holiday shopping season — has left many consumers feeling \"skeptical\" about promotions overall, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of consulting firm AlixPartners' global fashion practice. Some promotions this holiday season could also be disguising price increases, notching the cost back down to what it was before the ticket price was raised, said Lapinsky. \"They've had the power to cross-shop and look for these discounts, and now there's just this lack of trust,\" Lapinsky said. \"They're tired of doing that, and there's a lack of trust that they're actually getting the value piece of it.\" For example, brands like Gap, Levi Strauss and Under Armour started their Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving, and the promotions were comparable to those offered earlier in the season.\"The whole idea of creating urgency is kind of goofy and gone,\" Cohen said. \"Like so many headlines that purportedly offer a deal, the deal is something of a scam.\" ",

Puma forecast slower profit growth as new Chief Executive Officer Arne Freundt confronts excess inventory and higher costs for marketing sneakers and apparel. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPuma shares finished 18.9% higher on Thursday following a report that China's Anta Sports is among a number of firms looking to buy the struggling German athletic brand.Puma is in the middle of what is calls a \"reset,\" as sales growth has dramatically dropped after a revenue bump during Covid-19. Post-pandemic, however, the brand has wrestled with fading customer resonance with customers and resulting high inventories.Earlier this month, shares hit their lowest level in more than 10 years, while year-to-date losses amount to more than 50% amid an increasingly competitive sportswear market and tariffs hitting customer sentiment. The company is now reportedly considering a buy-out, according to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources. Hong Kong-listed Anta Sports is said to weigh a potential bid for the sportswear maker, the outlet reported. Puma declined to comment and Anta Sports didn't immediately to respond to a CNBC request for comment.watch nowFor Anta, acquiring Puma could be a gateway to the Western world, said Metzler analyst Felix Dennl, noting the Chinese company's strong track record in turning around underperforming assets. \"On the one hand, Anta already has broad-based international market exposure via its stake in Amer Group, hence the additional value add from Puma is expected to add to the portfolio is not completely clear,\" he added.Puma may also attract interest from Chinese apparel firm Li Ning and Japan's Asics Corp, the Bloomberg report said. \"As of now, the company has not engaged in any substantive negotiations or evaluations regarding the transaction mentioned in the news,\" Li Ning said in an emailed statement. Asics said that \"there are no discussions or plans regarding the acquisition of Puma at ASICS.\"Puma's Frankfurt-listed shares ended the Thursday session up 18.9% at 20.22 euros. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPuma shares year-to-datePuma CEO Arthur Hoeld, who was appointed on July 1, is tasked with reviving the ailing brand. His turnaround plan involves cutting jobs, narrowing its product range, and improving marketing operations.\"At the end of July, we stated that 2025 would be a year of reset,\" Hoeld said in a statement on Oct. 30. \"Since then, we have taken important steps to clean up PUMA's distribution, improve our cash management and reset our operational expenses. By expanding our cost efficiency programme, we are moving quickly to address challenges and make the business more efficient and resilient.\"The company also said it is aiming to establish itself as a \"Top 3 global sports brand,\" as it reported quarterly sales that fell on a double digit basis. Puma acknowledged that key challenges included a muted brand momentum, U.S. tariffs, and high inventory levels.In July, the company cut its 2025 guidance, saying its now expecting a sales decline at a low double-digit percentage rate, from a previous guide of sales growth at a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate. It also said it expects to post an operating profit loss in 2025 — a huge swing from the previously expected profit of between 445 million euros ($516 million) and 525 million euros — due to the impact of tariffs. Puma's biggest shareholder is currently Artemis which holds a 29% stake in the company. Artemis — the holding company of France's billionaire Pinault family as well as the largest shareholder of Gucci-owner Kering — has been on a spending spree and has seen its debt balloon. Artemis' valuation expectations for Puma may be a major hurdle to any transaction involving the athletic brand, Bloomberg reported.-- Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10? Is that not going out to eat?\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Boaz Weinstein is calling for the removal of the entire board of a tech-focused fund managed by Baillie Gifford, in a bid to reverse what the activist investor sees as \"unprecedented\" value destruction.In a letter to the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust's board on Thursday, Weinstein — whose activist investment firm Saba Capital owns around 30% of shares in the trust — said the board has \"objectively and categorically failed\" to deliver the performance expected by shareholders.EWIT's portfolio comprises a global mix of smaller and emerging public and private companies focused on tech innovation and transformation, that target \"significant disruptive growth potential,\" according to the London-listed Baillie Gifford's website. Its holdings include Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which makes up 8.4% of its portfolio.Weinstein said EWIT's net asset value is down 30.8% over the past five years, while its share price return has fallen 35%, having \"massively underperformed\" its self-selected benchmark, the FTSE All-Share Index, which is up 71.4% over the same period.That means the company's NAV return and share price performance ultimately lag the benchmark by more than 100% over the five-year period, Saba noted in the letter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.\"The magnitude of this value destruction is unprecedented among peer U.K. equity investment trusts over this period,\" Weinstein wrote.Jonathan Simpson-Dent, chair of EWIT, expressed disappointment with Saba's open letter.He said EWIT's benchmark is the S&P Global Small Cap Index — not the FTSE All-Share Index cited in Weinstein's letter.\"It makes little sense to judge a global small-cap trust against a U.K. all-cap benchmark,\" Simpson-Dent said in a statement, adding that EWIT's NAV total return has been 17.5% to date, ahead of the S&P Global Small Cap Index's 4.8%. A Saba Capital spokesperson told CNBC: \"In its latest 2024 Annual Report, EWI compared company performance, specifically share price return, to the FTSE All-Share Index on page 79 citing it as 'a widely used measure of performance for UK listed companies'.\"The spokesperson said that EWI's share price return has underperformed the FTSE All-Share Index on a one-, three- and five-year period, and the S&P Global Small Cap Index on both a three- and five-year period, \"including by more than 60% over the five-year.\"'Constructive dialog'The trust's total assets stood at £847.15 million ($1.1 billion) as of Oct. 31. Weinstein is calling for a general meeting to appoint a new board composed solely of \"qualified, independent directors… committed to delivering long-term value for all shareholders.\"\"We remain profoundly frustrated by the board's prolonged inertia,\" the activist investor wrote in the letter on Thursday. \"We do not have faith in the current Board's ability to implement the necessary strategic changes.\"Simpson-Dent said EWIT's board will continue to seek \"constructive dialog\" with Weinstein toward an \"equitable and holistic\" solution, including return of capital. But he warned: \"While we are open to discuss Board composition with Saba, we would strongly reject any proposal to replace the entire Board and the ambiguity that would follow.\"He added: \"The company's actions over the last year have supported a tightly managed discount, currently 5.6%, significantly narrower than the Global Smaller Companies peer group weighted average discount of 10.9%.\"The move follows an earlier attempt by Saba last year to shake up the EWI trust's board, a bid which ultimately failed to win investor support.Weinstein — whose New York-based $6 billion hedge fund trades credit relative value opportunities — has built a number of positions across the U.K. investment trust space lately. Outlining two new bets at the annual Sohn London investment conference last week, he said there is \"a storm brewing\" in the U.K. investment trust sector where discounts have widened sharply.",

Warehouse tenants are now more focused on efficiency, power and location than they are on square footage. New development has slowed down, and federal policies are pushing onshoring of manufacturing, which helps the sector counter still-high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Rent increases are no longer as steep as they were a few years ago, and in some markets they are actually falling slightly due to oversupply.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Industrial property rents are showing signs of stabilization, indicating a more balanced market environment,\" said Judy Guarino, managing director of commercial mortgage lending at JPMorgan Chase, in a note to investors.Here's what to watch for in warehouses in 2026. Big-boxThe big-box subsector refers to large, modern distribution and warehouse facilities that serve as hubs for logistics, storage and e-commerce fulfillment. It makes up about a quarter of the total industrial warehouse space in the U.S. Vacancies are close to cyclical peaks and new construction is contracting, according to industry data. In the first half of this year, new supply still outpaced new demand, but the gap shrank, according to new research from Colliers. Third-party logistics firms, including delivery services such as Ryder and DHL moving goods on behalf of a client, are leading that demand.\"The third-quarter demand has far exceeded the entire first half of the year, which is another really strong indicator that the supply and demand is starting to get more into a balanced state,\" said Stephanie Rodriguez, national director of industrial services at Colliers. Across the 20 largest markets, the overall big-box vacancy rate rose 19 basis points to 11% during the first half of the year, according to Colliers. New supply totaled 48 million square feet in the first half of 2025, much less than the 330 million square feet completed at the height of the cycle in 2023. Rents are expected to stabilize in the near term before starting to grow again. Big-box is a major segment of the overall warehouse real estate market, particularly driven by demand from online retailers and companies seeking efficient supply chain operations. Recent economic and tariff policies have definitely shaken that demand, but as those policies settle, more demand could return. Lower interest rates would be another driver. Supply chainSupply chain, which relies heavily on warehouse real estate, is also seeing something of a transformation that could increase demand. In a report titled \"Bold Predictions for 2026,\" Prologis, the world's largest logistics real estate company, cited specific supply chain trends to watch, including forecasts that:E-commerce companies will make up nearly 25% of new leasing next year as the proportion of goods sold online rises to almost 20% globally by year-end.The need for power-ready logistics facilities capable of supporting automation and manufacturing will be a top-three factor globally in location selection.Defense-related demand in the U.S. and Europe will breathe new life into older industrial corridors and produce a new class of specialized logistics assets.Shrinking trucking capacity will drive double-digit rate hikes in 2026, making transportation an even larger share of total supply chain spend and amplifying the value of well-located logistics real estate.PowerPower is emerging as a leading driver across real estate portfolios. Beyond the usual narrative of e-commerce and the data center sector, power availability and network densification are becoming important pricing catalysts, according to a recent report from Hines, a global real estate investment manager.\"While re/near-shoring demand continues to pick up speed, albeit slowly and with somewhat uneven impact, opportunity also lies in power-advantaged infill assets that support faster and denser networks; where distance once drove advantage, closeness now creates it,\" according to the Hines report. ReshoringFurther research from Hines shows that warehouse net absorption has correlated to manufacturing construction spend. \"This trend highlights another potential source of demand not only for industrial manufacturing facilities, but for the warehouse subsector as well,\" according to its report, which predicts reshoring alone could increase overall warehouse demand over the next five years by roughly 35%.\"Despite the volatility in the macroeconomic landscape, driven by interest rate and trade policy uncertainties, industrial properties near ports remain vital,\" Guarino said. \"Tariffs may lead to higher costs and supply chain challenges, but these locations are key to maintaining supply chain resilience and adapting to trade shifts.\"ProximityOne example of the proximity advantage: Amazon. Its logistics real estate strategy mirrors a broader national trend, prioritizing efficiency, automation and consumer proximity over sheer scale, according to a note from CoStar.\"It's an interesting inflection point for industrial developers and REITs that rode the pandemic-era boom,\" wrote Juan Arias, CoStar Group's national director of industrial analytics. Arias highlighted a leasing slowdown, noting that this year Amazon has occupied just 61 logistics properties, down from 100 in 2024 and as many as 300 in recent years. Its demand for larger footprint facilities hit a seven-year low, but it is still drawn to newer, taller buildings, with an emphasis on modern, efficient distribution centers, Arias said.AIAs with everything else, artificial intelligence and property technology are making an imprint on the warehouse sector as well. They are helping owners and operators to analyze supply chains, traffic patterns and data more efficiently — particularly important in identifying potential warehouse locations. They are also helping to manage inventory and predict maintenance needs, both of which reduce costs. ",

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Five years before Abi Caswell opened her own bakery, she had never made a single cookie. Today, she owns and manages two bake shops that bring in seven figures in sales, she says.Caswell, 30, is the founder of Batter, a bakery with two storefronts in Hammond, Louisiana and in New Orleans.Her ultimate goal has always been to own her own business, she tells CNBC Make It. \"Since I was a kid, I always knew I wanted to work for myself,\" she says. \"I wanted to be able to control my schedule, and I wanted to make my own money.\"Her interest in sweet treats began as a teenager: Caswell worked at a local cupcake shop from ages 16 to 20 and \"loved everything about it,\" though she wasn't involved in the baking process.After graduating from Louisiana State University of Alexandria in 2018 with a major in business administration and a minor in marketing, Caswell moved to Hammond with her husband Trey.While working full-time as an executive assistant, Caswell started experimenting with baking her own cakes as a hobby.After she made a cake for a friend's husband, \"one of our mutual friends was like, 'This is so good. You've got to sell these. We have nothing like this here,'\" Caswell recalls. Caswell initially planned to stick to cakes and cupcakes, she says, but with the rise of popular cookie chains like Crumbl and Insomnia Cookies — neither of which had storefronts in Hammond at the time, Caswell notes — she decided to capitalize on the craze and make cookies the focus of her baking side hustle.Courtesy of Abi CaswellFrom home baker to business owner In fall 2021, Caswell started experimenting with cookie recipes with the help of her husband Trey, who works as a high school basketball coach. It took Caswell six months to develop her now-signature chocolate chip cookie recipe.\"We made so many batches of cookies that were terrible,\" she says. \"They would just never be quite right because I had no clue what I was doing. So every time I made one, I just learned something new about it.\"She began posting her bakes online and on social media, and says she quickly attracted a strong local customer base.In spring 2022, Caswell left her full-time executive assistant job to focus on baking.\"I was going to work from 8 to 5:30 [p.m.], and then I was coming home and baking till like 1 a.m.,\" she recalls. \"It was just too much.\"Around the time Caswell left her job, she landed a spot at the farmer's market in Hammond. Every Friday, she baked 500 cookies with her husband's help to sell at the market on Saturday, and they regularly sold out within 30 minutes, she says.\"That was when I realized, we've got to get in a store. Like, this is not sustainable. We have to find another way to sell,\" Caswell says.The Batter storefront in Hammond, LA.Courtesy of Abi Caswell.It wasn't easy for Caswell to secure a storefront in Hammond. Caswell developed a business plan to open a bakery with the help of her local small business development center, but she had no money saved at the time and several banks rejected her request for a loan.Finally, a bank representative helped her secure a $40,000 loan, for which Caswell says she had to put up her house as collateral, to rent a storefront and install baking appliances. In November 2022, Caswell officially opened her first Batter shop in downtown Hammond with a team of eight employees — a head baker and seven part-time bakery clerks. She had just turned 27 years old.Scaling the businessCaswell was \"running off adrenaline\" for the first few months, she says. She spent up to 18 hours a day working at the bakery to keep up with demand.\"We couldn't keep anything in stock,\" she says. \"We had an amazing time, but it was very, very stressful.\" Batter brought in mid-six figures in its first year of operation, according to Caswell, and she was able to pay off her bank loan entirely by May 2023.After the success of the Hammond location, Caswell opened another Batter location in New Orleans in December 2024 with the goal of reaching a larger customer base.Last year, the two locations collectively brought in seven figures in yearly sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Some of Caswell's cookie creationsCourtesy of Abi CaswellCaswell estimates that she sells over a thousand baked goods each day. Cookies, cupcakes, cakes, petit fours and pull-apart loaves are staples on Batter's menu year-round, she says, but they also offer seasonal treats like a king cake-inspired cookie for Mardi Gras. The bakery's signature chocolate chip cookies cost $3.75 each.Batter also sells cake balls, croissants and homemade pop tarts that Caswell sources from other local women-owned bakeries, and both locations serve coffee.Right now, Caswell is close to achieving a longtime dream: developing her signature chocolate chip cookie recipe into a wholesale mix.She says her first drop of 150 bags of cookie mix, which she sells for $14.99 each, quickly sold out online, and her goal is to get the product into grocery stores this year.\"Before I ever opened Batter, I always said to my husband, 'We're going to be on these shelves one day,'\" she says.Developing a mix will make her cookies \"more accessible,\" rather than being tied to a storefront, Caswell says.'Never truly off the clock'One trait that Caswell believes is crucial to her success is adaptability.\"A lot of being a business owner is what your tolerance level is for your plans to change, for things to pop up and things to go wrong,\" she says.Running both bakeries hasn't been easy – \"every day there's something new going on,\" Caswell says.Caswell currently doesn't have a cake decorator for the New Orleans store, so she's filling the position herself until she can hire a new decorator.Caswell typically splits her time between both stores, which are an hour's drive apart, but since her New Orleans store is understaffed, Caswell has been working at that location \"pretty much full-time\" every day of the week, she says. That's the \"joy of being a small business owner,\" she jokes: you're \"never truly off the clock.\"Caswell holds a bag of her signature chocolate chip cookie mix.Courtesy of Abi CaswellOnline marketing has always been a key element of her business, Caswell says: it's how she reached many of her early customers, and she credits her social media reach for boosting her business to this day.Caswell currently has almost 300,000 followers on her TikTok account, where she posts about her daily routine, shares behind-the-scenes baking videos and opens up about the challenges of running her bakeries.Beyond promoting her bakes, Caswell's goal is to show her audience what it really takes to run a small business.\"I try to be as honest as I can be on social media,\" she says. \"I really think that people don't understand the mental undertaking, but also the time commitment.\" When you own a business, \"there is no real downtime,\" Caswell says. \"Even when I'm on vacation, if the stores are open, I'm on the clock.\"Most of the time, \"the losses hurt more than the wins feel good,\" she continues, but Caswell's goal for this year is to give herself a chance \"to relish what we've done.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "One kilogram gold bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery, operated by Gold Corp.Matt Jelonek | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold climbed to a fresh all-time high, crossing $5,000 an ounce on Monday and extending its record-breaking run as investors seek the safety of the yellow metal amid rising geopolitical tensions and global fiscal risks.Spot gold prices and U.S. gold futures for February gained 1.2%, trading at $5,042 and $5,036 an ounce, respectively. The precious metal's surge comes as recent flashpoints from Greenland and Venezuela to the Middle East underscore higher geopolitical risk, reinforcing gold's appeal as a hedge against uncertainty.\"The recent further leg up in gold and silver prices has arrived on the back of geoeconomics issues related to Greenland,\" HSBC wrote in a note last week.Silver also rallied Monday, with spot prices jumping 3% to $106.1 per ounce, also benefiting from industrial demand.Analysts at Union Bancaire Privée said Friday that prices have rallied on the back of sustained demand from both institutional and retail buyers.\"We anticipate that gold should enjoy another strong year, reflecting ongoing central bank and retail investment demand, with a year-end target price of USD 5,200 per ounce,\" UBP said.Goldman Sachs sees the demand base for gold to have broadened beyond traditional channels. Western ETF holdings have climbed by about 500 tonnes since the start of 2025, while newer instruments used to hedge macro-policy risks, including physical purchases by high-net-worth families, have become an increasingly important source of demand.The investment bank recently lifted its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 an ounce, up from $4,900 previously, arguing that hedges against global macro and policy risks have become \"sticky,\" effectively lifting the starting point for gold prices this year.Central bank purchases also remain robust. Goldman estimates central-bank purchases are now averaging around 60 tonnes a month, far above the pre-2022 average of 17 tonnes, with emerging-market central banks continuing to shift reserves into gold.Crucially, the bank assumes that hedges against global macro-policy risks, including concerns around fiscal sustainability, will remain in place through 2026, unlike election-related hedges that unwound quickly after the U.S. vote in late 2024.\"We assume that hedges of global macro policy risks remain stable as these perceived risks (e.g. fiscal sustainability) may not fully resolve in 2026,\" Goldman said last week.",

    "body": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations create closeness and intimacy.To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own.In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us.1. 'They are who they are.'Your partner's mistakes aren't yours to carry, and their successes aren't yours to claim. They are their own person living alongside you, not an extension of you.Similar phrases:\"She's always been like that.\"\"I know that's one of his favorite things to do.\"2. 'I'm not surprised at all!'When you really understand your partner, you're not likely to be taken aback by what they say or do. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. Similar phrases: \"Oh yeah, that's my mate alright!\"\"That's totally her style.\"3. 'They're quirky like that.'Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. But if you really know your partner, you notice those details and often find affection in them.Similar phrases:\"They sneeze like a train!\"\"His hiccups are kind of adorable.\"4. 'I trust them to be themselves.'Deep knowledge builds trust. When you know your partner, you trust them to act authentically and responsibly, whether you're together or apart.Similar phrases:\"She can be a little intense, but I trust her to make good choices.\"\"I know they'll be respectful.\" 5. 'That is a core value.'Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Even when you disagree, you can acknowledge what truly matters to them without dismissing or demeaning it.Similar phrases:\"I know this is really important to them.\"\"He's very passionate about politics.\"6. 'They struggle with that.'Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness.Similar phrases:\"I know this is painful for them.\"\"I see her struggle and want to support her through it.\"7. 'I can't change them.'Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it.Similar phrases:\"They'll change only if they want to.\"\"I accept that we see this differently, even if I don't like it.\" 8. 'I didn't know that about them!'Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.Similar phrases:\"I never realized they felt that way.\"\"Even though we've been married for years, I'm still learning new things about him.\"Want to get to know your partner better? Here are a few ways to start:Ask open-ended questions with genuine curiosity.Practice seeing situations from their perspective.Speak with respect during difficult conversations.Use physical touch, like hugging or holding hands, to bond.Show presence by putting down your phone, making eye contact and prioritizing time together.The answer to real intimacy is simple: You have to understand and choose each other, every day.Dr. Cortney S.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

    "body": "For many Americans, $1 million is seen as a savings benchmark for retirement. But in 32 U.S. states, the estimated minimum needed to retire at 65 is less than that.That's according to a state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates, which estimates the minimum household savings needed to retire at 65 and cover essential living expenses over 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health care. To determine savings minimums in each state, GOBankingRates looked at cost of living data for retirees 65 and older from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, minus average Social Security income. It then used a 4% annual withdrawal rate to estimate the total amount of savings needed to cover remaining expenses.These estimates focus on the minimum needed to cover day-to-day living costs, not a comfortable retirement. They exclude discretionary spending and don't account for factors like inheritances or paid-off mortgages.The analysis is also based on household expenses, meaning that retirement costs could be supported by more than one person's savings or income for a given home.Even so, basic living costs in retirement can exceed what many people expect. About half of U.S. workers say they'll need at least $500,000 to retire comfortably — not just cover essentials — according to a 2025 Bankrate survey.Here's a look at the U.S. states where the estimated minimum savings needed to retire at 65 comes in below $1 million.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure.The deadly shooting of Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was a U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday morning ignited already simmering concern among members of the Democratic caucuses in Congress about funding DHS. Democrats already were angry about the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman, by an ICE officer in that city on Jan. 7.\"Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement on Sunday.\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,\" he said. \"People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"Sen. Angus King of Maine told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, \"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] funding under these circumstances.\"\"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem,\" said King, one of two independents who caucuses with Democrats. \"We don't have to have a shutdown,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosKing played a key role in ending last year's 43-day shutdown.  He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.Members of the House, which went into a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would have to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It is unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or would do so. Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes appropriations for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury. \"No, I am not voting for this funding,\" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.\"The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier last week that the \"suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.\"\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said on X Saturday.\"I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate — Republicans must work with us to do that,\" she said.It was unclear if the Senate could split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up. It remains possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats. DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law passed last summer. But that is far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end the record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.\"I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,\" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown.\"Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.\"  Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Mark Carney, Canada's prime minister, after speaking in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCanada has \"no intention\" of pursuing a free trade deal with China, Prime Minister Mark Carney said, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap punitive tariffs on Ottawa.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Carney said that the country respects its obligations under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement, known as CUSMA in Canada and the USMCA in the U.S., and will not pursue a free trade agreement without notifying the other two parties. Carney's remarks come after Trump threatened to put a 100% tariff on Canadian exports if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with Beijing. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday.The remarks come against the backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and Canada, with Trump last week withdrawing the invitation to Ottawa to join his \"Board of Peace,\" after Carney in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos warned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.While Carney did not name any country, Trump said on the sidelines of the WEF that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"    Trump's fiery rhetoric on Truth Social contrasts with what he said after the agreement between Ottawa and Beijing earlier this month, \"that's what he [Carney] should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also echoed Trump's sentiments on Canada and China, telling ABC News on Sunday that the U.S could not \"let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.\"On Jan. 16, Ottawa and Beijing concluded a \"preliminary agreement,\"  with both sides lowering tariffs on select goods. Under the agreement, Canada will allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the market annually at a lowered tariff rate of 6.1%, after raising tariffs on such vehicles to 100% in October 2024 in conjunction with the U.S. In return, Beijing will cut duties on Canadian agricultural exports, including on canola seed oil, which will see tariffs drop to 15% from March 1, down from the current 85%. Other exports, such as Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas will also not be subject to Chinese anti-discrimination tariffs until at least the end of 2026.Carney said Sunday: \"What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that have developed in the last couple of years,\" adding that the deal was \"entirely consistent with CUSMA.\"In August 2025, Trump raised tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under CUSMA, but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries on Orion AR glasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 25, 2024. REUTERS/Manuel OrbegozoManuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future. \"I can see how it feels like a VR winter,\" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network. The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC reported. Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported. The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with EssilorLuxottica, a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement.Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO Mark Zuckerberg changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the metaverse. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses.Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway. Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer and head of Reality Labs at Meta Platforms Inc., during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta traditionally announces new Quest VR headsets during its annual Connect conference in the fall, but in 2025, the company skimped on VR hardware. Instead, Meta introduced its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that contain a single, built-in digital screen. \"If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,\" Young said. \"It already kind of does.\"Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR.\"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Bosworth told tech newsletter Sources. \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\"Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, who on Sunday wrote on X that Meta still employs the \"largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.\" Although Luckey said that he feels \"really bad for the people impacted\" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent \"a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.\"'The market has spoken'Market research firm IDC said in a December report that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays.IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025.Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing \"big, bulky headsets\" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said.\"The market has spoken,\" Ubrani said. \"There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.\"Visitors experience the new AR+AI glasses flagship product at the XREAL booth at WAIC 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 27, 2025. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAndrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a \"strategic mistake\" to compare VR headsets to iPhones The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous 1983 gaming market meltdown. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today.\"Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,\" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. \"When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.\"Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader video game industry slump. Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR.Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users.\"We're at the mercy of Meta,\" Eiche said, adding that it \"creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.\" Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company Valve will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the Samsung Galaxy XR, which debuted in October, and Apple's Vision Pro. But Apple's entry into the VR space in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped producing new Vision Pro headsets, signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool.\"Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,\" Ubrani said.watch nowVR's hope shifts to the enterprise market\"There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,\" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses. The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has \"seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.\"As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a support page that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings.Meta failed to realize \"how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,\" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a \"metaverse browser\" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments. As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like Roblox, Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform. Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related competitions intended to help improve the overall platform.But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era. \"Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,\" she said. \"Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.\"But Horizon lost is way, and \"what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,\" Young said.

    "description": "On Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. ",
    "body": "On Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. There's a wide gap between what Americans have seen of the shooting and what federal officials are telling them.Soon after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security officials rushed to defend the officers involved, claiming the victim \"approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun\" and that when federal agents attempted to disarm him, \"the suspect violently resisted.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem defended the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti, saying in a news conference that the agent fired \"defensive\" shots after the victim violently brandished a gun. \"The officers attempted to disarm this individual, but the armed suspect reacted violently,\" Noem said.In a separate press conference, Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino claimed Pretti may have wanted to do \"maximum damage\" and \"massacre law enforcement.\"But videos taken by bystanders, filmed from several different angles, tell a different story. In the first video verified by CNBC, protestors can be heard honking their horns on an urban Minneapolis street, while the video's author records through a car windshield as the car moves.watch nowAt 15 seconds, the camera pans to the left to show a man on the side of the street wearing a brown jacket and tan pants (believed to be Alex Pretti) holding up what appears to be a phone while being confronted by two federal agents. Pretti steps backwards away from the confrontation while appearing to yell at an agent.  At 21 seconds, the person filming the video drives past the confrontation, and the camera swings to the other side of the street as someone in the car yells profanities.  In a second video verified by CNBC, protestors can be heard blowing whistles and honking their horns at federal agents in a video on a cold Minneapolis street. At seven seconds, the video shows a man dressed in tactical gear believed to be a federal agent shove a woman wearing a brown jacket and black leggings in the back near the side of the street. She doesn't fall but moves several feet away because of the shove.  watch nowThe camera briefly shifts to the middle of the street before going back to the confrontation on the side at 11 seconds. The agent is face-to-face with one woman wearing a long cream jacket and charcoal pants. Next to her is a man in a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti, and next to him is the woman in brown jacket, black leggings who was shoved seconds ago.  At 12 seconds in the second video, the agent shoves the woman wearing the cream jacket to the ground. Pretti puts himself between the agent and the woman, who is on her back in a snowbank on the side of the road. At 14 seconds, the agent starts spraying Pretti in the face with a chemical agent. Pretti covers his face and turns away from the officer. Other agents wearing vests approach the confrontation. At 22 seconds, several agents are struggling with Pretti, attempting to bring him to the ground. He appears to fall to the ground, and at 28 seconds you see one agent apparently swinging a punch at his head while Pretti is down.  At this point, bystanders are recording, and whistles are making noise constantly. By 38 seconds, at least six agents seem to have restrained the man believed to be Pretti on the ground.One agent appears to take a weapon from Pretti and quickly walks away while holding the gun. A gunshot is heard at 40 seconds. It is unclear if the man holding the gun fired the shot. Following the first shot, more gunshots are heard in quick succession.  In a third video verified by CNBC, taken by someone on the street near the incident, protestors are blowing whistles at federal agents. watch nowAt 25 seconds, a man wearing a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti is holding his hand up in the middle of the street. He waves a car past and then starts walking. The camera then shifts away for a moment to a snowbank. A protestor can be heard shouting, \"What is wrong with you?\" At 33 seconds into the third video, Pretti has his arm around a woman in a dark green jacket and black leggings, apparently attempting to help her. He steps in front of a federal agent closing in on a woman who is on her back in the snowbank on the side of the road.  At 40 seconds, Pretti has his hand up to a federal agent who is spraying him with some kind of chemical agent. Two agents drag him onto his back and more agents join in a circle around the man in tan pants. A struggle takes place on the ground, with six agents surrounding the man in tan pants. At 60 seconds, one of the agents can be seen stepping back from the confrontation and he draws his gun and points it at Pretti. At 1:01, a single shot can be heard, followed by several in quick succession. The man on the ground, Pretti, slumps down.Amid screams, at 1:04, another flurry of gunshots can be heard.At no point in any of the three videos shown here does Alex Pretti brandish a weapon or appear to threaten federal immigration agents before the confrontation begins, as was claimed by DHS Sec. Noem and others in the Trump administration. One video also appears to show a federal officer removing a weapon from Pretti while he's being restrained by agents on the ground before any shots are fired. Pretti is a lawful gun owner and owns a permit for his weapon.",

    "body": "watch nowSoon, parents and guardians can open a Trump account for their children — and a number of large employers are piling on the incentives to get set up. For starters, babies born in 2025 through 2028 may receive a one-time $1,000 contribution from the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements, and all U.S. families are eligible for the initial seed money. But, in some cases, that is just the half of it. To help fund these savings accounts from the outset, a growing list of companies, including SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab, announced they will match the federal $1,000 contribution for employees' children.

Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025, — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution thanks to a $6.25 billion pledge made by tech CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Children in Connecticut may qualify for an additional donation from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and his wife, Barbara. Philanthropists in other states could follow suit as part of a \"50-state challenge,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a White House press conference last month. As it stands, those additional donations are geared toward families who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000. How to set up a Trump accountTrump accounts, also known as Section 530A accounts, were created to encourage early wealth building as part of President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed in July.To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named for Trump's presidential terms. The form also includes a check box for the $1,000 Treasury contribution for children born between 2025 and 2028.   Form 4547 can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return as soon as Jan. 26, which marks the official start of the 2026 tax filing season. Later in the year, this election can also be made via Trumpaccounts.gov.Once an account is established, parents, guardians, grandparents and others can contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit adjusts for inflation after 2027.As part of the $5,000 limit, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per worker per year, which won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. This figure also adjusts for inflation after 2027.Qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments can also make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.How much a Trump account may be worthExperts say the additional Trump account contributions could make a difference over time. For example, let's say a family receives $1,000 from the Treasury and a $1,000 matching contribution from their employer for a total of $2,000 during their baby's first year.That account could be worth about $6,800 after 18 years, assuming 7% annual returns, according to certified financial planner Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Many experts encourage families to accept \"free money\" from the Treasury, an employer or other sources. But beyond that, families can also weigh other investing options, such as 529 college savings plans and taxable brokerage accounts, among others, depending on their goals and timeline.

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) Activist: Engaged Capital  Ownership: 2.02% Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.What's happeningOn Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.Behind the scenesBlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to the press upon returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on January 13, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.\"Canada's government has transparently outlined that the agreement with China is fundamentally about domestic consumers and businesses in Canada and China, not schemes aimed at other markets,\" Matthew Holmes, executive vice president and chief of public policy of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.\"A structured and stable relationship with China or any other country ... are not to replace our deeply rooted relationship with the United States that continues to be overwhelmingly good for workers, consumers and North American competitiveness,\" he added.   The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosIn August 2025, Trump raised the tariff on Canadian goods to 35%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out.

    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

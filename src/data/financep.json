    "body": "This is the season when everyone's planning for next year. When it comes to money, I can assure you that the secret isn't in some fancy investing tactic, hot stock tip, or obscure cryptocurrency. If you and your partner set just one money resolution for 2026, make it this: You both stay actively involved in your finances.As a financial advisor for more than 20 years who's operated my own wealth management firm for nine, I know that this is the single most impactful commitment most couples can make. Yet it's missing in so many relationships. The dangers of disconnecting Leaving the money to be handled by one spouse leaves your family vulnerable. If something happens to the person handling everything (illness, death, or even divorce), the other is left to scramble. I've helped heartbroken spouses try to piece together accounts, passwords, and plans during the worst moments imaginable, and I wouldn't wish this outcome upon anyone. But even in less dramatic circumstances, it's still ineffective to leave one overwhelmed person to make all the decisions. You miss out on the power of two perspectives, and the disengaged spouse loses their agency and confidence. I've sat across from countless couples who, even with the best intentions, have lost the plot over time. Most of them never addressed the subtle shifts in their dynamic that made it easier for one partner to take the lead with their money. I'd often end up with just one client at our financial planning meetings, and their partner, I was told, was too busy, disinterested, apprehensive, or overwhelmed to join us. For a long time, I didn't understand why, until it happened in my own home. 'This isn't working anymore'During the pandemic, my wife, Heather, was juggling too much: lawyering in the general counsel's office of a Fortune 100 company, moonlighting as my business consultant for my wealth management firm, and keeping me and our two daughters clothed, fed, entertained, and safe. As a result of the physical, mental, and emotional labor she was carrying for all of us, she disconnected from our household finances. Money felt like the one thing she didn't have to worry about. In truth, it was the one thing I was willing to own from start to finish, and it was damaging to our relationship. I'm grateful she had the courage to say, \"This isn't working anymore.\" The tough conversations that followed caused us to rethink what we wanted out of our careers, how we divided labor, and how we could approach money as a team again. Make yourselves a money teamTalking about money is never just about money, which inspired Heather and me to spend two years interviewing other couples for our new book, \"Money Together: How to Find Fairness in Your Relationship and Become an Unstoppable Financial Team.\" Effective communication is the bedrock. Here are some ways to connect with intention, move beyond the numbers, and engage in your finances together — even when it's the harder thing to do.Start with an honest review. Schedule a distraction-free time and place to get into everything. Do you both have access to your accounts? Are all passwords saved in your password managers? You should both have a baseline understanding of your net worth. Review what you earn (cash flow), what you have (assets and investments), what you owe (debt), and what you want (goals). Examine time, from each of your perspectives. Ask whether each of you feels you have the time to do what you want and need to do. You may need to shuffle responsibilities and automate or outsource less-critical tasks to free up time for finances. Create a regular practice. Make recurring money dates non-negotiable. We suggest having them quarterly, which won't become overwhelming and will create enough space between meetings to recognize real progress.  Meet your partner where they are. I've often encountered couples where one partner has less knowledge or comfort with all things finances than the other, and that, in part, is why they've disengaged. It can feel daunting. Tailor your approach to your partner's learning style, checking in to see what resonates.Bring in outside help if needed. A neutral financial advisor or therapist who specializes in money dynamics can guide tough conversations without bias, and offer financial advice that's tailored to your specific situation. When Heather and I finally reconnected around money, it secured our wallets and also deepened our relationship. Make 2026 the year you prioritize staying connected to your finances together — I know from experience just how transformative it can be. Douglas A.

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

Silver futures were last trading around $70.97 an ounce.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver futures for March, year to dateThat has helped the precious metal outperform even gold this year. Gold futures for February, which recently topped $4,550 for the first time ever this month, are higher by more than 70% this year. Gold futures were last down by 4.5%.There are a number of reasons for the huge gains. Alongside gold, silver is viewed as a safe haven for investors wary of heightened geopolitical tensions and other risks, like the ballooning U.S. deficit. The two metals are also viewed as stores of value, meaning they can act as hedges against a U.S. dollar that weakens due to inflation or economic uncertainty. What's more, a weaker U.S. dollar also makes the assets cheaper for other countries. Silver also benefitted from strong industrial demand for electronics such as solar panels, data centers and electric vehicles. ",

    "body": "Zepto isn't the only quick commerce startup in India, and competition is heating up both domestically and globally. The country's online grocery market is set to be worth around $24 billion dollars by 2025, according to Redseer.ZeptoIndian quick-commerce startup Zepto has confidentially filed for an initial public offering, according to a public notice issued by the company on Sunday. The company plans to raise 110 billion rupees ($1.22 billion) of fresh capital. Zepto was valued at $7 billion during its last funding round in October, data from research firm Tracxn showed.Zepto told CNBC it filed its draft prospectus under the confidential route, which keeps its filings private, and declined to disclose further details. Rising competitionQuick commerce, which promises deliveries in as little as 10 minutes, has become one of India's most competitive consumer internet sectors.While e-commerce giant Amazon has long offered same-day delivery services in India through \"Amazon Fresh\", the launch of its 15-minute \"Amazon Now\" service in June marked an aggressive shift into a crowded space.The Jeff Bezos-owned U.S. company has started its quick commerce operations across Indian's three major cities—Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru.Amazon India's Country Manager Samir Kumar said on Dec. 1, that it plans to have well over 300 micro-fulfillment centers across Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai by the end of the year.\"India's quick commerce market is currently 10% of its e-commerce market, but in the medium to long term it could account for 40%-50%,\" Karan Taurani, executive vice president at Indian broking firm Elara Capital, told CNBC's Inside India last week.Walmart-owned Flipkart also launched its quick commerce service in 2024. Indian food delivery companies, Swiggy and Eternal, which owns Zomato and Blinkit, were among the first movers in this space.Over the last three to five years, several companies have entered the quick commerce market in India and are \" indulging in a price war\" as firms chase a large total addressable market, Taurani said.watch nowBubble concernsThe sector has continued to attract large sums of capital. Earlier this month, Swiggy raised 100 billion rupees from institutional investors to expand its quick commerce fulfilment network, including warehouses located closer to dense neighborhoods.But some industry leaders have warned that the pace of spending may not be sustainable. Blinkit Chief Executive Albinder Dhindsa has reportedly warned of a bubble bursting.He told Bloomberg that the quick commerce industry has relied heavily on \"relentless fundraising\" to cover steep losses and that companies would soon face limits on how long they can continue absorbing them.Zepto's losses reportedly widened in fiscal year 2025 to 33.67 billion rupees from 12.15 billion rupees a year ago. Data from LSEG showed that Swiggy reported a net loss of 31.17 billion rupees in FY25, up from 23.50 billion rupees the year before, while Eternal reported net income of 5.27 billion rupees in FY25.\"If companies don't move to the path of profitability, there could be a bubble,\" Taurani said.",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "Businesswoman working on laptop in modern office spaceMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesStudent debt has long been considered difficult, if not impossible, to discharge in bankruptcy. But that hasn't been the case in recent years, a new study finds. The success rate for student loan borrowers who attempt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy has \"jumped\" to 87%, according to an analysis published in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal this month by Jason Iuliano, a professor at the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law. In 2017, the success rate for education debt holders in bankruptcy was 61%, and in 2007, it was 40%, Iuliano found. \"People who file for discharge are winning at very high rates,\" Iuliano told CNBC. His study used a final dataset of 652 bankruptcy discharge cases from October 2022 to November 2023 that included student loans.

What you can expectHere's the inflation breakdown for November 2025 — in one chartCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe improved outcomes for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy stem, in large part, from updated bankruptcy guidelines the Biden administration issued. In November 2022, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice rolled out a policy that experts say treats student loans more like other types of debt in bankruptcy court. Borrowers can fill out a 15-page attestation form, detailing their financial struggles and making their case for a mulligan. The Trump administration has not rescinded that guidance. The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, government data shows.Easier process is 'life-changing' for someAmid concerns that young people would try to avoid their financial obligations, policymakers began passing laws in the mid-1970s that raised the bar for discharging student debt in court. Government attorneys battled the cases, and some people needed to prove a \"certainty of hopelessness\" and \"undue hardship.\" Malissa Giles, a bankruptcy attorney in Virginia, said the easier bankruptcy process has been \"life-changing\" for her clients, many of whom have carried their student debt for decades. \"It allows them to sleep at night,\" she said. Women made up 73% of the student loan bankruptcy filers in the cases Iuliano reviewed. The average student loan balance for the filers was $115,000, but 10% of the borrowers owed more than $240,000. The debtors ranged in age from 24 to 76. Student debt not dischargeable is a 'myth' While the odds for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy have slowly improved, many people still don't bother to file the separate lawsuit required for the discharge of student debt, called an adversary proceeding, Iuliano found. More than 3 million student loan borrowers filed for bankruptcy between 2011 and 2024. But only 7,293 of those individuals took the additional step of requesting a student loan discharge, he writes in his study. \"The myth that student loans are never dischargeable in bankruptcy is so pervasive that many attorneys never even raise the possibility with their clients,\" Iuliano told CNBC.  \"However, the new attestation process is so streamlined that bankruptcy attorneys should be recommending it to every client with student loans,\" he said. Bankruptcy can be 'the only real path out' The easier bankruptcy process may offer a lifeline to many Americans struggling with education debt. Student loan holders have been under pressure from a weakening labor market, a barrage of changes to the lending system and recent trouble accessing relief programs, including debt forgiveness and affordable repayment plans. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the Education Department recently confirmed to CNBC. \"For many people, interest and fees have turned the balance into something they can never repay, so bankruptcy is the only real path out,\" Iuliano said.

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is on pace to be the top U.S.-traded automaker stock of 2025, as shares of GM are having their best year since the Detroit company's reemergence from bankruptcy in 2009.GM stock is up over 55% to a record of more than $80 per share, as of Friday's close, topping the company's previous annual increase of 48.3% last year. That includes a nearly 13% rise so far in December, adding to five consecutive months of share gains, according to FactSet.Several factors have been driving the share increase. But GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives have contended for years that the automaker's stock has been significantly undervalued given its consistent earnings performance.\"Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,\" Barra said during the company's last quarterly earnings call in October.Amid the stock's run-up, Barra has significantly cut her position in the company. She has exercised options or sold roughly 1.8 million shares this year, valued at more than $73 million, according to public filings confirmed by GM. As of the last public filing in September, Barra still owned more than 433,500 shares valued at over $35 million, with much of her annual awards granted in options and stock.GM's stock performance compares with a 17% yearly increase for Tesla as of Friday's close, a 34% jump for Ford Motor and a 15% loss for Chrysler parent Stellantis. Other U.S.-traded automakers such as Honda Motor and Toyota Motor have had smaller annual gains.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto stocksGM 's most recent quarterly earnings were a major catalyst for Wall Street analyst bullishness that led to reratings and price target increases after the third quarter.The automaker's quarterly adjusted earnings per share have topped Wall Street estimates every quarter except the second quarter of 2022 over the past five years, according to average expectations of analysts compiled by FactSet. Wall Street analysts overall have cited GM's cash generation, earnings resilience and track record in delivering shareholder returns, including stock buybacks, as reasons for their optimism. The automaker also is expected to greatly benefit from regulation changes under the Trump administration, despite ongoing tariffs. UBS recently increased its 12-month price target on GM stock by 14% to $97 per share, while naming the company its top autos pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley earlier this month also upgraded GM to overweight, with a $90 per share price target.\"In our view, General Motors leads the D3 in the North America and Global market with steady unit sales growth, [average transaction price] growth, disciplined incentive spend, and inventory management. This has resulted in better [earnings before interest and taxes] margin and return metrics than peers,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said in a Dec. 7 investor note.Read moreGM stock has cumulatively been in the black on a weekly basis since June. The largest weekly gain of 19.3% occurred when the automaker reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. Those results beat Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its annual guidance, adding that next year's earnings are expected to be better than 2025's.GM stock's has also seen a boost from some external factors. The Trump administration has loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions standards, removed related penalties that were imposed under the Biden administration, and renegotiated its trade deal with South Korea, a major manufacturing hub for GM. Meanwhile, the industry has been seeing a slowdown in less profitable EV sales.\"GM is effectively a regional (NA) [automaker] and we believe they are well positioned to benefit from the relaxed US regulatory environment (emissions and fuel economy),\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Dec. 15 investor note raising the per share price.GM CFO Paul Jacobson earlier this month said the company will continue stock buybacks.\"As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares. And I think you'll continue to see that from us going forward,\" he said during a UBS investor conference.GM is rated overweight with an $80.86 target price, according to analyst averages compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Correction: Lucid shares are down for the year.

    "body": "With 2026 around the corner, many people are eyeing tips and tricks to bring into the new year at home and at work.And while many are considering a new morning or evening routine, there are two other routines you might want to incorporate into your schedule, specifically at work, to better focus when you need to and disconnect at the end of the day, says Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and author of several books on focus and productivity.Newport is a proponent of using time blocking to reserve time during your day for deep work, meaning the tasks that are most cognitively demanding.The first routine Newport recommends is for the run-up to a deep work block.\"Our brain is not wired for sustained concentration on an abstract or symbolic topic,\" Newport says. \"Give your brain time, give it some help shifting over into deep work mode because it's a very unnatural thing you're asking your brain to do.\"Many workers are constantly bombarded with notifications throughout their day. A Microsoft report from April found that employees are interrupted every 2 minutes by emails, meetings or pings. The brain is in a very different state managing all of that digital noise than when you're zeroed in on deep work, so it takes to switch between these modes.Before a deep work block on your calendar, you might take a quick walk around the block, make tea, or clean your desk — something you can repeat and use as a signal to your brain it's time to switch modes. Think of it like stretching before you go on a run.\"You can't just shut down your inbox, open Microsoft Word and think, 'Now I'm focused,'\" Newport says.At the end of your workday, you also need a shutdown routine.\"It's a way of clearing out your brain after work so it's not going to be held partially hostage by work thoughts for your time outside of work,\" Newport says.His shutdown routine as he signs off at the end of his workday includes doing a final inbox check, looking ahead on his work calendar and writing down any reminders.At the end of it, you should feel, \"We're in a good place, there's nothing else I need to figure out tonight, we're on track for the things we need to get done.\" Then, you should have \"some sort of visible shutdown statement or routine to indicate you've finished.\" Newport, for example, checks off a box that says \"Shutdown complete\" as the last step.A shutdown routine won't magically put an end to your work anxiety, but it can \"help teach your brain to slow down work ruminations.\"\"Instead of engaging with the ruminations, you say I checked that checkbox and I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't gone through everything and convinced myself we're in a good position to shut down for the day,\" Newport says.\"It prevents you from the temptation of maybe I should just go check my inbox,\" he adds. \"It helps you move on from work in a way that eventually your brain learns so you can get more out of your life outside work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "QTS's data center in Cambois, North East of EnglandWhen the U.K. announced its AI Opportunities Action Plan — a grand blueprint to deploy the tech across society — in January, Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared the strategy would make the country an \"AI superpower.\" One of the key pillars of this plan was a rapid buildout of data centres capable of providing the huge compute requirements for the rollout of AI. This would be driven by \"AI growth zones\" — designated areas with relaxed planning permission and improved access to power. Nearly one year on, and Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google have all committed billions of dollars to AI infrastructure in the country. Four AI growth zones have been unveiled, and homegrown startups like Nscale have emerged as key players in the space. But critics point to heavily restricted access to energy via the national grid and slow-moving buildouts as signs the country is at risk of lagging further behind global rivals in the AI race. \"Ambition and delivery are not yet aligned,\" Ben Pritchard, CEO of data center power supplier AVK, told CNBC. \"Growth has been held back largely by constraints around power availability. Grid bottlenecks, in particular, have slowed the pace of development and mean the U.K. is not yet deploying infrastructure quickly enough to keep pace with global competitors.\"Grid connection delaysIt is still early days in the U.K.'s AI infrastructure buildout as AI growth zones are currently in their initial phases of development.A site in Oxfordshire, the first to be announced in February, has yet to begin building work and is still considering delivery partner proposals. Ground preparation work has begun at one in the North East of England, announced in September, with formal building beginning early 2026.Two more sites, in North and South Wales were unveiled in November. The former is searching for an investment partner, which the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSIT) told CNBC it expects to be confirmed in the coming months. The latter is made up of a cluster of sites, some of which are already operational with additional construction work to be done on others, DSIT said. watch nowThe U.K. government said in July it was targeting a core group of AI growth zones serving at least 500 megawatts of demand by 2030, with at least one scaling to more than one gigawatt by that time.But the most serious challenge to realising those ambitions is the U.K.'s limited grid capacity, said Pritchard.\"Developers expect grid connection delays of eight to ten years, and the volume of outstanding connection requests, especially around London, is unprecedented,\" he told CNBC. AI workloads are also \"dramatically increasing energy demand\" as businesses and consumers begin to use the tech, putting additional pressure on a stretched energy system, Pritchard added. \"They are no longer isolated risks; they are actively slowing down or blocking developments across the country.\"The open call for applications for the AI growth zone initiative created a situation where landowners with pylons or powercables running across their land applied for the designation, said Kao Data's Spencer Lamb.\"This resulted in the national grid being inundated with power grid applications from speculative sources,\" with no realistic chance of success, he told CNBC.Laying the groundworkThe National Energy System Operator (Neso) — The U.K.'s public body responsible for managing the national grid — has made moves to fix the situation. Earlier this month it announced plans to prioritise hundreds of projects for faster access to the grid. Neso declined to comment on whether AI infrastructure projects were among those prioritised when asked by CNBC, but did say a significant portion were data centers.There have also been big money commitments from tech giants, many of which were paraded by the U.K. government in September.Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, CoreWeave and others announced billions of dollars of AI investment during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, which involved plans to deploy the latest chips in the country and open new data centers. Homegrown startup Nscale, which provides access to AI compute and is building data centers, also announced deals to deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia chips at an AI factory just outside London by early 2027.Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip is displayed at the company's GTC conference in San Jose, California, on March 19, 2025.Max A. Cherney | Reuters\"Investment from major private players has laid important groundwork,\" Puneet Gupta, general manager for the U.K. and Ireland at data infrastructure company NetApp, told CNBC. \"Momentum is also building around national research supercomputers and plans for new compute capacity, with commitments to build AI 'gigafactories' in the UK.\"But the \"real test\" will be how quickly those plans translate into usable compute for U.K. organisations, said Gupta.Avoiding an AI infrastructure 'sugar rush'The long-term success of the country's AI infrastructure buildout will require it to invest in the \"full stack,\" including data pipelines, storage, energy sourcing, security, talent and skills, Stuart Abbott, U.K. and Ireland's managing director at AI infrastructure company VAST Data, told CNBC. \"If the UK wants this to be durable rather than a one-year sugar rush, it has to treat AI infrastructure like economic infrastructure.\"Stuart AbbottU.K. and Ireland's managing director at AI infrastructure company VAST DataThat means \"developing an operational fabric that lets real institutions deploy AI safely at scale,\" he added. \"If the UK wants this to be durable rather than a one-year sugar rush, it has to treat AI infrastructure like economic infrastructure.\"The challenges are significant. The value of data center deals in Europe pales in comparison to sums funneled into projects in the U.S. The U.K. also currently has the costliest energy in Europe, which is around 75% higher than before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and legacy grid infrastructure which can take many years to connect to new sites.One potential solution for projects that are unable to secure access to the national grid are microgrids, AVK's Pritchard said. Microgrids are self-contained power networks from sources like engines, renewables and batteries. AVK is currently designing two microgrids for partners building cloud compute, though not for AI, in the U.K. They can take around three years to build and cost around 10% more than energy from the grid at the moment, according to Pritchard. Co-locating compute where power already exists, rather than \"forcing everything to be greenfield\" — the term for undeveloped sites — is also a way to get AI infrastructure up and running faster, VAST Data's Abbot said.The pace of implementation will be critical, Kao Data's Lamb told CNBC. \"Unless fundamental issues around energy availability and pricing, AI copyright and funding for AI developments are solved quickly, the U.K. will miss out on one of the most remarkable economic opportunities of our time and ultimately risks becoming an international AI backwater.\"",

Zelenskyy said \"Russia clearly does not want a ceasefire for now\" after several days of heavy drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine's comments come after talks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Sunday. Trump said the discussions had gone well but acknowledged that \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy described the talks as a \"really great discussion\" in which security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, but Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.watch nowWhen asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede the eastern Donbas region to Russia and has rejected security guarantees for Kyiv so far. For its part, Ukraine has repeatedly rejected calls for the Donbas, which is mostly but not fully occupied by Russian forces, to be handed to Moscow. It's unclear whether Zelenskyy would meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a peace agreement was agreed in principle, with both leaders vehemently refusing to meet in the past.Trump said he had spoken with Putin about peace proposals during a phone conversation on Sunday but signalled that Russia had not appeared to support a ceasefire to allow for a referendum in Ukraine. He divulged few other details about the call, which he said lasted two hours. When asked to comment on the U.S.-Ukraine talks which followed that call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday: \"We don't know how they went. We can't judge. After these talks, the two presidents — I mean the President of Russia and the President of the United States — agreed to have a phone call again.

    "body": "Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center spaJames Cheung, partner at Mamou-ManiArtificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed, forcing a rethink of how the power-hungry servers behind the boom can coexist with — and draw less from — the environment.Data centers form the backbone of the internet, underpinnning nearly every digital service. But the facilities require huge amounts of energy and water, and are often considered an eyesore and a burden on the communities that house them. As more AI workloads are scaled into the facilities, the pressure on power supply chains will intensify.There's going to be a \"tipping point,\" where the architecture of data centers will no longer be fit for purpose, Simone Larsson, head of enterprise AI at Lenovo, told CNBC.In the face of a looming digital infrastructure crisis, tech giants and developers of the expensive infrastructure are exploring sustainable and out-of-the-box solutions.Data spas and villagesTraditional data centers are failing to efficiently power AI workloads and falling short of sustainability targets and compliance demands, according to the \"Data Center of the Future\" November study carried out by Lenovo in partnership with Opinium. The study found that the majority of IT decision makers prioritize technology partners who reduce energy, but only 46% of those surveyed said their current data center designs supported sustainability goals. In the face of those challenges, Lenovo has worked with architects from Mamou-Mani and engineers from AKT II to design data centers that can integrate better with the environment and address energy limitations. The outcome: designs that see data centers sequestered underground by utilizing disused tunnels or bunkers, or suspended in the air to make use of 24/7 energy from solar power.Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center bunker that utilizes disused tunnels or transport systems.James Cheung, Mamou-ManiIn so-called data villages, servers are stacked in a modular format near urban areas, allowing excess heat from the data centers to be transferred to power local amenities like schools or homes. The same goes for data center spas, which would see excess heat from data centers used in a wellbeing setting. The heat generated by the spa could in turn be repurposed to power cooling technology for the data center.But there's a catch: even Lenovo admits its designs will likely not be feasible until 2055 or later. The company said its study was designed to spark discussion and acknowledged that significant regulatory changes would be required before any such designs could be deployed. The cost and engineering complexity of some of the concepts, as well as legal and scalability constraints, also present challenges.Adoption would also vary widely by region. The U.S., for example, is more likely to adopt large-scale, ultra-high-density campuses due to high demand, more available land, and a relatively flexible regulatory environment, said Perkins Liu, senior research analyst at S&P Global's 451 Research. Meanwhile, Europe has a more constrained grid and stricter regulations, he said.That's not to say that novel data center designs are an entirely new concept. In 2018, Microsoft deployed a submarine-like data center 117 feet below sea level to take advantage of the cooling benefits of seawater and tidal power to enable the project to be powered fully by renewable energy.There are also many examples of operators redistributing heat from the facilities to warm nearby residences. Last summer, excess heat from an Equinix data center was used to heat the Olympic swimming pools in Paris.Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center spaServers in spaceFrom Google's \"moonshot\" Suncatcher project, Alibaba and Zhejiang Lab's \"Three-Body Computing Constellation\" initiative, to Nvidia's Starcloud — the orbital data center race is heating up. Smaller players including Edge Aerospace and Loft Orbital are also exploring the tech.It might seem like the stuff of science fiction — and indeed, Google cites a short story from science fiction writer Isaac Asimov as inspiration for its idea to tap directly into the sun as a source of energy – but these proposals are being explored more concretely by tech giants.The EU-funded ASCEND study, in partnership with Thales Alenia Space, explored the feasibility of launching centers into orbit using robotic technologies.Thales Alenia Space is now developing the technology required for this process with the goal of conducting a first in-orbit demonstration mission in 2028. In November, Starcloud, the startup backed by Nvidia, sent a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before.Around 70 million euros ($82 million) of private capital has been invested in space-based data center projects since 2020, according to a report from the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI). However, in the near term, orbital data centers remain out of reach as the cost of sending such equipment into space remains a significant barrier.\"Radiation-hardened hardware, cooling in the vacuum of space, and the extremely high cost of launching large, power-dense compute systems into orbit are major hurdles,\" said S&P Global's Liu. Challenges also include reliable high-speed communication, space debris, and the difficulties of maintenance, he said.ESPI's cost model for data centers depends on the success of Starship's launch price being as low as $10 million.\"If you asked me now, this is unrealistic in the near-term,\" said Jermaine Gutierrez, research fellow at ESPI. \"In the long run, however, the question is whether terrestrial developments and continued cost savings thereof, outpace the cost savings from deployment in space.\"'Faceless mega-juggernauts' Lenovo's Larsson said that its futuristic data center plans have co-existence and \"symbiosis\" at their core. This includes leveraging some of the heat from the data centers for use in the community and by other involved stakeholders.James Cheung, partner at Mamou-Mani, told CNBC that another goal was to make the facilities more visually appealing so that they aren't viewed as \"faceless mega-juggernauts of boxes.\" The Data Village involves a modular, stackable brick or pod system of data centers linked to city needs. Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagined the data centers of the future.James Cheung, partner at Mamou-ManiHe explained how the architects used techniques like biomimicry to explore how natural algorithms can show the most efficient ways to disperse heat.\"We interact with [data centers] every day, with our computers and with our phones. But this gentle giant, in the background, is putting massive pressure on water and our resources,\" he said.Future proofingIn order for many of these innovations to take place, experts told CNBC that regulation will need to be amended and new policies implemented to address the growing energy demands of AI and data centers.\"Data center operators could adopt green technologies at their wish, but it will have to be justified financially,\" said S&P Global's Liu. He added that the grid will need to be upgraded and renewable energy needs to be built out quickly for this to happen.watch nowSimply retrofitting data centers won't always work, said Lenovo's Larsson, as it leaves operators \"trying to enter into a cycle that's been broken to begin with.\"Instead, companies will need to think outside of the box and try to \"figure out what regulatory constraints would need to be flexed in order to not only serve the people on the planet but also the profits [of companies],\" she said.",

The public comment period ends Jan. 25.Beijing's planned rules would mark the world's first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. The latest proposals come as Chinese companies have rapidly developed AI companions and digital celebrities.Compared with China's generative AI regulation in 2023, Ma said that this version \"highlights a leap from content safety to emotional safety.\"The draft rules propose that: AI chatbots cannot generate content that encourages suicide or self-harm, or engage in verbal violence or emotional manipulation that damages users' mental health.If a user specifically proposes suicide, the tech providers must have a human take over the conversation and immediately contact the user's guardian or a designated individual.The AI chatbots must not generate gambling-related, obscene or violent content.Minors must have guardian consent to use AI for emotional companionship, with time limits on usage.Platforms should be able to determine whether a user is a minor even if the user does not disclose their age, and, in cases of doubt, apply settings for minors, while allowing for appeals.watch nowAdditional provisions would require tech providers to remind users after two hours of continuous AI interaction and mandate security assessments for AI chatbots with more than 1 million registered users or over 100,000 monthly active users.The document also encouraged the use of human-like AI in \"cultural dissemination and elderly companionship.\"Chinese AI chatbot IPOsThe proposal comes shortly after two leading Chinese AI chatbot startups, Z.ai and Minimax, filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong this month.Minimax is best known internationally for its Talkie AI app, which allows users to chat with virtual characters. The app and its domestic Chinese version, Xingye, accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue in the first three quarters of the year, with an average of over 20 million monthly active users during that time.Z.ai, also known as Zhipu, filed under the name \"Knowledge Atlas Technology.\" While the company did not disclose monthly active users, it noted its technology \"empowered\" around 80 million devices, including smartphones, personal computers and smart vehicles.Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comments on how the proposed rules could affect their IPO plans.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945.

It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "It's been a tough job market for young professionals, but there's some good news for 2026: New grads with up to four years' work experience are expected to see stronger wage growth next year, according to Glassdoor research.In other words, early-career workers who can secure a job are likely to have more spending power, at a rate surpassing 2020 levels — the last time wage growth kept pace with inflation.Wage growth will vary depending on the location. While rising cities may not offer the biggest paychecks compared to places like New York or San Francisco, they're seeing the fastest wage growth and offer a lower cost of living, Glassdoor researchers note.These are the top 10 cities for early-career wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor research:1. Provo, UtahAnnual growth since 2020: 7.0%Average salary in 2025: $61,164Job groups with fastest wage growth: Research and science; product and project management; human resources2. Boise, IdahoAnnual growth since 2020: 5.5%Average salary in 2025: $60,876Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; skilled labor and manufacturing; business3. Orlando, FloridaAnnual growth since 2020: 5.4%Average salary in 2025: $55,782Job groups with fastest wage growth: Skilled labor and manufacturing; research and science; customer services and support4. Charleston, South CarolinaAnnual growth since 2020: 5.3%Average salary in 2025: $59,100Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; sales; skilled labor and manufacturing5. Austin, TexasAnnual growth since 2020: 5.2%Average salary in 2025: $71,808Job groups with fastest wage growth: Customer services and support; legal; research and science6. Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FloridaAnnual growth since 2020: 5.2%Average salary in 2025: $62,970Job groups with fastest wage growth: Customer services and support; consulting; marketing7. Rochester, New YorkAnnual growth since 2020: 5.2%Average salary in 2025: $58,513Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care, engineering, sales8.

Richmond, VirginiaAnnual growth since 2020: 5.1%Average salary in 2025: $63,071Job groups with fastest wage growth: Finance and accounting; sales; product and project management10. Tucson, ArizonaAnnual growth since 2020: 5.1%Average salary in 2025: $59,975Job groups with fastest wage growth: Engineering; health care; retail and food servicesHealth-care jobs are the most in-demand roles with rising pay for young workers, Glassdoor lead researcher Chris Martin told CNBC Make It via email. These positions led wage growth in three of the top 10 cities: Boise, Charleston and Rochester.GlassdoorOverall, health care along with private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time. They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025, according to an Indeed analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Meanwhile, customer services and support roles led wage growth in Miami and Austin, per Glassdoor.And in many cities, wages are rising for jobs across the income spectrum, according to Glassdoor data. For example, Tucson's fastest-growing salaries for young workers were for engineering roles that pay an average salary of $86,700 in 2025, followed by health care ($64,100) and then retail and food services jobs ($35,800).Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore has claimed the top position in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) for the first time, bolstered by its robust education systems, sound governance and a proactive approach to sustaining an adaptive, innovation-ready workforce in the age of artificial intelligence.In its 11th edition this year, the index — produced by business school INSEAD and in partnership with D.C.-based think tank Portulans Institute — measured how countries grow, attract and retain talent across all income groups.This year's report, themed \"resilience in the age of disruption,\" ranked 135 economies globally on 77 indicators such as soft skills and AI talent concentration across six pillars.This report comes at a time when \"rapid technological change, geopolitical uncertainty and profound societal transitions make dependable talent metrics more essential than ever,\" said Rafael Escalona Reynoso, CEO of Portulans Institute.While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety.Lily FangDean of research and innovation, INSEAD\"While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety,\" said INSEAD's dean of research and innovation, Lily Fang. \"Geopolitical uncertainty poses massive challenges to the resilience of global commerce and markets, while artificial intelligence presents both amazing opportunities to enhance human potential — but also unfathomable risks.\"Here are the top 10 countries in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index: SingaporeSwitzerlandDenmarkFinlandSwedenNetherlandsNorwayLuxembourgUnited StatesAustralia Notably, Switzerland was leapfrogged by Singapore and fell from its top position for the first time in the history of the GTCI. However, the country records multiple top-five results across the study's framework, including internet access in schools (1st), government effectiveness (2nd), and AI skills migration (4th).High-income European countries continue to dominate the ranking, accounting for seven of the top ten positions. Switzerland, Denmark and Finland closely follow each other in the top ten, \"suggesting a shared focus on enabling and retaining talent through favorable conditions and access to opportunities,\" according to the report. These three countries consistently rank near the top in enabling and retaining talent.Several Nordic countries have jumped places in the top ten since the last GTCI in 2023. Denmark moved up one position to 3rd this year from 4th in the 2023 report, Finland jumped two places from 6th to 4th, and Sweden jumped four places from 9th in rank in 2023 to 4th this year. Meanwhile, the United States fell from third place in 2023 to ninth in this year's report — its weakest showing since 2013. Although the U.S. scored strongly in areas such as enabling and growing talent, \"slight declines in the categories of openness and lifelong learning\" pushed the country down to ninth place in 2025, according to the report.Singapore takes the leadSingapore's rise marks a big milestone for both the country and the wider region in the competition for talent, the report said.The city-state \"ranks in the top ten across four of the six pillars and has made notable improvements in its ability to retain talent, rising seven positions,\" according to the report. The Southeast Asian country also leads globally in enabling and retaining talent, which is supported by the country's regulatory landscape and high standards of living. The country also ranked first globally in formal education and \"Generalist Adaptive Skills,\" which spans soft skills, digital literacy, and innovation-oriented thinking.A key driver of Singapore's jump this year is a sharp improvement in its ability to retain talent, jumping seven places from 38th in 2023 to 31st this year. The report pointed to gains in areas such as physician density, personal rights, personal safety and more. \"Economies that cultivate adaptable, cross-functional and AI-literate workforces tend to be better positioned to convert disruption into opportunity and sustain long-term competitiveness,\" says Paul Evans, emeritus professor of organisational behaviour at INSEAD and co-editor of the report.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. \"There's some trickery happening,\" says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. \"Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago.\"That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. \"The consumer has to be proactive,\" says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. \"Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale.\" Track price historiesIdeally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, \"it's definitely not too late\" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. \"Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark,\" says Woroch. Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. \"Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price,\" Woroch says. \"Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need.\"Beware of other Black Friday pitfallsAlthough Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. \"You may be able to find good deals on mattresses,\" says Lupo. \"But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday.\"And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls \"spaving\" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive \"bundle\" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. \"Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free,\" Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, \"you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "watch nowMassachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday released a study that found that artificial intelligence can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, or as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, health care and professional services.The study was conducted using a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which was created by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The index simulates how 151 million U.S. workers interact across the country and how they are affected by AI and corresponding policy. The Iceberg Index, which was announced earlier this year, offers a forward-looking view of how AI may reshape the labor market, not just in coastal tech hubs but across every state in the country. For lawmakers preparing billion-dollar reskilling and training investments, the index offers a detailed map of where disruption is forming down to the zip code.\"Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market,\" said Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research. ORNL is a Department of Energy research center in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modeling efforts.The index runs population-level experiments, revealing how AI reshapes tasks, skills and labor flows long before those changes show up in the real economy, Balaprakash said. The index treats the 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.What the researchers found is that the visible tip of the iceberg — the layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing and information technology — represents just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Beneath the surface lies the total exposure, the $1.2 trillion in wages, and that includes routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration. Those are areas sometimes overlooked in automation forecasts.The index is not a prediction engine about exactly when or where jobs will be lost, the researchers said. Instead, it's meant to give a skills-centered snapshot of what today's AI systems can already do, and give policymakers a structured way to explore what-if scenarios before they commit real money and legislation.The researchers partnered with state governments to run proactive simulations. Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah helped validate the model using their own labor data and have begun building policy scenarios using the platform.watch nowTennessee moved first, citing the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month. Utah state leaders are preparing to release a similar report based on Iceberg's modeling. North Carolina state Sen. DeAndrea Salvador, who has worked closely with MIT on the project, said what drew her to the research is how it surfaces effects that traditional tools miss. She added that one of the most useful features is the ability to drill down to local detail. \"One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,\" she said. Salvador said that kind of simulation work is especially valuable as states stand up overlapping AI task forces and working groups.The Iceberg Index also challenges a common assumption about AI risk — that it will stay confined to tech roles in coastal hubs. The index's simulations show exposed occupations spread across all 50 states, including inland and rural regions that are often left out of the AI conversation.To address that gap, the Iceberg team has built an interactive simulation environment that allows states to experiment with different policy levers — from shifting workforce dollars and tweaking training programs to exploring how changes in technology adoption might affect local employment and gross domestic product. \"Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,\" the report says. Balaprakash, who also serves on the Tennessee Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council, shared state-specific findings with the governor's team and the state's AI director. He said many of Tennessee's core sectors — health care, nuclear energy, manufacturing and transportation — still depend heavily on physical work, which offers some insulation from purely digital automation. The question, he said, is how to use new technologies such as robotics and AI assistants to strengthen those industries rather than hollow them out.For now, the team is positioning Iceberg not as a finished product but as a sandbox that states can use to prepare for AI's impact on their workforces. \"It is really aimed towards getting in and starting to try out different scenarios,\" Salvador said.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates have hovered around the same range for roughly two months, giving current borrowers nor potential homebuyers little incentive to get into the market. Total mortgage application volume was essentially flat last week, up just 0.2% from the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances $806,500 or less increased to 6.40% from 6.37%, with points decreasing to 0.60 from 0.62, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the highest since early October. Last year, during the same week, the average rate was 46 basis points higher. Despite the slight rate increase, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 8% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week a year ago. That was driven by buyers looking for cheaper loans. The government purchase index, which includes FHA, VA, and USDA applications, increased 9% for the week and had its strongest week since 2023.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Affordability remains a challenge in many markets and government loan programs remain appealing to qualified buyers looking to purchase a home. The average purchase loan size decreased to its lowest level in two months,\" said Joel Kan, MBA Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 6% for the week but were 117% higher than the same week one year ago. That enormous annual difference is not because of any refinance boom; it's simply that the numbers were so very low a year ago. Mortgage rates dropped back a bit to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily (MND). \"Rather than credit any of the recent underlying events, the improvement in rates/bonds has more to do with idiosyncratic trading conditions that are often seen on major holiday weeks,\" explained Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND. \"That said, some of [Tuesday's] data and events contributed. These include another weak reading in weekly employment numbers from ADP as well as a reaction to rumors that rate-friendly Kevin Hassett will be the next Fed Chair.\"",

    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesConsumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday.The board's Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2.In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points.\"Consumers were notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,\" said Dana Peterson, the board's chief economist. \"Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings.\"A key reading within the report that measures job expectations showed deterioration.The share of workers saying that jobs are \"plentiful\" slid to 6%, down from 28.6% in October and reflective of the \"no hire, no fire\" current job climate showing in other data points. Another question asking whether jobs were \"hard to get\" edged lower to 17.9%, a drop of 0.4 percentage point.Those results come the same day that payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies shed an average 13,500 jobs over the past four weeks. Moreover, the Conference Board survey is consistent with other measures showing weakening sentiment among consumers.For instance, the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped 4.9% in November on a monthly basis and was off 29% from a year ago.The weakening numbers have coincided with public statements from several key Federal Reserve officials who believe further interest rate reductions are warranted. Traders are pricing in a high probability that the Fed lowers its key borrowing rate by another quarter percentage point in December.In the Conference Board survey, Peterson noted weakness across income and political groups.\"Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,\" Peterson said. \"Mentions of the labor market eased somewhat but still stood out among all other frequent themes not already cited.\"Inflation expectations rose, with respondents predicting a 4.8% rate one year from now, well above the Fed's 2% target and topping the Michigan survey outlook for 4.5%. Respondents also expressed \"strongly positive\" expectations for the stock market over the next year.Economic data has been hampered by the recently ended shutdown. Government agencies responsible for the reports suspended all data collection and releases while the impasse continued, with a trickle of mostly dated reports coming out in recent days.",

Jim Justice holds up his dog Babydog as he comes to the end of his State of the State speech in the House chambers, at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston, W.Va., Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022.Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette | APThe U.S. government on Monday sued Sen. Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican, and his wife for more than $5 million in unpaid federal income taxes, penalties, and interest dating to the 2009 tax filing year.\"Despite notice and demand for payment of the assessments ...James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States,\" the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Beckley, West Virginia, alleged.The lawsuit, filed by the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, asked a judge to enter a judgment in favor of the U.S. against the couple in the amount of $5,164,739.75, the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service as of Aug. 4, according to the filing.Hours after the suit was docketed, a lawyer for the Justices and the DOJ filed a joint motion asking a judge to enter a consent judgment in favor of the U.S. for the amount requested.The motion indicates that the couple agreed to resolve their case by being ordered to pay the amount requested. But it does not say when they would or could pay that money.On Tuesday, Judge Frank Volk signed the consent judgment, which obligates the Justices to pay the requested amount.The suit was filed nearly two months after the IRS filed notices of tax liens for more than $8 million against Justice, who is the former governor of West Virginia, in Greenbrier County.Justice, who was a Democrat until 2019, has claimed that the liens were politically motivated.One of the notices referenced a federal income tax assessment of more than $3 million for the tax year 2009, which was assessed on Nov. 25, 2015 — the same date as the assessment referenced in the lawsuit filed Monday.The second federal income tax assessment, for nearly $5 million, was for the tax filing year 2017. A third such assessment, for the 2024 tax year, was for nearly $11,000./ Politico, which first broke the news of the tax lien on Oct. 10, noted then that the IRS website says \"generally the IRS can pursue collection of a tax liability up to 10 years from the date it was assessed. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be filed any time within that 10-year period.\"Tuesday is the end of a 10-year period that would have begun on Nov. 25, 2015.Justice was elected to the Senate in November 2024, replacing Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent who quit the Democratic caucus earlier that year.

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "Enrique Lores, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP Inc. speaks at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. Ann Wang | ReutersPC and printer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday it'll lower its headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 people, representing a cut of up to 10%. HP also issued a lower-than-expected earnings projection for the new fiscal year. Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.Here's how HP did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: 93 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expectedRevenue: $14.64 billion vs. $14.48 billion expectedHP's revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income of $795 million, or 84 cents per share, was up from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.For the first quarter of HP's fiscal 2026, the company called for 73 cents to 81 cents in adjusted net earnings per share, while the LSEG consensus was 79 cents. For all of fiscal 2026, HP sees $2.90 to $3.20 in adjusted per share, below the LSEG consensus of $3.33.\"HP's outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. trade-related regulations in place, and associated mitigations,\" the company said in the statement.The company's personal systems unit that includes desktop and laptop computers contributed $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above StreetAccount's $10.15 billion consensus.HP said it expects to complete the headcount reduction by the end of fiscal 2028. The company said the restructuring will result in savings of at least $1 billion in annualized gross run rate by the end of fiscal 2028. HP said it expects to incur about $650 million in charges, of which $250 million will happen in fiscal 2026.\"As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said on a conference call with analysts. Corporate executives across industries are hoping to draw on generative artificial intelligence products to speed up software developers and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to a rise in the cost per gigabyte of RAM this year. HP, whose headcount stood at 58,000 as of December, announced a similarly sized round of layoffs in 2022. Several other technology companies have announced layoffs in recent months as U.S. consumers face higher prices and interest rates.\"Memory costs are currently 15 to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,\" Lores said.The company does expect to benefit after Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows 10 operating system in October, which will lead people to buy new machines, Lores said. Around 60% of HP's installed base has moved to Windows 11, he said.HP's printing business did $4.3 billion in revenue, down 4%. The pricing environment is competitive, and customers are putting off purchases of new models, said Karen Parkhill, the company's finance chief.As of Tuesday's close, HP shares were down 25% for the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 15% in the same period.WATCH: HP CEO: Tariffs are mostly nonmaterialwatch now",

    "body": "People shop at a clothing store in Manhattan on Nov. 7, 2025, in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Consulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on November 19, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesNvidia on Tuesday said its tech remains a generation ahead of the industry, in response to Wall Street's concerns that the company's dominance of AI infrastructure could be threatened by Google's AI chips.\"We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,\" Nvidia said in a post on X. \"NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\"The post came after Nvidia saw its shares fall 3% on Tuesday after a report that Meta, one of its key customers, could strike a deal with Google to use its tensor processing units for its data centers. In its post, Nvidia said its chips are more flexible and powerful compared with so-called ASIC chips — such as Google's TPUs — which are designed for a single company or function. Nvidia's latest generation of chips are known as Blackwell. \"NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,\" Nvidia said in its post. Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for artificial intelligence chips with its graphics processors, analysts say, but Google's in-house chips have gotten increased attention in recent weeks as a viable alternative to the Blackwell chips, which are expensive but powerful. Unlike Nvidia, Google doesn't sell its TPU chips to other companies, but it uses them for internal tasks and allows companies to rent them through Google Cloud. Earlier this month, Google released Gemini 3, a well-reviewed state-of-the-art AI model that was trained on the company's TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. \"We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed rising TPU competition on an earnings call earlier this month, noting that Google was a customer for his company's GPU chips and that Gemini can run on Nvidia's technology. He also mentioned that he was in touch with Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind. Huang said that Hassabis texted him to say that the tech industry theory that using more chips and data will create more powerful AI models — often called \"scaling laws\" by AI developers — is \"intact.\" Nvidia says that scaling laws will lead to even more demand for the company's chips and systems.

Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe data centers that power the artificial intelligence revolution are driving up electricity prices for households — and price relief may not be coming anytime soon, according to energy experts.Residential retail electricity prices in September were up 7.4%, to about 18 cents per kilowatt hour, according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration. Electricity prices closely tracked inflation from 2013 to 2023, but will likely outpace inflation at least through 2026, according to an EIA forecast from May. Some regions will be hit harder than others, it said. Energy experts and economists point to electricity-hungry data centers that underpin AI projects as a key reason for the price inflation. These data centers are vast warehouses of computer servers and other IT equipment that power cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other tech applications.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageAI data center 'frenzy' is pushing up your electric bill — here's why'Buyers may be a little disappointed' by Black Friday car deals: analystIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

What to watch forCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe basic reason for rising prices: Electricity demand — including actual and forecasted demand — is outstripping new supply. Data centers are expected to consume anywhere from 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy estimated in December 2024.John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed to the \"data center frenzy\" as the primary driver of higher electricity prices for households.\"They're pretty much the whole boat when it comes to increases in electricity demand,\" Quigley said. \"It's going to get worse,\" he said. Affordability is the 'most salient issue' in politicsVirginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger delivers remarks during her election-night rally at the Greater Richmond Convention Center on November 04, 2025 in Richmond, Virginia. Win Mcnamee | Getty ImagesTo be sure, data centers aren't the only contributor to higher electricity prices, experts said. But escalating electricity prices \"can strain household budgets ... undermine economic competitiveness ... and hinder the electrification of energy systems,\" researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory wrote in a recent analysis.Rising electricity prices for U.S. households also come as politicians continue to leverage the affordability theme to garner support. New Jersey governor-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, both Democrats, promised to lower electricity bills for state residents. During her campaign, Spanberger said she wants to \"make sure data centers don't drive up energy costs for everyone else in Virginia.\"watch nowWhile on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump had also pledged to cut electricity and energy prices in half within his first 18 months of office.\"Affordability remains [the] most salient issue in politics,\" Chris Krueger, a strategist at Washington Research Group, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.Rising energy bills are pushing households deeper into debt, according to a recent analysis by the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. The average overdue balance on utility bills has risen 32% since 2022, to $789 from $597, it found. Utilities include electricity and other costs like gas and water. Households that use electricity to heat their homes are estimated to see their winter heating bills rise to $1,205 this season, up about 10% from $1,093 last winter, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\"Consumers may again feel the pressure on their utility bills in the coming months, particularly if the winter is a cold one,\" according to a Bank of America Institute report from October.Booming electricity demandthe Google Midlothian Data Center in Midlothian, Texas, US, on Friday, Nov. 14, 2025. Jonathan Johnson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAI euphoria has been driving the U.S. stock market ever higher — and fueling speculation that the market is in a tech-fueled bubble that might soon pop.Regardless of whether the market's AI rally proves sustainable, the scale of the technology's growth is unmistakable. The International Energy Agency expects worldwide electricity demand from AI data centers to more than quadruple by 2030.\"Global electricity demand from data centres is set to more than double over the next five years, consuming as much electricity by 2030 as the whole of Japan does today,\" Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, said in that analysis. The effects will be \"particularly strong\" in countries like the U.S., where data centers are projected to account for almost half of the growth in overall electricity demand, according to the IEA analysis. The U.S. economy is on track to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, the IEA found.watch nowForecasted demand has fueled the need for new infrastructure like power lines, substations and power plants, the costs of which companies at least partly pass on to residential consumers, said Quigley of UPenn. In other words, households are partially subsidizing the AI data center expansion, he said. While AI-driven electricity demand is happening across the U.S., some electric grid managers are better at managing costs than others,\" said Quigley. \"The amount of the [price] increase will vary by region,\" he said. Amazon's largest AI data center has seven completed buildings, with 30 total buildings planned on 1,200 acres in New Carlisle, Indiana, shown here on October 8, 2025.Erin BlackFor example, extreme weather like hurricanes, storms and wildfires contributed to \"sizable\" price growth in some states like California, where wildfire risk mitigation and liability insurance were \"major cost drivers,\" according to an October report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a U.S. Energy Department laboratory managed by the University of California. After accounting for the impact of inflation, 31 states actually saw electricity prices decline from 2019 to 2024, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers. Seventeen states saw price increases after inflation, especially in states on the West Coast and in the Northeast, they found. Nationally, average retail electricity prices increased by 23% over that period in nominal terms, meaning before accounting for inflation, they found. Increasing residential electrification, including electric vehicles, is among other factors pushing up electricity demand, according to the Bank of America Institute. ",

Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters Wednesday that \"the content [of the U.S. plan] will be discussed,\" at the meeting, and claimed Russian officials had not discussed a U.S.-backed plan when talks were held with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. \"We, the Russian side, have not yet discussed any documents with anyone specifically ... We've agreed to a meeting with Mr. Witkoff. I hope he won't be alone. Other representatives of the U.S. team working on the Ukrainian dossier will be there,\" he said in comments translated by NBC News and reported by state news agency TASS. Ushakov said Russia had not yet officially received the U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine but had seen an unofficial version. Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" in comments reported by Reuters on Wednesday.Earlier today, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentatively Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.Reports from ABC News and CBS News both cited an unnamed U.S. official who said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while noting that some points still need to be ironed out. It was not clear if the same U.S. official was quoted in both stories.watch nowUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"Flurry of talksTrump's post came several days after U.S. officials met with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva last weekend for talks that resulted in significant revisions to Washington's initially proffered 28-point peace plan.That plan — which was widely seen as being highly favorable to Russia, the invading force — \"has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides,\" Trump acknowledged in Tuesday's post.\"Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,\" Ukraine National Security Secretary Rustem Umerov said in an X post.It's far from certain the Russia will assent to the revised peace plan, which has reportedly been narrowed to 19 points.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said any agreement must reflect the understandings reached by Trump and Putin during their August summit in Alaska.On Tuesday, officials from Kyiv and Moscow reportedly met with Driscoll in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.The Kremlin was tight-lipped about the discussions taking place there, with Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Tuesday that \"we still have nothing to say\" and that the Kremlin was \"monitoring media reports.\"Read more\"We understand that negotiations between the Americans and the Ukrainians are ongoing. We understand that some adjustments are being made to the text that was published; we understand that the text that we unofficially received earlier has already undergone changes, but at some point, the time will probably come when we will also establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information,\" Peskov said. \"For now, we have no new information.\"The initial, 28-point plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial terms, such as Ukraine making territorial concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region that is partially occupied by Russian forces.The original deal also demanded that Ukraine reduce its army by 50%, along with other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"Trump had pushed Ukraine to accept that deal by the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 27, prompting Zelenskyy to declare on Friday that Ukraine faced the difficult choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.That deadline appears to have been scrapped. It was unclear how many of the original deal's points remained in the latest version of a potential peace agreement.",

    "body": "Software company ServiceNow is in advanced talks to buy cybersecurity startup Armis, which was last valued at $6.1 billion, Bloomberg reported. The deal, which could reach $7 billion in value, would be ServiceNow's largest acquisition, the outlet said, citing people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The acquisition could be announced as soon as this week, but could still fall apart, according to the report. Armis and ServiceNow did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment.Armis, which helps companies secure and manage internet-connected devices and protect them against cyber threats, raised $435 million in a funding round just over a month ago and told CNBC about its eventual plans for an IPO.Armis CEO Yevgeny Dibrov and CTO Nadir Izrael.Courtesy: ArmisCEO and co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov said Armis was aiming for a public listing at the end of 2026 or early 2027, pending \"market conditions.\" Armis's decision to be acquired rather than wait for a public listing is a common path for startups at the moment. The IPO markets remain choppy and many startups are choosing to remain private for longer instead of risking a muted debut on the public markets. Founded in 2016, Armis said in August it had surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenues, a milestone it achieved less than a year after reaching $200 million in ARR.Its latest funding round was led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives' growth equity fund, with participation from CapitalG, a venture arm of Alphabet. Previous backers have included Sequoia Capital and Bain Capital Ventures.Read the complete Bloomberg article here.",

    "body": "19 November 2025, China, Shanghai: Boats sail past downtown Shanghai on the Huangpu River. The tallest building on the skyline is the Shanghai Tower (rear). Bernd von Jutrczenka | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesChina's economic slowdown deepened in November with consumption, investment and industrial output growth falling short of expectations, as authorities sought to curb supply while struggling to revive demand and arrest the property sector decline.  Retail sales rose 1.3% last month from a year earlier, sharply missing Reuters' median forecast for a 2.8% growth, and slowing from 2.9% rise in the prior month. Industrial production climbed 4.8% in November from a year ago, missing expectations for a 5% jump and marking its weakest growth since August 2024. Investment in fixed assets, which includes property, contracted 2.6% over the January through November period compared with a year earlier, sharper than the 2.3% drop estimated by economists. That decline deepened from the 1.7% in the January to October period, and was the sharpest slump seen since the pandemic outbreak in 2020, according to data from Wind Information going back to 1992. \"The contraction of fixed asset investment and the drop in property prices in recent months have been transmitted to the consumer sentiment,\" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint asset management, said in a note following the data, expecting more supportive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in the first quarter next year.   Investment in real estate dropped 15.9% in the first 11 months this year, steeper than the 10.3% drop seen in the January to October period, as the property slump drags on. In another sign that the sector downturn is still searching for a bottom, the declines in home prices across 70 major cities steepened in November. New home prices fell 1.2% in tier-1 cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen while resale home prices dropped 5.8% from a year earlier.  Meanwhile, economists at Golman Sachs in a preview last week pointed to the falling auto sales as a major drag on overall retail sales, coupled with the \"negative distortion\" effect from the earlier-than-usual start of the Singles-Day online shopping festival that pulled forward demand from November to October.  Data from China Automobile Dealers Association showed auto retail sales by volume in November declined for the first time in three years, dropping 8.1% from a year earlier to 2.23 million cars, as many local governments paused the trade-in subsidies.  Several online shopping sites extended their promotional period in a bid to jolt consumer spending, running from the first half of October through to Nov. 11, making it the longest Singles' Day sales period ever. But still, sales performance disappointed as consumers tightened their purse strings, with gross merchandise volume growing just 12%, compared to 20% growth last year, according to data from Syntun.  Call for rebalancingChinese policymakers have pledged further policy support to drive domestic demand and boost consumption and investment for next year. The finance ministry said in a statement Saturday that it planned to issue ultra-long-term special government bonds next year to fund projects bolstering national security. The proceeds will also be directed toward equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs. The ministry also pledged to boost its budget for investment to ease the slump in fixed-asset investment in recent months. However analysts appeared to be less optimistic as Beijing has yet to put any meaningful stimulus measures on the table.  \"Even though we're seeing targeted policy support in place, it is hard to generate a meaningful pickup in consumption without clearer improvement in job prospects and wage growth,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at asset management firm eToro. Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University and senior fellow at Brookings Institute, expressed concerns over the sustainability of China's economic growth. In an opinion piece published on Sunday, the economist urged structural reforms to rebalance the economy, including measures to support labour market, strengthen social safety net and bolster private enterprises.   \"The government clearly wants to rebalance growth and understands what's needed to bolster household consumption and raise productivity. Yet there is little sense of urgency and no clear timeline on concrete policy measures to accomplish these objectives,\" Prasad noted.  The urban unemployment rate in November came in at 5.1%, unchanged from the prior month. Youth unemployment has been more concerning, with the latest reading for October standing at 17.3%.    Still, China's economy appears to be on track to meet the official growth target of \"around 5%,\" thanks to a surge in exports to non-U.S. markets even as tariff tensions with Washington have weighed on shipments to the world's largest consumer market.China's trade surplus surged to a record $1.1 trillion in November, breaking its full-year record of $992.2 billion in 2024, in just 11 months, drawing widespread concerns over its reliance on foreign demand and depreciation of its currency to keep exports competitive. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva last week called on China to \"accelerate\" support for domestic consumption and shift away from relying on exports for growth. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, cautioned that appreciating renminbi, or yuan, to reduce trade surplus was unlikely to be sustainable without meaningful steps to end deflation in the economy.The trade-weighted renminbi's value against a basket of currencies, rather than solely against the U.S. dollar, has appreciated by 3% from 2021 to 2025, a period when China's exports surged by 44.8%, according to Lu's estimates. \"If there is a slowdown in growth and worsening deflation, markets may again take a bearish view on RMB, leading to depreciation against USD and its basket,\" Lu noted.The offshore yuan has strengthened over 3% this year to 7.0496 per dollar on Monday, its strongest level since October last year, according to LSEG data.       \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at  an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, Japan, on February 03, 2025. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesOn Dec. 11, 2015, OpenAI launched as a nonprofit research lab after Elon Musk and a group of prominent techies, including Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, pledged $1 billion to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The idea was for the project to be be free of commercial pressures and the pursuit of money. A decade later, that founding mission is all but forgotten. Musk, now the world's richest person, is long gone, having created rival startup xAI. And he's been engaged in a heated legal and public relations fight with OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. Far from the nonprofit realm, OpenAI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet, zooming to a $500 billion private market valuation, with almost all of that value accruing since the company's launch of ChatGPT three years ago. More than 800 million people now use the chatbot every week. Musk's xAI, meanwhile, is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation this month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber in late November.OpenAI and xAI are two of the main companies, along with Google, Anthropic and Meta, pouring money into AI models, as the market rapidly evolves from text-based chatbots to AI-generated videos and more advanced compute-intensive forms of content, as well as into agentic AI, with large enterprises customizing tools to enhance productivity. For OpenAI, the price tag is almost incomprehensible: $1.4 trillion and growing. That's primarily for the mammoth data centers and high-powered chips required to meet what the company sees as insatiable demand for its technology. For now, OpenAI is a cash-burning machine going up against tech's megacaps and their chip suppliers, drawing comparisons to earlier waves of high-growth tech firms that spent heavily for years to challenge behemoth incumbents, but to mixed results.\"OpenAI has a very big role in the in the history of the development of artificial intelligence, and will forever have that role,\" said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview. \"Now, will that role be Netscape, or will it be Google? We've yet to find out.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at an event ahead of the COMPUTEX forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2024.Ann Wang | ReutersIt's a position that would've been hard to imagine in 2016, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hauled a black DGX-1 supercomputer up to OpenAI's offices in San Francisco's Mission District. The $300,000 machine had cost Nvidia \"a few billion dollars\" to develop, and there were no other buyers, Huang recalled recently on Joe Rogan's podcast.  Musk, at OpenAI, was the only one who wanted it.When Musk told him it was for \"a nonprofit company,\" Huang said all the blood drained from his face at the thought of parking such a costly box inside an organization that wasn't meant to make money.Behind the scenes, though, the nonprofit ideal was already under intense strain, and Musk didn't like what he saw. \"Guys, I've had enough. This is the final straw,\" Musk wrote in an email to his co-founders in 2017. He warned that he would \"no longer fund OpenAI\" if it turned into a tech startup instead of a nonprofit. Altman wrote back the next morning: \"i remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!\"Altman vs. MuskIn February of the following year, Musk left the OpenAI board, and said at the time the move was to avoid a potential conflict of interest as his car company, Tesla, dove deeper into AI. The story was more complicated.Musk sued OpenAI and Altman in early 2024, alleging they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop AI \"for the benefit of humanity broadly,\" and he's regularly criticized OpenAI's close ties to Microsoft, its principal backer. He also went to court to try and keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit entity and, earlier this year, went so far as to try and acquire the AI lab for $97.4 billion. In October, OpenAI announced it had completed a recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business, which is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.watch nowMusk isn't the only early OpenAI team member who's turned into a bitter rival. Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in late 2020 to form Anthropic, which said last month that Microsoft and Nvidia would invest in the company. The valuation from the funding round could reach as high as $350 billion.Anthropic's Claude family of large language models is one of the biggest competitors to OpenAI's GPT models. Altman is wagering that he can win the race by outspending the competition. While his company has sketched out plans for a trillion-dollar-plus AI infrastructure outlay, Anthropic has made roughly $100 billion in recent compute commitments, spaced out at various intervals over the next few years.It all amounts to a giant bet that demand for AI services will continue apace. \"We've got all the various AI vendors making these huge capital investments,\" said David Menninger, executive director of software research at ISG. \"There's a question as to how long those capital investments continue and whether or not they all pan out.\"Luria says Anthropic and others are making reasonable commitments based on their current growth trajectory and the funding they've already secured. But he said OpenAI's approach has been based on a \"fantastical set of commitments\" with a \"faint belief that those numbers are even possible.\" 'Pretty extreme'Altman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that OpenAI is already seeing enough demand to justify its spending plans, which \"makes us confident that we will be able to significantly ramp revenue.\"\"It's obviously unusual to be growing this fast at this kind of scale, but it is what we see in our current data,\" Altman said, adding that \"the demand in the market is pretty extreme.\" Altman said last month that he expects annualized revenue to hit $20 billion by the end of this year and to reach hundreds of billions by 2030. Its historic pace of growth has been a big boon for major tech companies. Oracle signed a roughly $500 billion deal to sell infrastructure services to OpenAI over five years. Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom have woven OpenAI-linked demand into multi-year forecasts. But Oracle's shares plunged 11% on Thursday after the software vendor reported weaker-than-expected revenue, a miss that dragged down Nvidia, CoreWeave and other AI-related stocks. Despite a surge in long-term contract commitments from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia, investors are growing concerned about Oracle's debt load that's fueling its buildout. watch nowStill, venture capitalist Matt Murphy of Menlo Ventures, said that in his 25 years in the venture business, \"this is the mother of all waves.\"Murphy, an early investor in Anthropic, said the combination of AI models, custom chips and hyperscale data centers adds up to the potential for trillion-dollar outcomes. That explains the eye-popping level of capital expenditures and the astronomical valuations, he said.Altman recently declared a \"code red\" inside his company, and shuffled resources to focus on making ChatGPT faster, more reliable and more personal, while delaying work on ads, health and shopping agents and a personal assistant called Pulse. His declaration came after Google released its Gemini 3 model last month, further accelerating the search giant's ascent in the market. On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT-5.2, a faster, more capable reasoning model that the company says is its best system yet for everyday professional use. It also struck a three-year, $1 billion content and equity deal with Disney around the Sora AI video generator.Altman downplayed the threat from Google, telling CNBC that Gemini had less of an impact on the company's metrics than OpenAI initially feared. \"I believe that when a competitive threat happens, you want to focus on it, deal with it quickly,\" Altman said.He said he expects the company to exit code red by January.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.watch now",

    "body": "Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Digital Ltd., exits a Correctional Services Department vehicle as he arrives at the Court of Final Appeal for the verdict of his bail hearing in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. Prosecutors in Hong Kong charged Lai, a prominent critic of Beijing and local authorities, last year under the national security law imposed by Beijing, saying he had colluded with foreigners by calling for sanctions against China. Photographer: Chan Long Hei/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHong Kong pro-democracy activist and media baron Jimmy Lai on Monday was found guilty of sedition and collusion with foreign countries by a Hong Kong court.The 78-year-old was charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law, enacted by Beijing in 2020 after pro-democracy protests swept the region in 2019. The court said Lai was guilty of a \"conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.\" It also said that Lai and his tabloid Apple Daily, requested a foreign country or entity outside of China \"to impose sanctions or blockade, or engage in other hostile activities\" against Hong Kong or China. The court, in its 850-page judgement, said that the businessman \"harbored his resentment and hatred of the PRC [People's Republic of China] for many of his adult years.\"  Lai, one of the CCP's most vocal critics, had pleaded not guilty to two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials. He has been under arrest since 2020, with his trial starting in December 2023. Lai's sentencing is expected to be on Jan. 12.Speaking just after the judgment, Andrew Collier, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the verdict was \"not very good\" from a foreign investor perspective, adding \"people want an independent court system that's going to protect the rights of citizens and the financial community.\"He said the verdict on Lai was expected, but the question for Hong Kong is around investor confidence. While the city has seen a growing number of IPOs in 2025, \"if investors are not comfortable with the court system, with cases like Jimmy Lai's, that's not good for the future of Hong Kong,\" Collier said. Lai, who founded Asian clothing brand Giordano, newspaper Apple Daily and digital media company Next Digital, was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea back in October. Trump pressed Xi to release Lai during the meeting, according to Reuters. The court said that Lai's \"only intent\" was to seek the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party, adding \"even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the PRC and the HKSAR [Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China]. This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications.\" Speaking to CNBC before the verdict, veteran investor David Roche suggested that a lenient approach could be good for Hong Kong's business climate. \"That, I think, would help to give the overriding impression and therefore conviction to people in the money business that Hong Kong had returned to its normal, business driven, dynamic self.\" Lai acquired British citizenship before Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. The trial verdict is the latest development in Hong Kong's political scene, which has seen the erosion of democratic opposition in one of Asia's financial hubs since the enactment of the national security law. Under changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in 2021, the number of directly elected members in the city's legislature was drastically slashed, with only \"patriots\" reviewed by an election committee allowed to stand for elections.  Monday's verdict comes on the heels of the dissolution of Hong Kong's last pro-democracy party on Sunday after 31 years, as well as a \"patriots-only\" legislative election that saw the second lowest turnout in the region's history. In a response to CNBC, Kenneth Roth, visiting professor at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and a former director at Human Rights Watch, said that the decision \"underscores the utter demise of the political freedoms that had once made the city so great.\"",

    "body": "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president, arrives for a hearing at the Constitutional Court of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTo justify a case for martial law, former President Yoon Suk Yeol tried to provoke neighboring North Korea into taking military action, South Korean prosecutors alleged Monday, according to domestic media. Speaking to reporters, special counsel Cho Eun-suk said that Yoon and his military commanders tried to lure North Korea into mounting an armed aggression against the South, but this failed as Pyongyang did not resort to military force. Cho and his team have indicted 24 people, including Yoon and five cabinet members, on insurrection charges following a six-month investigation.Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung had said on the 1-year anniversary of Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration that North Korea sending of trash balloons over to South Korea might have been provoked by Seoul's actions, although he did not elaborate at that time.Lee had also vowed \"strict accountability\" for the perpetrators behind the failed martial law attempt, with investigations and trials still underway.In July, Reuters reported that the special counsel had sought to detain the head of a military drone unit, over accusations that Yoon had ordered a covert drone operation into North Korea to raise tensions between the two countries.Cho also said that Yoon had masterminded a plan in October 2023 to suspend the powers of South Korea's parliament and replace it with an emergency legislative body. South Korean media outlet Yonhap also reported that Yoon also sought to portray the April 2024 general election results, lost by his ruling party, as electoral fraud led by anti-state forces.The 2024 election saw the then-opposition Democratic Party, led by Lee, hold on to its majority in the National Assembly. After being removed from office in April, Yoon has been charged with insurrection, which carries the maximum penalty of death.South Korean prosecutors have also reportedly sought a 15-year prison term for former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Other senior officials, including Yoon's defense minister and the former head of the National Intelligence Service, have also been arrested in connection with the attempt to impose military rule.On Dec. 3 last year, Yoon had abruptly declared martial law in a late night address, before lawmakers — including members of Yoon's own party — rushed to overturn his order. Yoon withdrew his decree six hours after his announcement. Imposing martial law led to impeachment motions against Yoon, which resulted in him being impeached on Dec. 14 last year and removal from office on April 4. ",

    "body": "South_agency | E+ | Getty ImagesFor older Americans, financial fraud can be a very costly mishap. Last year, scams reported to the Federal Trade Commission by adults age 60 and older reached $2.4 billion, up 26.3% from $1.9 billion in 2023 and 300% from $600 million in 2020, according to the FTC's annual report to Congress, released earlier this month. The increase is driven by scams that involve individual losses of $100,000 or more, accounting for $1.6 billion, or 68%, of the total amount.However, because most fraud goes unreported, the agency estimates the real losses experienced by older adults in 2024 may be as much as $81.5 billion. The bulk of money lost was due to investment scams.These significant losses can contribute to financial insecurity at a time when many consumers are already struggling to keep up with rising costs and are worried about running out of money in retirement.\"This crime is not just financial,\" said Kathy Stokes, director of fraud prevention programs at the AARP Fraud Watch Network. \"Some people have everything taken from them, and they'll still say the emotional impact is the hardest.\"Banks, lawmakers are taking aim at financial fraudWhile older adults are more likely to report large losses, financial fraud against consumers of all ages has been increasing over time. Last year, $12.8 billion in losses overall was reported to the FTC, up from $3.4 billion in 2020. Again, however, underreporting means the actual 2024 amount could be far higher: as much as $195.9 billion, according to the FTC report.At the same time, financial institutions and lawmakers have been paying closer attention.Many banks and other financial institutions ask accountholders for a \"trusted contact,\" which is someone who can be contacted in certain circumstances, including when financial exploitation is suspected. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, requires brokerages to make a reasonable effort to add a trusted contact to accounts, although investors are not required to provide one.Additionally, a proposal that aims to help combat elder fraud is pending in Congress. Called the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, the proposed legislation would let certain financial institutions delay executing suspicious transactions that may be due to financial exploitation, among other provisions. The House version (H.R. 2478) cleared committee in September; the Senate bill (S. 2840) is awaiting consideration by the Banking Committee.How scammers get the moneyAs technology has evolved, criminals have capitalized on the expanded ways to reach their potential victims — i.e., emails, texts, social media and online ads.For example, a seemingly innocent text from a stranger may evolve into a trusting relationship, and when the scammer suggests putting money toward a great investment, the now-trusting person sends funds to an account they believe will be returned with huge gains.\"It can be really difficult to recover the money,\" said Kathleen Daffan, an assistant director with the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The scammers move really quickly to get the money … and move it elsewhere, often overseas.\"Older adults are also more likely than younger adults to report losing money on tech support scams; prize, sweepstakes, and lottery scams; romance scams and government impersonation scams, according to the FTC report.Nevertheless, there are ways to try helping older parents or other loved ones avoid being a victim. How to talk to victims: Avoid blameFor starters, you can simply discuss the potential for fraud and how scammers try to find new victims.For example, \"if [a stranger] contacts you out of the blue and there's urgency, that's a really good sign that someone is trying to defraud you,\" Stokes said.You can also sign up to receive consumer alerts on the FTC's website so you'll be aware of the latest scams and can share the information with others.For a scam involving a victim who trusts the scammer, there's a good chance loved ones won't know about it unless they notice the person seems preoccupied or their behavior otherwise seems off.\"I'd say if an older adult is engaged in a relationship like this, where it involves trust and money, the criminals are telling them not to tell anyone,\" Stokes said.If the victim is asked to pay via gift card, cryptocurrency, cash, wires and bank transfers, it can be very difficult to reverse those transactions, Daffan said.\"We always suggest people call, right away, the entity that was involved with the transfer of the money,\" Daffan said. \"If it's a gift card, call the card issuer. If it's a bank, call the bank. Ask that a hold be placed on the transaction and ask if it's possible to get the money back,\" she said. \"But we see often that it doesn't work.\"If fraud has already happened and the money is irreversibly gone, it's important not to make the victim feel guilty, Stokes said.The AARP recommends talking to victims with empathy instead of derision or blame.",

    "body": "Anastasiia Krivenok | Moment | Getty ImagesWith many federal student loan borrowers struggling to repay their debt, consumer advocates and financial advisors say it's crucial that consumers know about the U.S. Department of Education's affordable repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Unfortunately, some don't.\"Many borrowers end up paying more than necessary simply because they aren't aware of the full range of relief options available to them,\" said certified financial planner K.C. Smith, managing associate at Henssler Financial in Kennesaw, Georgia, which ranked No. 46 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025.Indeed, 15% of federal student loan borrowers said they have heard \"nothing at all\" about the government's income-based repayment plans, according to a new survey by The Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit that advocates for college affordability. Nearly a quarter of borrowers, or 23%, said they didn't know about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and 47% of borrowers were not aware of a program that cancels loans for certain disabled borrowers. The survey, conducted in September, is based on responses from more than 1,000 self-identified federal student loan borrowers. It is concerning how many student loan borrowers are in the dark about programs that can help them stay current and eliminate their debt sooner, said Michele Zampini, associate vice president of federal policy and advocacy at The Institute for College Access & Success, or TICAS. \"Enrolling in an income-based repayment plan that lowers their monthly payment is often the only way a borrower can afford to stay out of default,\" Zampini said. Many borrowers would likely benefit from the option, which can drop payments as low as $0. More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Tump administration said earlier this year.Borrowers are reeling from a weakening labor market, as well as a barrage of changes to the student loan system and recent trouble accessing programs under the Trump administration, experts say.Still, key relief options are available. Here's what borrowers need to know about them. $0 monthly payments on IDR plans Congress created the first income-driven repayment plans, or IDRs, in the 1990s to make student loan borrowers' bills more affordable. The plans cap monthly payments at a share of a borrower's discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. Under the plans, some people end up with a zero-dollar monthly payment. \"For those with federal student loans, evaluating whether they qualify for an income-driven repayment plan can be an important way to improve cash flow,\" Smith said.The Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan is now defunct, after a court blocked the program. And President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out some other IDR plans. But borrowers will retain access to at least one plan, if not more. The best option for many borrowers looking for another affordable repayment option now that SAVE is unavailable is the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, experts said. Under the terms of IBR, borrowers pay 10% of their discretionary income each month — though that share rises to 15% for certain borrowers with older loans. Current borrowers will maintain access to IBR. But those who borrow after July 1, 2026, will be able to enroll in only one IDR plan, known as the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP.Under RAP, monthly payments will typically range from 1% to 10% of your earnings. The more you earn, the bigger your required payment. Bills can be as low as $10 a month on RAP. You can submit a request for an IDR plan at StudentAid.gov. Student loan forgiveness programs are available Despite recent changes, the Education Department continues to offer a wide range of student loan forgiveness programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Loan Forgiveness. PSLF allows certain not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans cleared after 10 years of on-time payments. Under TLF, those who teach full-time for five consecutive academic years in a low-income school or educational service agency can be eligible for loan forgiveness of up to $17,500.Borrowers may also be eligible for loan forgiveness if their school suddenly closed or they're diagnosed with a serious disability, Smith said. At Studentaid.gov, borrowers can search for more federal debt cancellation opportunities. Meanwhile, The Institute of Student Loan Advisors has a database of student loan forgiveness programs by state.Disclosure: CNBC receives no compensation from placing financial advisory firms on our Financial Advisor 100 list.

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 59 prior information technology companies and their average return on these situations is 36.92% versus an average of 20.01% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Additionally, Starboard has taken a total of 163 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.26% versus 14.34% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Dec. 9, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Clearwater Analytics and is urging the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers.Behind the scenesClearwater Analytics is a provider of front-to-back, cloud-based investment accounting solutions. The company has steadily taken share from legacy solutions, such as BlackRock, State Street and SS&C, as they are widely viewed as the premium modern platform. In 2016, private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe became the majority investor in the company. In 2020, Warburg Pincus and Permira made minority investments, and, about a year later, these three firms took the company public at $18 per share. Clearwater performed fairly well from its IPO through 2024, supported by consistent growth and historically strong margins that drove a premium valuation relative to peers, and these sponsors were rewarded accordingly. Warburg and Permira, which owned 22%, each sold their positions entirely and WCAS, which owned 56%, reduced its stake to roughly 1% by November 2024, at prices as high as $29.11 per share.Shortly thereafter, the company started making a string of acquisitions — a public company, Enfusion, and two private businesses, Beacon and Bistro. All of these transactions were announced between January and March of this year and closed within the following few months. The consequence of this is that Clearwater shifted from being a clean high-growth vertical software story with strong margins, a premium valuation, and a net cash balance, to a riskier, less certain integration story with leverage around 3x EBITDA. Unsurprisingly, the market questioned the company's decision to change course so sharply as well as its ability to integrate these three acquisitions while continuing to maintain its core organic growth story, and the stock sold off sharply, ultimately reaching a low of $15.73 per share after its third-quarter earnings report last month. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that Clearwater had engaged advisers to evaluate strategic options after receiving a bevy of unsolicited offers from firms like Thoma Bravo and even Warburg Pincus and Permira, both of whom still had representatives on the board. These announcements prompted Starboard to disclose its nearly 5% position in Clearwater and urge the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers. But don't misunderstand Starboard's motive or thesis. They are not short-term strategic investors jumping on an opportunity for a quick return. They have likely been looking at Clearwater for many months and had owned it because they like the standalone story and see an opportunity to create long term value. But, to paraphrase the overused quote attributed to Mike Tyson (but really said by Cus D'Amato), everyone has a plan until they get hit. And Starboard is as good as anyone with rolling with the punches. So, when news surfaces that the company is considering a sale and that two of its board members may be bidders, Starboard is doing what any good activist would do and making sure there is a fair process to maximize value for shareholders. Starboard will then decide whether that price is better than the risk adjusted value shareholders could receive from a standalone plan of integrating the acquisitions and growing the core business. Moreover, a credible and fair process could likely attract additional bidders, including strategics such as BlackRock and Nasdaq. While the leveraged buyout math works in the high $20s per share, strategics could push it to a 3 handle.  There could be a quick resolution here if the board decides to sell to the company and receives a bid that is good for everyone. But that is a risky activist thesis on its own. What makes this a good activist campaign for Starboard is that they are a believer in the company as a standalone entity and see a path to create shareholder value. If the standalone path is ultimately pursued, it would make a lot of sense for the private equity investors who no longer own any material position to resign from the board and be replaced with industry experts and a shareholder representative who can guide management through a standalone plan. Essentially, there are three potential outcomes to Clearwater's current inflection point: (i) a standalone plan where the company integrates its acquisitions and grows its core; (ii) a sale of the company for a satisfactory premium following a real and competitive review process; or (iii) an abbreviated sale process orchestrated in part by Warburg and Permira resulting in a sale to Warburg and Permira. Starboard would likely be happy with (i) or (ii) and we expect them to do everything within their power to prevent (iii).Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrediction markets swung sharply Friday after President Donald Trump said Kevin Warsh has risen to the top of his list to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.On Kalshi, Warsh's odds jumped to as high as 40% from about 15% after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Warsh is a top contender. Meanwhile, the implied probability of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett becoming the next Fed chair dropped below 60% briefly from 80% not long ago.Asked directly whether Warsh was now his leading choice, Trump responded, \"Yes, I think he is,\" according to the paper. The comments quickly reverberated through prediction markets.Trump did imply that Hassett is still very much in the running as well and the NEC director is still leading the race on Kalshi.\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump said.Hassett had been the clear market favorite for months, but by Friday afternoon his odds dipped as investors priced in Trump's latest signal.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post. Kalshi has essentially eliminated their chances for getting the top job.Trump also on Friday reiterated his long-held view that the Fed chair should consult the president on rate policy. Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, as he continued to urge for lower interest rates. The Fed has reduced the fed funds rates by three-quarters of a percentage point since September.",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday told investors what to look out for next week on Wall Street, including new economic data and earnings from FedEx and manufacturer Jabil.He also remarked on this week's big decline in tech stocks. He said he still believes in the power of artificial intelligence and suggested some of these names might be worth buying once their valuations come down.\"We need every piece of data to keep up on what's really happening as the money rotates from the Magnificent Seven to all these other different other areas, kind of like a fire hose,\" he said.Tuesday brings the Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report. Cramer noted that Wall Street has largely been in the dark about macroeconomic data for the past few months thanks to the lengthy government shutdown. A strong jobs report could call into question the need for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, Cramer said, while weaker figures mean the central bank can keep easing. Retail sales data is also set to be released on Tuesday, and Cramer added that this report needs to be weak to justify more cuts.Jabil and General Mills are set to report Wednesday. Cramer noted that Jabil is a major manufacturer of infrastructure and hardware for data centers. He said the company's earnings could reverse the declines in AI stocks. Cramer indicated he'll be waiting to hear from industry giant General Mills, noting that a number of food stocks have struggled recently due to the popularity of GLP-1 weight loss drugs and a growing emphasis on healthier eating habits.On Thursday, Darden, Cintas, Nike and FedEx will report. While the rising price of beef has hurt some restaurants, Cramer suggested restaurant giant Darden has been protected by its Olive Garden chain, which he said has \"minimal beef exposure.\" He said uniform and safety equipment supplier Cintas will be a solid measure of how small businesses are faring. It may be too soon to expect a turnaround at Nike, Cramer continued, but FedEx could be the \"star of the week.\" He praised the shipping company's management, adding that the e-commerce boom seems set to to continue. Friday brings earnings from Carnival, Conagra and Paychex, and Cramer suggested all three reports will provide valuable insight. Carnival can speak to the state of discretionary spending, Conagra can show whether consumers are cooking more meals at home, and payroll processer Paychex can give a read on small and medium-sized businesses.watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nike.Questions for Cramer?

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at 10 Downing Street, in London, Britain, December 8, 2025. Toby Melville | ReutersUkraine has said it's willing to give up its aspirations to join NATO in return for security guarantees, as part of a peace deal to end the almost four-year war with Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered to drop Kyiv's NATO dreams during five hours of talks with U.S. officials Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin over the weekend. Witkoff said \"a lot of progress was made\" during the talks, which are set to continue on Monday.Ukraine's offer marks a major policy shift. It has long coveted membership of the Western military alliance, whose members are obliged to consider an attack on one as an attack on all under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the offer to drop NATO membership in return for security guarantees was a compromise, amid resistance among some of its Western allies to its NATO bid.\"From the very beginning, Ukraine's conditions – or perhaps more accurately, our ambition – was NATO membership. And that would have provided real security guarantees. Some partners from the United States and Europe did not support this direction,\" he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat on Sunday.\"That is why today the bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the United States, specifically Article 5–like guarantees from the United States for us, and the security guarantees from our European colleagues for us, as well as from other countries such as Canada and Japan – these security guarantees for us provide an opportunity to prevent another outbreak of Russian aggression,\" Zelenskyy commented.\"And this already is a compromise on our part,\" he said.Despite Ukraine publicly abandoning its NATO bid, the chances of it joining the alliance were vanishingly thin. Several members were resistant to the idea, including Moscow-friendly Slovakia and Hungary. Even Ukraine's allies within NATO worried about poking the Russian bear beyond Ukraine's borders.Moscow vehemently opposes Ukraine joining NATO, and Russia has claimed the alliance's expansion in Eastern Europe was one of the reasons it launched its so-called \"special military operation\" against Ukraine in 2022.Kyiv insists that security guarantees must be a part of a peace deal instead of NATO membership, and this remains a sticking point in negotiations with Moscow, which is refusing to allow Ukraine's allies to be part of any peacekeeping force in the country.Talks about a draft peace agreement are continuing on Monday. Zelenskyy aide Dmytro Lytvyn said that the president would comment on the talks once they were completed, Reuters reported.The Kremlin said Monday that it expected to be briefed later on the outcome of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. on Monday.When asked to comment on Kyiv relinquishing its NATO ambitions, and what security guarantees Russia could accept in a potential peace deal, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said:\"This issue is one of the cornerstones. And, of course, it requires special discussion against the background of all the others. But that is precisely what the negotiation process consists of, which I would like to emphasize once again - we do not want to engage in megaphone diplomacy.\"",

Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people. Blurred individuals done by Versant Media. Date and context unclear.Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. The photo has Clinton's signature on it.Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. This story will be updated with their responses.\"This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,\" a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shows Donald Trump with an unknown woman. Redaction from the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Date and Context is unclear.\"Images also include thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties,\" the statement said. \"Committee Democrats are reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead. Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.\"Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.\"Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein.

Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing,\" the Republicans said. \"Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors.\"Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on child sex trafficking charges filed by the DOJ during Trump's first term in office.Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her 2021 conviction of crimes related to procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Jeffrey Epstein with Alan Dershowitz.

Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip,\" Urena said. \"He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.\"— Additional reporting by CNBC's Kevin Breuninger",

    "body": "Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard and Gaten Matarazzo star in Season 5 of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: NetflixThe original concept for what would become \"Stranger Things\" was rejected by more than 15 studios before landing a spot on Netflix's roster of original programming. A decade later, the show created, written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer has become one of the biggest cultural touchstones of the streaming era and has solidified Netflix as not just a competitor, but a leader in the space.\"People always talk about Netflix and [say] our big moment was when we'd put on 'House of Cards,' and that was a big deal. But our real moment was when we put on 'Stranger Things,'\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles last month.\"'House of Cards' was great. It kind of told the world that we're going to make some really good TV shows,\" he continued. \"But with 'Stranger Things,' this was a lot closer to a 'Star Wars' moment. This is a show, characters that move the culture, that spawned live events and consumer products and spinoffs and sequels.\"The final bowReleased in 2016, \"Stranger Things\" is set in the '80s and centers on a group of middle schoolers in a fictional rural town in Indiana who must navigate paranormal and supernatural occurrences following the disappearance of their friend. In the mix is a young girl with psychokinetic powers who has escaped from a secret research lab, an alcoholic police chief who is trying to find the missing boy and a frantic mother.Now, almost a decade later, the fifth and final season is making its staggered debut on Netflix.An advertisement for \"Stranger Things\" on one of Netflix's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, Dec. 2, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersVolume 1, which consists of the first four episodes, debuted over the Thanksgiving holiday and amassed 59.6 million views in the first five days, the biggest premiere week for an English-language series on Netflix. It ranks third overall behind Season 2 and Season 3 of the Korean series \"Squid Game.\"In its second week on the platform, Volume 1 generated another 23.6 million views, topping the streamer's weekly charts, and each of the previous four seasons saw week-over-week viewership bumps, as fans rewatched prior episodes, Netflix reported.Volume 2 of \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which contains three episodes, arrives on Christmas, and the finale episode, which has a run time of a little over two hours, is set for New Year's Eve. The finale will be available for viewing in select theaters New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In a break with tradition, Netflix will not be selling tickets for these screenings. Instead, more than 500 domestic cinemas will sell concession vouchers that will guarantee seating for the showings. These vouchers can be used toward purchases of food and beverages at the venues. Furthermore, theater owners will keep all revenue from these purchases.Netflix and exhibitors have tangled in the past over release terms, as the streamer does not commit to a prolonged run in theaters for movies that it wants to be eligible for awards contention. \"Nothing would make us happier than to play Netflix theatrical movies in our theaters,\" AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement earlier this month. \"We think that could be beneficial for all involved. But as we need to treat our existing studio partners fairly, there is much that still needs to be sorted out to that end. Even so, there is progress.\"Turning culture upside down\"Stranger Things\" has brought about a renaissance of the 1980s, reviving fashion trends, music and even discontinued food brands for a new generation.When the series debuted, Netflix partnered with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like, but it was predominantly working with licensees. This means it was collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.In 2019, the company launched its own consumer products division and two years later its own officially licensed online shop.Coinciding with the launch of the final season of \"Stranger Things,\" Netflix announced dozens of partnerships and collaborations with brands across the merchandise, retail and restaurant spectrum. The streamer has tapped Lego, Funko, Squishmallows, Hasbro, Jazwares and Care Bears to bring \"Stranger Things\" toys and collectibles to fans of the series. It has apparel and lifestyle deals with Gap, Nike, Crocs, CoverGirl, Zara and Wrangler, among others, and food and beverage collaborations with the likes of Eggo, Doritos, Kellogg, Gatorade and Starbucks.Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the first season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: Netflix\"We are incredibly excited to partner with so many fantastic brands, offering fans — and fellow nerds — the largest collection of products and experiences in 'Stranger Things' history and one of our biggest campaigns yet as we celebrate the fifth and final season of this globally beloved series,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, in a statement earlier this month.Outside the retail space, Netflix has delved into the live event space, bringing \"Stranger Things\" to life through an immersive experience that enables fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will open in Mexico City next month. There is also a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which has been running in the West End in London since 2023 and in New York since this spring.In addition, Netflix has a deal with Epic Games that has brought \"Stranger Things\" items to the popular online video game Fortnite. Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is more than a way for the company to generate revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels, industry experts said.The cast of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" Season 5.Courtesy: NetflixThis playbook is not unique to Netflix, but it showcases the maturation of the streaming service. \"Strangers Things\" is less of a blueprint that can be adopted by every Netflix show or film, but rather a gold standard for what is possible.\"[Netflix] had a few good shows early on ('Orange is the New Black' and 'House of Cards'), but it took a couple of years of whiffs before they came up with 'Stranger Things,'\" Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush, told CNBC via email. \"They have had a ton of success since, with shows like 'Squid Game' and 'Bridgerton,' but it was questionable if they could settle on a formula for coming up with original IP.\"'Stranger Things' has remained a solid IP throughout, and has driven a lot of recognition,\" he added.",

In September, OpenAI said it had a partnership with Oracle worth more than $300 billion over the next five years. \"We have a good relationship with OpenAI,\" Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two newly appointed CEOs, said at an October analyst meeting.Doing business with OpenAI is relatively new to 48-year-old Oracle. Historically, Oracle grew through sales of its database software and business applications. Its cloud infrastructure business now contributes over one-fourth of revenue, although Oracle remains a smaller hyperscaler than Amazon, Microsoft and Google. OpenAI has also made commitments to other companies as it looks to meet expected capacity needs. In September, Nvidia said it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia equipment for the San Francisco artificial intelligence startup. The first phase of that project is expected in the second half of 2026.Nvidia and OpenAI said in a September statement that they \"look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.\"But no announcement has come yet.In a November filing, Nvidia said \"there is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity.\"OpenAI has historically relied on Nvidia graphics processing units to operate ChatGPT and other products, and now it's also looking at designing custom chips in a collaboration with Broadcom. On Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan laid out a timeline for the OpenAI work, which was announced in October. Broadcom and OpenAI said they had signed a term sheet.\"It's more like 2027, 2028, 2029, 10 gigawatts, that was the OpenAI discussion,\" Tan said on Broadcom's earnings call. \"And that's, I call it, an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed with respect to a very respected and valued customer, OpenAI. But we do not expect much in 2026.\"OpenAI declined to comment.WATCH: Oracle says there have been 'no delays' in OpenAI arrangement after stock slidewatch now",

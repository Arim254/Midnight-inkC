    "body": "Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split Thursday, a move that changes nothing fundamentally about the company, but could make the pricey individual shares more accessible to the retail investor.Existing shareholders as of Nov. 10 will receive nine additional shares for each one they hold. They'll get that allotment on Nov. 14, and the stock will begin trading at the new post-split price on Monday, Nov. 17.Netflix, the streaming leader whose shares have boomed over the last three years to above $1,000 apiece, said it was making the change to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.\"Netflix shares added more than 2% after hours on the split announcement. The stock closed Thursday at $1,089 a share, up 42% for the year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNetflix, 5 yearsThe stock is currently one of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with a price above $1,000. It's common practice for companies that reach those levels to split the shares, although the effectiveness of such a move is debatable with the widespread use of fractional trading available on brokerage platforms.A split simply gives each holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change at all. All fundamental measures for the company remain the same. Warren Buffett has famously refused to split the shares of Berkshire Hathaway for this reason, with the stock priced at more than $717,000 a share. Buffett did create a 'B' class of shares that are more modestly priced at $478 each.Netflix has split its shares twice before, in 2015 and 2004.",

    "body": "The Google AI Studio application is displayed on a mobile phone with Google in the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on October 26, 2025. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle will offer its Gemini AI service for free to over 500 million Reliance Jio users in India, as global artificial intelligence firms double down on acquiring customers in the country.The U.S. tech giant revealed Thursday that it had signed a pact with Reliance Intelligence, a joint venture between Reliance Industries and Meta, to provide Google's AI Pro plan, which includes Gemini 2.5 Pro, expanded access to NotebookLM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage, among other things.Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, said his firm aims to make India \"AI-empowered\" through collaborations with strategic and long-term partners such as Google. Reliance Jio is India's largest telecom services operator.Google services, worth 35,100 rupees per user ($396), will have a staggered roll out with early access for 18- to 25-year-old users on unlimited Jio 5G plans for for 18 months. Eventually they will be made available for free to the company's entire customer base.\"I'm excited for how this partnership will help expand access to AI across India,\" said Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google and Alphabet.There are about 377 million Gen Zs in India, driving $860 billion in consumer spending in the country, and that is set to rise to $2 trillion by 2035, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group.India has the highest number of users globally across social media platforms such as Facebook (350 million-plus), Instagram (413.8 million), video app YouTube (over 467 million) while messaging app WhatsApp has over 500 million users, making it a key market for digital services. In July, the second largest Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to offer its 360 million customers free access to Perplexity Pro, which is priced at $200 per year globally.Airtel and Perplexity followed this up with intensive campaigns on social media platforms, enlisting leading Indian influencers who posted reels promoting the use-cases for the free AI tool.Indian telecom market is dominated by Jio and Airtel and partnerships with these telecom operators offer the opportunity for companies to expand the reach of apps and digital tools, making them available to a mass audience.On Tuesday, OpenAI reportedly said it would make its ChatGPT Go plan free for users in India for a year, starting Nov. 4. The offer was launched in August for 399 rupees per month, and was among the most affordable subscription plans from OpenAI.The company is rapidly expanding its presence in India, its second largest market, and plans to set up a 1 gigawatt data center in the country.",

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesContent from The Walt Disney Company, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV on Thursday after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement Thursday.More than 20 channels, including ABC and ESPN, and Disney content recordings would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said.The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time.Disney did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. The mass media and entertainment conglomerate was the first to warn about the potential content removal last week.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement, adding that if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company will offer members a $20 credit. YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month,  content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Chinese-made automobiles and construction machinery are assembled and shipped for export at Yantai Port in Yantai City, Shandong Province, China, on October 21, 2025.  Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's manufacturing activity in October contracted more than expected, shrinking to the lowest level in six months, an official survey showed on Friday, as trade tensions with Washington reignited during the month.The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 49.0, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, missing economists' expectations for 49.6 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates growth while one below that suggests contraction. The latest reading reversed the recovery in recent months, after the PMI rose to a six-month high of 49.8 in September, compared to 49.4 in August and 49.3 in July.The sub-indexes tracking production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all sunk further into contraction, official data showed, pointing to a deeper manufacturing slowdown and softer demand.The non-manufacturing PMI, covering construction and services, ticked up to 50.1, boosted by the renewed momentum in air and railway transportation, accommodation, cultural and sports-related entertainment activities. October saw an eight-day Golden Week holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to 8.The NBS composite manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI dipped to 50, its lowest level since December 2022, according to Wind Information.Huo Lihui, NBS chief statistician, attributed the slowdown to the weeklong holiday that shuttered most factories in China, and an \"increasingly complex international environment.\" The country's manufacturing activity has remained in contraction since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump's started his tariff campaign, pressuring Chinese factories.China's economy expanded 4.8% in the third quarter, marking the slowest growth in a year. Adding to the constraint on the economy, fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year — the first such decline since pandemic-hit 2020 — according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.Large industrial firms saw their profits surge the most in nearly two years, rising 21.6% in October from the same period a year earlier, as declines in factory-gate prices eased amid Beijing's campaign to rein in a bruising price war and excess capacity.Domestic demand has remained sluggish, with a protracted property slump and soft labor-market conditions eroding households' spending power.China and the U.S. reached a trade truce on Thursday after months of rising tensions, de-escalating the situation that had threatened to push the world's two largest economies into a full-blown trade war.Trump said the U.S. would immediately cut the 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese goods by half, and in turn, Beijing would resume \"massive\" purchases of American soybeans and other farm products. China also agreed to pause its sweeping rare-earth controls for a year while taking steps to stem the flow of precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production. Both sides agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports.But analysts cautioned that the meeting fell short of a comprehensive pact that addressed matters core to the U.S.-China rivalry and other contentious issues, including Taiwan, making the deal vulnerable to another escalation in the delicate detente.\"As the trade negotiation went successfully yesterday, the macro policy in China will likely stay unchanged for the rest of this year,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, expecting more proactive fiscal policy early next year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA day after securing a deal for rollback of U.S. tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Asia-Pacific countries to support free trade, and maintain supply chain stability. \"The more turbulent the times, the more we must work together,\" Xi said in a Chinese state media readout Friday, translated by CNBC. He was speaking at the first session of the Asia Pacific-Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' meeting that runs through Saturday.Xi arrived in South Korea Thursday and met with U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time since 2019.China and U.S. agreed to grant 1-year concessions over tariffs, export controls, and other issues in a relative thawing of relations impacted by tit-for-tat trade measures. U.S. cut tariffs on Chinese goods by 10 percentage points, while Beijing agreed to allow exports of critically needed rare earths.Trump returned to the U.S. Thursday, while Xi stayed on for the summit. In his speech, the Chinese leader reiterated his view that the world was undergoing changes not seen in a century, and emphasized how Beijing was offering global opportunities in the face of growing instability and uncertainties in the Asia-Pacific region.Xi, who did not directly mention the U.S. or tariffs, shared five suggestions for cooperation at the APEC summit: safeguarding the multilateral trading system, creating an open economic environment, maintaining supply chain stability, promoting green and digital trade and fostering inclusive development.He emphasized the need for the countries to join together and \"extend\" the supply chain, rather than disconnecting from each other.That could run up against the U.S. emphasis on reshoring manufacturing, even as Xi highlighted in his meeting with Trump that \"China's development and revitalization goes hand in hand with President Trump's vision to 'Make America Great Again.'\"Over the last two decades, Chinese companies have doubled down on production and the country now accounts for about 27% of global manufacturing net output. As labor costs and tariffs have risen, the Chinese factories have spread to the Asia-Pacific region, while local demand has also grown.watch nowTrump has sought to use tariffs and other policies to encourage companies to bring the factories back to the U.S. New U.S. tariffs announced this year have also sought to reduce transshipments — exports of Chinese goods made through other countries.Since the first round of trade tensions with the U.S. about seven years ago, the Association of Southeast Asian Countries has become China's largest trading partner, surpassing the European Union.China will keep \"opening up\" its market to foreign business, and keep providing new opportunities for Asia Pacific and the world, Xi said Friday.Asia was the top destination for Chinese outbound investment in the third quarter, followed by Africa and Europe, Rhodium Group said in a report Thursday. Chinese companies announced $15.4 billion in investments in Asia during that time, the most since the pandemic, with deals including data centers and battery materials.",

Analysts polled by StreetAccount had expected $32.42 billion, or growth of 18.1% from a year earlier. Operating income rose 9% from a year ago to $11.4 billion, also beating estimates and accounting for about two-thirds of Amazon's total operating profit. AWS is the world's top provider of cloud infrastructure, but it's facing intensifying pressure from competitors Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.Google's cloud revenue increased 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.Amazon's earnings report comes a little over a week after AWS experienced an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites. Microsoft was hit with outages in its Azure cloud and 365 services on Wednesday, hours before its scheduled earnings release.Amazon officially opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier on Wednesday. The facility, first announced last year, is intended to train and run models from Claude creator Anthropic. Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025.The new data center could help Amazon battle the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services.

Cardenas | Afp | Getty ImagesSpaceX said it has pitched NASA a \"simplified mission\" to put astronauts back on the moon following criticisms over delays by Sean Duffy, the space agency's acting administrator.In a company blog post out Thursday, Elon Musk's aerospace and defense contractor said: \"We've shared and are formally assessing a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations that we believe will result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety.\" Earlier this month, Duffy said in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, that SpaceX was behind schedule on building its lunar landing system for NASA's Artemis III mission and that the agency would reopen the landing contract for that mission to competitors such as Jeff Bezos' rocket maker Blue Origin.A NASA spokesperson in an email to CNBC said that the agency \"has received and is evaluating plans from both SpaceX and Blue Origin for acceleration of HLS production.\" \"Following the shutdown, the agency will issue an RFI to the broader aerospace industry for their proposals,\" the spokesperson said. \"A committee of NASA subject matter experts is being assembled to evaluate each proposal and determine the best path forward to win the second space race given the urgency of adversarial threats to peace and transparency on the Moon.\"NASA had previously said that SpaceX and Blue Origin would have until Oct. 29th to propose new ways to speed up the project.Musk initially responded to Duffy by posting to his social network X, \"Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!\" In another post, Musk wrote: \"The person responsible for America's space program can't have a 2 digit IQ.\"SpaceX's massive Starship has flown 11 test flights so far, uncrewed. The last two flights were deemed successful, but the company has not yet shown all the in-orbit refueling capabilities it requires before embarking on the Artemis III, manned lunar mission.Blue Origin has been developing a lunar lander for NASA and has received about $835 million from the space agency since their contract began in 2023. The company plans to launch a smaller scale version of their lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1.Meanwhile, China is aiming to land its astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade.In September, in an all-hands meetings with NASA employees, Duffy told his staff that he was irked by \"shade thrown\" on the space agency at a Senate hearing in which some attendees doubted that the U.S. could put astronauts back on the Moon before China could land its astronauts there.Besides its lunar mission, China also announced it is sending a new crew to its orbiting lab, the Tiangong space station, this week. China built this space station after it was excluded from access to the International Space Station due to U.S. national security concerns.SpaceX is paid when it achieves different milestones under its NASA contract for the HLS (human landing system integrated lander).According to USA Spending, which tracks federal contracts, NASA has already paid approximately $2.7 billion to SpaceX for the \"design, development, manufacture, test, launch, demonstration and engineering support\" of the HLS. The agency is obligated to pay around another $300 million for milestones SpaceX achieved, and Musk's company stands to earn a total of $4.5 billion (or another $1.5 billion) from the HLS contract if they achieve all milestones.SpaceX today said, in their company blog post, that they \"self-funded\" 90% or more of the program, which would imply they have spent over $30 billion already.As CNBC previously reported, some NASA employees have been required to work without pay for the space agency during the federal government shutdown if their jobs support Artemis missions.SpaceX and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.",

    "body": "Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after ringing a bell on the floor setting the share price at $47 in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesReddit reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday in which the company beat on the top and bottom and provided strong guidance.Shares were up more than 8% in after-hours trading on Thursday.Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. 51 cents expectedRevenue: $585 million vs. $546 million expectedReddit's sales jumped 68% year-over-year in the third quarter, while net income was $163 million, which was $133 million more than the $30 million it logged the previous year during the same period.The company said it expects fourth-quarter sales to come in the range of $655 million to $665 million, ahead of the $638 million that Wall Street was expecting.Reddit said it expects its adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter to be between $275 million and $285 million, topping StreetAccount's projections of $259 million.The company said third-quarter global average revenue per user was $5.04, ahead of analyst estimates of $4.82.Third-quarter revenue in the U.S. came in at $480 million, surpassing StreetAccount estimates of $445 million. Reddit generated international third-quarter sales of $105 million, ahead of the $104 million that StreetAccount projected.Reddit's \"Other revenue\" category, which includes the company's data licensing business, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. Google and OpenAI are the some of Reddit's biggest data licensing partners.The company said global daily active uniques for the third quarter grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing analyst estimates of 114 million.Reddit's logged-in DAUq for the U.S., its most lucrative region, rose 7% year-over-year to 23.1 million during the third quarter. That was slower than the 12% year-over-year jump Reddit recorded during the second quarter when logged-in DAUq for the U.S. was 22.9 million. This the fifth quarter in a row in which the company sees its U.S. logged-in user growth slow.The company's third-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 14% year over year to 50.2 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 24% to 65.8 million.Investors have been watching for any changes to Reddit's user growth amid Google increasingly debuting generative AI features like AI Overview, which provides summaries to search questions. Reddit has seen a wave of users come to its platform from Google, and the social media company makes more advertising-related money from users who create accounts.Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts on Thursday that the company is not currently seeing any major traffic from AI-powered chat apps.\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they're not a major traffic driver today,\" he said. \"But I think there's plenty of opportunity there as we continue to work together.\"In response to an analyst's question about how Reddit plans to convince more people to create accounts and routinely use its app, Huffman reiterated previous comments about improving the platform's user experience.The company is working on \"making sure there are no barriers\" preventing users from seeing relevant content based on their interests, Huffman said.\"The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,\" he said. \"It's not rocket science.\"Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong said that the company is increasingly running performance-marketing campaigns intended to attract more users, particularly those overseas, who may not be aware of the platform. Although the company has not historically relied on marketing to obtain new users, Wong said the promotions will help in countries \"where our awareness and consideration is lower than in the U.S., because we're newer.\"\"We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,\" Wong said. \"And we saw movement in brand awareness and consideration, which I think was also positive and provides a foundation for performance later.\"Google and Meta both reported their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday in which both tech giants surpassed Wall Street expectations.WATCH: Looking to see if Meta AI can reach consumer scale.watch now",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

    "body": "A Honda sedan moves down the assembly line on Jan. 28, 2025 at the automaker's assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Michael Wayland / CNBCGlobal automakers are once again bracing for production disruptions due to a potential shortage of automotive semiconductor chips, this time sparked by the Dutch government amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.Honda Motor became the first known automaker this week to reduce production due to the problem that involves chips from Netherlands supplier Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese company Wingtech Technology Co.The industry was hopeful that a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Asia would provide some relief, but no resolution on the chips issue has been announced.Volkswagen on Thursday reportedly said it has until at least next week before its supplies impact production, while other major automakers have said they are monitoring the situation around the clock, attempting to mitigate disruptions.\"The chip situation from Nexperia, we have a cross-functional 'war room' in the building where I'm sitting that has this as [a] primary job,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told investors during a quarterly call Thursday. \"And every day we are pushing actions and projects to extend our period. There is a day-by-day management of what is an industrywide global issue.\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSuch \"war rooms\" have become a regular practice in the automotive industry amid supply chain disruptions, which have become more common since the Covid pandemic rattled production and deliveries of many parts, including chips, starting in 2020.Several automotive industry insiders confirmed to CNBC that war rooms have been established in their companies, as they look into alternative purchasing methods. They included working with major suppliers in an attempt to find alternative sources as well as buying on the open market.\"Suppliers across the motor vehicle industry are working to understand the potential effects on production and supply continuity,\" MEMA, the largest vehicle supplier association in the U.S., said in an emailed statement. \"Chips and diodes are foundational to automotive components and systems, from infotainment systems to door handles, to steering and braking. Even the absence of a single diode or chip can disrupt the manufacture of vehicles.\" NexperiaThe situation involving Nexperia began late last month, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that tech from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm in Europe's auto industry.German automakers are especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as \"Tier 1s,\" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said this week that carmakers were close to closing production lines because of the chip shortage, which comes four years after a shortage of such parts amid the coronavirus pandemic.A close-up view of the Nexperia plant sign in Newport, Wales on April 1, 2022. Matthew Horwood | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation,\" ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement.The chips affected are legacy semiconductors used in basic vehicle functions such as windshield wipers and window controls — parts that lack sufficient alternative sources, according to S&P Global Mobility.A Nexperia spokesman referred to a previous statement from the company, which summarized the ongoing situation and said it is seeking an exemption from the export restrictions and working to mitigate the impacts of the decision.A Wingtech spokesperson on Thursday condemned the Dutch government's actions, saying the company \"will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so.\"\"Only by restoring full control and ownership rights to the company's rightful shareholders and management, and by ceasing political interference in corporate governance, can the Dutch government begin to repair the damage to its reputation, de-escalate international tension, and safeguard its own and European economic security,\" the spokesperson said via an emailed statement.Fluid situationHonda's production cuts impacts include all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\"We are currently managing an industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue, making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts and meet the needs of our customers,\" Honda said Thursday in an emailed statement, calling it a \"fluid\" situation.The impacts are expected to continue to spread to other automakers if a resolution is not found.Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley last week said the chip problem was at the forefront of conversations when he made a trip to Washington, D.C, earlier this month. He called it a \"political issue,\" saying the company is working with the U.S. and China administrations to resolve it.\"It's an industrywide issue. A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry,\" said Farley, adding that automakers have gotten \"really good\" at maximizing component purchases such as chips following the crisis in 2021.General Motors CEO Mary Barra made similar comments last week, calling it an \"industry issue\" that will hopefully be resolved soon.\"While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate,\" she said during the company's quarterly earnings call.Other automotive executives from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and more have also shared similar thoughts with investors and the media.\"This is a politically induced situation ... which means that the solution to this, or the resolution to this, resides in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, in this case, with Europe kind of caught in the middle,\" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said Wednesday during an earnings call.",

The Fed was not as certain, and Powell made it a point to say so yesterday. The result is a mild re-set in yields back to levels that are more consistent with a December cut being a solid possibility, but not a full lock.\" The recent drop in rates had caused a run on refinances, with those applications up 111% last week year over year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Last week, President Donald Trump reversed plans for a \"federal surge\" in San Francisco. The potential National Guard deployment hit the headlines when Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to the city.Benioff's sentiments were supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump administration. Benioff quickly backtracked as criticism mounted. Unlike California Governor Gavin Newsom, Lurie has tried to avoid clashing with Trump since taking office in January. But he has spoken up to say that the city is progressing on business development and crime, often citing data to back up his claims.In Thursday's interview, Lurie's first on television since the Trump incident, the mayor said there's plenty of hard work ahead.\"I felt that pressure in January, I feel it today,\" Lurie said, when asked about support from tech leaders. \"I think they understand... when San Francisco is strong, America is strong.\" watch nowLurie, a moderate Democrat, pointed to an array of data that show the city is making progress on a post-pandemic comeback, largely driven by the boom in investment and usage of artificial intelligence. CBRE data on venture funding show 2025 is expected to surpass the record reached in 2021, thanks in large part to AI investments in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. In addition, crime rates are down 30% from 2024, as event bookings and tourism are up, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is getting hot.\"We have a lot of competition out there in the world, and we are on the rise,\" Lurie said. \"Anything that would have hindered that rise is something that we don't need.\"Lurie is also leveraging philanthropic commitments to work with the city in cleaning up streets and supporting small businesses. He shared on CNBC Thursday that the San Francisco Downtown Development Corporation has now raised $50 million for this effort, up from the $40 million at launch. The goal is to spark a comeback, with the help of the tech boom in the city, but one that paves the way for all businesses to thrive, he said.\"What we're trying to build here is a broad-based recovery at City Hall,\" Lurie said. \"Our job is to create the conditions so that not only these [tech] companies can succeed, but our restaurants and small businesses can succeed. We're stripping away red tape. We're telling everybody that we're open for business. We want you here, and we want you to be part of the community.\" ",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the keynote address at the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKorean semiconductor giant Samsung said on Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphic processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.The 50,000 Nvidia GPUs will be used to create a facility Samsung is calling an \"AI Megafactory.\" Samsung didn't provide details about when the facility would be built.It's the latest splashy partnership for Nvidia, whose chips remain essential for building and deploying advanced artificial intelligence.The collaboration with Samsung comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced in Washington, D.C., that Nvidia was selling collaborating with companies including Palantir, Eli Lilly, CrowdStrike and Uber.Shortly after the speech, Huang was spotted in South Korea drinking beer with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other business leaders, according to local media. Other Korean companies, including SK Group and Hyundai, are also deploying similar amounts of GPUs, Nvidia said.\"We're working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,\" Raymond Teh, Nvidia's senior vice president of Asia-Pacific, said on a call with reporters on Wednesday.The partnerships support Huang's claim on Tuesday that Nvidia has a book of business that totals $500 billion from its current generation GPU, called Blackwell, in addition to its next-generation GPU, called Rubin.The forecast helped boost Nvidia's stock, making the company the first to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.On Thursday, Nvidia representatives said they will work with Samsung to adapt the Korean company's chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia's GPUs. That process will results in 20 times better performance for Samsung, the Nvidia representatives said. Samsung will also use Nvidia's simulation software called Omniverse. Known for its mobile phones, Samsung also said it would use the Nvidia chips to run its own AI models for its devices.In addition to being a partner and customer, Samsung is also a key supplier for Nvidia.Samsung makes the kind of high-performance memory Nvidia uses in large quantities, alongside its AI chips, called high bandwidth memory. Samsung said it will work with Nvidia to tweak its fourth-generation HBM memory for use in AI chips.WATCH: Night out in Seoul: Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai bosses bond over fried chicken and sojuwatch now",

    "body": "Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., opens the door during the first day of in-store sales of Apple's latest products at Apple's Fifth Avenue store in New York, US, on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025. Kena Betancur | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple reported fiscal-fourth quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the company's December quarter.  Shares of the iPhone maker rose in extended trading.Here's how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Sept. 27: EPS: $1.85 vs. $1.77 estimated  Revenue: $102.47 billion vs. $102.24 billion estimated  Here's how Apple's main business lines did versus consensus estimates:  iPhone revenue: $49.03 billion vs. $50.19 billion estimated  Mac revenue: $8.73 billion vs. $8.59 billion estimated  iPad revenue: $6.95 billion vs. $6.98 billion estimated  Other Products revenue: $9.01 billion vs. $8.49 billion estimated  Services revenue: $28.75 billion vs. $28.17 billion estimated   Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach that revenue in the current quarter will increase by at least 10%.\"We expect total company revenue to grow by 10 to 12% year over year, we expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits, year over year, and we expect that that would make the December quarter the best ever in the history of the company,\" Cook said. Analysts polled by LSEG expect Apple to guide to $132.31 billion in December quarter sales and earnings of $2.53 per share. Apple's guide surpasses those expectations. With 11% growth over last year's December quarter, revenue for the upcoming period would be $137.97 billion.Cook said that Apple was confident in its guidance because of the strong reception for the company's new iPhone 17 devices, released in September, which he said was \"off the chart.\"  \"We look at the results to date, the reception of the consumer on the very strong iPhone lineup,\" Cook said. \"We're looking at traffic in our stores, which is up significantly year on year. We see enthusiasm around the world.\"The company had $27.46 billion in net income during the quarter versus $14.29 billion in the year-ago period, which was lower because of a one-time tax charge.  For Apple's fiscal 2025, it had $416 billion in total revenue, a 6% increase over 2024. Sales in the September quarter rose 8% on an annual basis. watch nowOverall iPhone revenue was up 6% to $49.03 billion, the first sign of how iPhone 17 sales are faring. Apple's newest phones went on sale on Sept. 19, so there is just over a week of sales in this quarter. However, LSEG analysts were looking for $50.19 billion in iPhone sales for the period.  Cook said that several iPhone models were supply constrained during the quarter — both for the iPhone 17 and last year's iPhone 16 models. \"Currently, we're supply constrained on several models of the iPhone 17,\" Cook said.Apple's iPad business was also flat during the quarter, with $6.95 billion in sales. Apple didn't release a new model during the quarter, but it introduced an upgraded iPad Pro with an updated M5 chip in October. The company's services business, which includes online subscriptions such as iCloud,  Apple Music, as well as App Store fees, Google search licensing, payment fees, and AppleCare warranties for hardware, grew 15% to $24.97 billion in sales. The unit is Apple's fastest-growing and important for investors because it represents recurring revenue with a higher profit margin than hardware.  Cook said that most of the components in the Services business were seeing accelerating growth.  \"It was a run of the table,\" Cook said. Apple CFO Kevan Parekh said on an earnings call with analysts that Apple expects similar Services growth in the current quarter.Other Products, a category that includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Vision Pro, declined very slightly during the quarter with sales of $9.04 billion.  Apple's Mac business showed strong 13% growth to $8.72 billion in sales. Cook attributed the growth to strong sales of the company's MacBook Air laptop, which were refreshed in March alongside a $100 price cut, lowering its starting price to $999.  The company's sales in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 4% on an annual basis to $14.5 billion in sales.\"We expect China to return to growth this quarter because of the reception of the iPhone there, or the iPhone 17 family,\" Cook said.  Cook said that the company still plans to release an updated version of Siri next year, and said that there were more forthcoming partnerships like the company's agreement to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence.  \"Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,\" Cook said.  Cook said that Apple had not changed its prices in response to Trump administration tariffs. Parekh said the company incurred $1.1 billion in additional costs related to tariffs during the September quarter. He said Apple expects $1.4 billion in tariff costs on an earnings call with analysts in the December quarter, and that the company's gross margin would be between 47% and 48%.\"We held the pricing that we would have done without any tariffs, and we're just absorbing the tariffs in gross margin,\" Cook said. Apple's gross margin was 47.2%, better than LSEG expectations of 46.4%.  WATCH: If you are an Apple investor, this is a 'pound the table moment'watch now",

    "body": "A Chipotle logo is displayed on a sign at a shop on June 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill tumbled as much as 19% in trading Thursday after the company cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third straight quarter.Including Thursday's move, the stock has fallen 45% this year, dragging its market value down to roughly $43 billion. At least five Wall Street analysts have cut their price targets for the stock after the report, anticipating investors' displeasure with the burrito chain's shrinking traffic and gloomy outlook.\"It's difficult to call a bottom for sales given the multitude of factors weighing on demand,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a research note, revising his price target from $54 to $44 per share.In the third quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.3%, but the chain's traffic fell. While many restaurant chains have suffered in recent years as diners wracked by inflation eat out less, analysts were unsure if the chain's value perception contributed to Chipotle's issues. While its burritos and bowls average about $10, consumers often assume its average prices are closer to the $15 entrees of its fast-casual peers, executives said on the conference call.\"While we knew that traffic had slowed for Chipotle into the fall, we were surprised by the magnitude that was reported last night and the resulting deleverage this produced,\" BTIG analyst Pete Saleh wrote in a note. \"We're admittedly perplexed by how suddenly this traffic weakness came about, and not convinced affordability concerns are the main driver here.\"watch nowCEO Scott Boatwright said on Wednesday's earnings conference call that diners are visiting less frequently, particularly those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old, a key demographic for the company. Same-store sales have worsened so far in October, and the company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will shrink in the fourth quarter and fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year.\"We are very concerned that the menu and marketing actions taken so far have not sufficiently offset the traffic retraction,\" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said.Still, most analysts attributed the slowdown to industrywide challenges, not company-specific issues that Chipotle needs to address. Unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation are weighing on consumers' spending, according to Boatwright.\"We believe the brand remains fundamentally healthy (stable share of customer restaurant wallet) and expect a return to growth as the macro improves,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle's weak performance bodes poorly for its fast-casual peers, like Sweetgreen and Cava. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour called fast-casual restaurants \"This Season's Halloween Scare\" in his research note covering Chipotle's earnings report.Shares of Sweetgreen fell 6% in trading Thursday, while Cava stock was down 8%. Both are slated to report their third-quarter results next week.Correction: The company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year. An earlier version misstated the percentage move.",

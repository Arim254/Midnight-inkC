    "body": "The logo of SoftBank is displayed at a company shop in Tokyo, Japan January 28, 2025. Issei Kato | ReutersShares of SoftBank Group plunged nearly 9% on Friday, marking its third straight day of selloff after the Japanese giant said it had sold its entire stake in U.S. chip giant Nvidia for $5.83 billion.The stock pared losses to trade 6.57% lower as of 3 a.m. ET, marking the second straight week of selloff after the conglomerate saw almost $50 billion in market cap wiped out last week — its worst weekly loss since March 2020.\"The sell-off of SoftBank today is less idiosyncratic to SoftBank, and more driven by broader market sentiment on semiconductors and technology stocks,\" said Rolf Bulk, a senior equity analyst at New Street Research.\"In that context and with SoftBank's holding discount still very low vs. historic averages, SoftBank trading down 5-6% today does not surprise me.\"SoftBank disclosed in its latest earnings that it offloaded 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October and scaled back its T-Mobile stake, bringing in $9.17 billion.Although the Nvidia sale surprised some investors, it isn't the first time SoftBank has exited the U.S. chip giant. Its Vision Fund had accumulated roughly $4 billion worth of Nvidia shares in 2017 before selling out entirely in early 2019.Even so, SoftBank continues to have business ties to Nvidia. The Tokyo-based company is involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSeveral other tech stocks in the region also declined. Semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest and Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, fell by over 3% and 4% respectively.Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, fell 2.04%. South Korean memory chip giant SK Hynix was more than 5% lower, while Samsung Electronics lost 3.8%.Shares of Tencent declined 5.61%, while JD.com was down 4.31%.Overnight in the U.S., technology giants came away battered.

    "body": "Move over, coastal hubs: many of the best cities for Gen Z workers are located in the Midwest, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company.Using data from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Checkr ranked the top cities for Gen Z workers based on their scores in three key areas: employment, affordability and social life.Checkr calculated the employment score for each city based on its unemployment rate and labor force participation. To determine the affordability score, Checkr analyzed income to rent ratio, real personal income and the percentage of renters paying over 30% of their income.Each city's social life score is based on the Gen Z portion of the population in each city and the number of Gen Z members per entertainment establishment. Employment and affordability were weighted 40% each, while social life was weighted 20%.For Gen Z workers making entry-level salaries, \"it's going to be really difficult to survive and save money\" in major cities like Los Angeles and New York, according to Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr.Cities like Des Moines and Milwaukee may not have the same hustle and bustle, but they can offer lower costs of living and slower-paced lifestyles, Radbil says.The cities on this list provide both \"career momentum and lifestyle alignment in a single package,\" he says.Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for Gen Z workers.1. Madison, WisconsinMadison secured the top spot because of its proximity to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Radbil says.Students from all over the country are drawn to the school due to its academics, sports and social scene, Radbil says, and the city is a \"great starting point\" for grads to begin their careers.Beyond the university, Madison's proximity to Chicago and Milwaukee means that young people have access to \"very strong job opportunities\" in the area, according to Radbil.2. Minneapolis, MinnesotaOne of the larger cities in the Midwest, Minneapolis offers city comforts paired with a low cost of living.Minneapolis is also attractive to Gen Z workers because of its progressive values and welcoming social scene, Radbil says.3. Des Moines, IowaDes Moines has a thriving insurance industry, which provides ample job opportunities for Gen Z workers interested in that sector, Radbil says.Beyond that, the city offers affordability and a low cost of living, which provide \"a growing appeal to younger workers who want a meaningful start without that big city burnout.\"4. Omaha, NebraskaOmaha \"blends that Midwestern charm with pretty real economic momentum,\" according to Radbil.Gen Z workers can find ample jobs in the insurance, finance and education sectors, and a \"small startup ecosystem\" is also developing, Radbil says.Notably, legendary investor Warren Buffett calls Omaha home, he says.5. Nashville, TennesseeNashville is best known for its music roots, but the city also boasts a growing tech presence and a \"very cool entrepreneurial scene,\" Radbil says.Radbil compares Nashville to Austin \"without the insane rent prices yet,\" although the city's popularity is likely to drive up the cost of living, he says.Still, Gen Z workers are attracted to Nashville because \"the lifestyle there is so appealing,\" he says.6. St. Louis, MissouriAffordability is the main draw for St. Louis, Radbil says.Its low cost of living is attractive to young workers looking to settle down and purchase a home, according to Radbil.\"St. Louis gives you that opportunity to maybe get a start for a lower price, and really feel like you have some roots and you own something, which is important to people,\" he says.7. Austin, TexasAustin is a \"Gen Z magnet,\" according to Radbil.The city's atmosphere is \"very young and culturally rich, and there's so much to do outside,\" he says.Economically, Austin is also flourishing: its business-friendly environment has attracted large companies like Tesla and Apple, and the startup scene is booming, according to Radbil.As a result, \"the job market is incredible,\" Radbil says.8. Milwaukee, WisconsinMilwaukee is an attractive option for Gen Z workers due to its strong job market and reasonable cost of living, according to Radbil.While young professionals may only be able to afford tiny studios in major cities, in Milwaukee, \"you could get an apartment overlooking Lake Michigan,\" Radbil says.The city also offers a robust social scene and \"amazing\" summer weather, he says.9. Salt Lake City, UtahSalt Lake City is \"one of the most balanced cities for Gen Z workers\" due to its growing economy, access to nature and relative affordability, Radbil says.It's also an \"awesome location\" for young professionals who work remotely, he says: \"All those mountain towns and cities out west have really grown in popularity.\"10. Boston, MassachusettsBoston is home to \"world-class\" universities like Harvard University and MIT, which attract thousands of young professionals across industries.\"The universities are so important to creating jobs for people,\" he says. \"Whether it's science or biotech or just working at the university, I think that the job opportunities there are awesome.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "watch nowWalmart CEO Doug McMillon is retiring early next year, after overseeing the top U.S. retailer's transformation into an e-commerce behemoth, the company said Friday in a filing.The longtime CEO will be succeeded by John Furner, the Walmart U.S. CEO, on Feb. 1, according to the filing.McMillon, who stepped into the top role at Walmart in February 2014, will officially retire as of Jan. 31. He will continue to serve as an executive officer of the company and be employed by Walmart as an advisor through Jan. 31, 2027.Furner, 51, has been the CEO of Walmart's U.S. business since 2019. In that role, he oversees more than 4,600 stores and the largest sector of the company. He started at the company in 1993 as an hourly associate.Walmart Inc. President and CEO Doug McMillon delivers a keynote address during CES 2024 at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Ethan Miller | Getty ImagesThe announcement of the CEO transition comes only six days before the retailer is set to report quarterly earnings. Walmart shares were up 13% this year as of Thursday's close, as the company grows its digital business and wins over more high-income shoppers.For more than a decade, McMillon, 59, has led the retail giant and overseen the company's growth as an e-commerce leader. He also oversaw the business during a tumultuous time marked by the Covid pandemic, supply chain disruptions, high inflation and tariff changes.During his time leading the company, Walmart's shares have risen nearly 300%. The company's stock fell more than 2% in premarket trading Friday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWalmart stock since Feb. 1, 2014.From hourly employees to CEOsMcMillon and Furner have had similar paths to the top role at Walmart. Both have spent about three decades at Walmart. They both began as hourly associates and moved up the ranks at the retail giant, serving in merchandising and operations roles. Both also served as chief executives of its warehouse club, Sam's Club.Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) announced that its Board of Directors has elected John Furner, 51, to succeed Doug McMillon, 59, as President and Chief Executive Officer of Walmart Inc., effective February 1, 2026.Courtesy: Walmart Inc.In a statement, Walmart chairman Greg Penner described Furner as \"the right leader to guide Walmart into the next chapter of our growth and transformation.\"\"After starting as an hourly associate and being with us for over 30 years in a variety of leadership roles across all three of our operating segments, John understands every dimension of our business – from the sales floor to global strategy,\" Penner added.\"Serving as Walmart's CEO has been a great honor and I'm thankful to our Board and the Walton family for the opportunity,\" McMillon said in a statement.He said Furner's \"curiosity and digital acumen combined with a deep commitment to our people and culture will enable him to take us to the next level.\"Along with Walmart, big-box competitor Target is also poised to get a new leader in early 2026. Target announced last month that Michael Fiddelke, chief operating officer and former chief financial officer, will succeed longtime Target CEO Brian Cornell on Feb. 1.Digital growth and workforce transformationAs the leader of Walmart, McMillon played an instrumental role in turning the nation's largest grocer into an e-commerce giant and positioning the company to sell more advertisements and more discretionary merchandise, along with dozens of eggs and gallons of milk.During his early years as CEO, McMillon greenlit the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in 2016, an e-commerce startup that Walmart hoped would fuel digital growth and give it credibility as it tried to fight back against Amazon's meteoric rise.The startup's acquisition — particularly its steep price tag — prompted debates in retail circles about whether the retail giant had overpaid for the asset and if that move was needed to help Walmart navigate a rocky entry into the world of e-commerce. Yet the deal gained Walmart talent with digital know-how, particularly Jet.com founder and serial entrepreneur Marc Lore who had sold his previous company, Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, to Amazon and worked for Amazon for years.During Lore's years as leader of Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business, Walmart bought digital native businesses including menswear company Bonobos and birthed other in-house concepts, such as mattress brand Allswell. Walmart later sold Bonobos and other digital businesses, and shuttered Jet.com in 2020.Though the Jet.com deal did not meet some Wall Street investors' expectations, McMillon on a call with analysts at the time credited the acquisition for \"jump-starting the progress we have made the last few years\" in digital growth and curbside pickup and delivery.Over the past five years, Walmart has leaned on its membership program, Walmart+, and its third-party marketplace as it tries to fend off Amazon's e-commerce dominance. It launched Walmart+, its own subscription service and its answer to Amazon Prime, in 2020 and has continued to add perks like streaming through Paramount+.Through its third-party marketplace, it has bulked up its merchandise offerings on virtual shelves by leaning on independent sellers to provide its customers with a wider range of clothing items, beauty brands and even luxury handbags. The model, which mirrored Amazon's approach, also allowed Walmart to make money in new ways, such as selling ads and fulfillment services to sellers.A CNBC investigation earlier this year found Walmart's marketplace boom came as it made it easier than Amazon did over time for sellers to join the platform. CNBC uncovered at least 43 vendors who had taken the identity of another business to sell on Walmart's marketplace, and some of those accounts were offering counterfeit beauty products.Elsewhere in the company, McMillon also shook up Walmart's pay structure for its hundreds of thousands of employees, announcing in 2015 that the company would give a raise to half a million hourly employees and increase wages to $9 an hour — a move that at the time faced sharp criticism on Wall Street.In more recent years, Walmart has hiked wages multiple more times. But it has faced persistent criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other politicians who have argued the company has failed to share enough of its profits with hourly employees through pay and benefits.As the nation's largest private employer, Walmart has also been closely watched as the rise of artificial intelligence brings workforce changes and could threaten employment.McMillon recently said that AI \"is going to change literally every job.\"In a statement, McMillon referred to the growth of AI being a new dynamic facing his successor. And, he said, Furner is \"uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday asked the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Friday that she had appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation.Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that \"Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.Because of that, he wrote, \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,.\"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" Trump wrote \"Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.'

The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers, Hoffman, as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesEmails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, \"I know how dirty donald is.\"In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: \"its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.\"Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.watch nowTrump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" The email does not explain what Epstein meant by thatIn another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added.This is breaking news.

    "body": "watch nowBillionaire investor Ron Baron isn't flinching during the latest tech selloff, and he's certainly not touching his own Tesla shares, he said.The longtime growth investor said he sees the pullback as a chance to spot bargains, even as volatility has rattled the biggest names in tech recently.\"Not very much,\" Baron said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" when asked what he's doing amid the drawdown. \"Just looking and trying to understand where opportunities are and try to take advantage of them.\"His conviction is especially intense when it comes to Tesla, one of his signature bets. He recalled selling a third of Baron Funds' Tesla holding a few years ago due to criticism from his clients and the media about the significant concentration in a single stock. Baron emphasized that his personal position remains entirely intact.\"We sold 30% for clients. I did not sell personally a single share,\" he said.Roughly 40% of his personal net worth is invested in the electric-vehicle maker, alongside 25% in SpaceX and about 35% in Baron mutual funds.Tesla shares are down 18% from their 52-week high and were on track to open 5% lower on Friday as investors this week rethink the AI-related shares that have led the bull market.Baron said he's already made about $8 billion from Tesla over the years, and he believes he could make five times that over the next decade.Baron recounted a promise he made to the board of his mutual funds when he sought approval decades ago to invest in public stocks, a pledge that effectively binds him to Tesla and SpaceX for life.\"I told the board, 'If you let me invest a certain amount of money, then I will promise that I won't sell any of my stock. I will be the last person out of the stock,'\" he said. \"I will not sell a single share of my shares until my clients sold 100% of their shares. ... And I don't expect to sell in my lifetime Tesla or SpaceX.\"",

    "body": "Eric Baker, co-founder and chief executive office of StubHub Holdings Inc., during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStubHub shares plunged 20% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported quarterly results for the first time since its initial public offering in September.Here's how the ticket vendor did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Loss per share: $4.27Revenue: $468.1 million vs. $452 million expectedDuring a conference call with investors, StubHub CEO and founder Eric Baker said the company wouldn't provide guidance for the current quarter.Baker said that the company takes \"a long term approach,\" adding that the timing of when tickets go on sale can vary, making it hard to predict consumer demand. StubHub plans to offer outlook for 2026 when it reports fourth-quarter results, he said.\"The demand for live events is phenomenal,\" Baker said. \"We don't see anything with consumer demand that's any different.\"Revenue increased 8% in its third quarter from $433.8 million a year earlier, the company said.StubHub reported a net loss of $1.33 billion, or a loss of $4.27 per share, compared to a net loss of $45.9 million, or a loss of 15 cents per share, during the same period last year. StubHub said this reflects a one-time stock-based compensation charge of $1.4 billion stemming from its IPO.Gross merchandise sales, which represent the total dollar value paid by ticket buyers, rose 11% year over year to $2.43 billion.The company faced tough comparisons from a year earlier, when results were boosted by Taylor Swift's massively popular Eras Tour. Excluding that impact, StubHub said GMS grew 24% year over year.Founded in 2000, StubHub primarily generates revenue from connecting buyers with ticket resellers. It competes with Vivid Seats, which was taken public via a special purpose acquisition company in 2021; SeatGeek; and Ticketmaster parent Live Nation Entertainment.\"We are building a truly differentiated consumer product that improves the experience for fans while unlocking better economics for venues, teams, and artists through open distribution,\" Baker said in a statement. \"We're early in that journey, but our progress so far gives us great confidence in our strategy and the long-term value we're creating.\"StubHub raised $800 million in its long-awaited IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, which came after it delayed its debut twice. The most recent stall came in April after President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs roiled markets. The company restarted the process to go public in August when it filed an updated prospectus.On Thursday, the company's stock closed at $18.82. Shares are now down roughly 20% from the IPO price of $23.50.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'",

Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder, is tapping an artificial intelligence tool from Portland, Oregon-based startup Prophetic to build more homes and address the country's housing shortage.Chronic underbuilding since the Great Recession has caused a deficit of roughly 4 million homes, according to analyses from several sources, including Zillow. The supply-demand imbalance has caused prices to rise over 50% from pre-pandemic levels.Homebuilders are trying to respond but say that the cost of construction, along with the difficult and costly process for acquiring and developing buildable lots, is making that difficult.\"One of the largest challenges to providing affordable housing is the identification, acquisition and entitlement of land suitable for development. We are confident the insights provided by Prophetic are going to help us expand homeownership opportunities for hard-working American individuals and families,\" said Jason Jones, vice president of data analytics at D.R. Horton, in a release.Prophetic has developed an AI-native platform for land acquisition and development analysis. For any potential parcel of land, Prophetic's software will pull every single zoning manual from every city and county in a state. The company said it is currently operational in 25 states and expects to be in all 50 by June.\"It's an incredibly large, tedious, detail-oriented process to take tens of thousands of these zoning documents and extract the rules, not only efficiently, but correctly,\" said Oliver Alexander, founder and CEO of Prophetic.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Among other things, the system looks at minimum lot size and minimum or maximum density setbacks, which differ by municipality and zone. It updates those quarterly. \"Then it tells you where that information came from, which is the key differentiator,\" Alexander explained. \"When you have that section title and the page that it came from, that builds trust, and then it becomes ultra-efficient, where you can analyze development potential in 30 seconds instead of two to three hours.\"Alexander said there are a little over 440,000 different ways to describe what you're allowed to do on a piece of dirt in the states Prophetic has analyzed. Developers need to go through all of that information to figure out if they can build a single- or multifamily housing development on it. The AI's large language model-based analysis of these documents at scale can answer the questions and then feed that into search AI, which Alexander calls \"the major unlock\" – search plus the zone AI information together. At the ground level, with this AI, builders can figure out what they can build, where and how much at a much faster pace, making them more competitive with landowners.\"If you have that much of an edge in your speed to decision, you effectively control your entire market, because before anyone else can decide, you've tied it up,\" said Alexander.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on Oct. 31, 2025 in West Palm Beach, Florida.Samuel Corum | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump is once again on the warpath against a major global media company, having threatened the BBC with a $1 billion lawsuit this week.The British public broadcaster found itself in hot water after airing a documentary in which Trump's Jan. 6 speech in 2021 was edited to make it look like he was explicitly encouraging his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol.As concerns over the documentary came to light, the BBC went into crisis mode, with both its director general and head of news resigning. Meanwhile, BBC Chair Samir Shah said the corporation was assessing the \"very serious allegations\" and apologized for an \"error of judgment\" over the edit.The BBC on Thursday apologized to Trump and agreed not to show the documentary again on any of its platforms. It reportedly rejected the U.S. president's call for compensation, however. Trump told Fox News this week that he has an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC.Here's what's going on and why it matters:How did we get here?In October 2024, the BBC aired a Panorama documentary called \"Trump: A Second Chance?\" in which it showed Trump addressing supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.In the Panorama program, Trump was shown saying, \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol ... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\" The edit combined two separate parts of his speech, although this was not flagged to viewers, making it look like he had explicitly instructed his supporters to riot in a single statement.That was not the case as Trump had said, \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\" and only much later (in fact, around 54 minutes later) he said, \"and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a \"Save America Rally\" near the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe speech became infamous as Trump supporters descended on the Capitol after the address, with skirmishes breaking out with police and a number of protesters entering the building. At the time, Trump urged those involved in the riots to \"go home now.\"The documentary doesn't appear to have caused a fuss at the time, but the editing process came to light when a memo written by ex-BBC adviser Michael Prescott was leaked to the press in which he criticized editorial standards at the BBC.The Panorama documentary in the spotlight was not made by the BBC, but by a third-party production company called October Films. Nonetheless, questions have been asked as to why it was reviewed and approved for broadcasting. The documentary is no longer available to view on the BBC iPlayer.What does Trump want?A crisis engulfed the BBC as news of the rogue edit emerged. Director General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness resigned. But that has not stopped the scandal snowballing with questions centering on the BBC's editorial standards amid allegations of institutional bias.On Tuesday, the BBC issued a statement in which it said, \"we accept our edit created the impression we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from two different points in the speech.\"\"Consequently, this gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,\" it said, adding that \"there was no intention to mislead.\"A view of the BBC building as BBC Director-General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness have resigned after revelations that a documentary about U.S. President Donald Trump contained edited and misleading footage related to the 2021 Capitol riot, in London, United States on November 10, 2025. Rasid Necati Aslim | Anadolu | Getty ImagesTrump's legal team wrote to the BBC, demanding that it immediately retract what it said were \"false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements\" about the president in the documentary. The letter, which was published in full by Sky News, said the airing of the program had \"caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\"It warned that Trump would sue for $1 billion in damages unless the corporation issued a \"full and fair retraction,\" apologized and compensated the president \"for the harm caused.\"The letter, signed by Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito, said the BBC has until 5 p.m. EST on Friday Nov. 14 to comply with the president's demands, otherwise, \"he will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights ... including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"\"The BBC is on notice,\" the letter concluded.In his first comments on the matter, the president told Fox News on Monday that his Jan. 6 speech had been \"butchered\" in the Panorama edit. When asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, Trump said, \"Well, I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that.\"What happens next?The BBC on Thursday issued a statement on its Corrections and Clarifications page, saying it had reviewed the Panorama documentary following criticism over how Trump's Jan. 6, 2021 speech was edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the BBC said.\"The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgement,\" it added.A BBC spokesperson has said that while the corporation \"sincerely regrets\" the manner in which the documentary clip was edited, they \"strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"BBC News has reported that, \"if Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.\" There appears to be no evidence so far to suggest it has been shown in the U.S.The British government has defended the corporation, however, with Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy wanting to distinguish between \"editorial failings\" and the BBC's critics who, she said, were \" launching a sustained attack on the institution itself.\"U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also commented on the furore on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he believed in a \"strong and independent BBC.\"It's not the first time Trump has pursued legal action against big media organisations, with lawsuits launched against the Wall Street Journal, CNN, CBS, ABC and New York Times in recent years, with some cases settled and others dismissed.— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame ",
    "body": "Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame with U.S. mid-term elections on the horizon.Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period in the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The reasons for price increases are often complex and vary by region. But in at least three states with high concentrations of data centers, electric bills climbed much faster than the national average during that period. Prices, for example, surged by 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois and 12% in Ohio.The tech companies and AI labs are building data centers that consume a gigawatt or more of electricity in some cases, equivalent to more than 800,000 homes, the size of a city essentially.Virginia has the highest concentration of data centers in the world. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the state's recent governor's race in a landslide by campaigning on cost of living. Spanberger put at least part of the blame for rising electricity prices on data centers, promising to make tech companies \"pay their own way and their fair share\" of the escalating costs.The governor's race could be a harbinger of political headwinds for the AI industry's data center buildout with the mid-term elections just a year away and Democrats zeroing in on affordability as their central issue. In Washington, some Democratic senators are targeting the close relationship that President Donald Trump has developed with the leaders of the major tech companies and AI labs.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's \"sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,\" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from \"being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.\"\"The techlash is real,\" said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\"Data centers aren't always great neighbors,\" said Silverman, now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. \"They tend to be loud, they can be dirty and there's a number of communities, particularly in places with really high concentrations of data centers, that just don't want more data centers.\"Virginia, Ohio and IllinoisLooking at the top fives states for data centers can help sort out some of the politics of data centers from what is actually happening to electricity prices.Virginia, Illinois and Ohio are among those states and are mostly served by the same grid operator, PJM Interconnection. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., serving more than 65 million people across 13 states including New Jersey where Silverman advised the state utility board.The PJM grid is facing a major imbalance between demand and supply. It holds auctions to secure electric capacity from power plants to ensure the grid remains reliable. The auction for 2024 to 2025 resulted in a bill of $2.2 billion. The bill then surged more than 500% to $14.7 billion for 2025 to 2026.An independent watchdog that monitors those PJM auctions found that data center demand, actual and forecast, made up $9.3 billion, or 63% of the total power capacity bill for 2025 to 2026. In the latest auction, prices jumped another 10% to $16.1 billion.\"Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices,\" the firm Monitoring Analytics said in its June Independent Market Monitor report.Those capacity prices get passed down to consumers in their utility bills, Silverman said. The data center load in PJM is also impacting prices in states that are not industry leaders such as New Jersey, where prices jumped about 20% year over year. Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor's race in the Garden State in part on promising to freeze electric bill increases.\"It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now,\" Silverman said of data center impact on capacity prices.There are other reasons for rising electricity prices, Silverman said. The aging electric grid needs upgrades at a time of broad inflation and the cost of building new transmission lines has gone up by double digits, he said.The utilities also point to rising demand from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the broader electrification of the economy, such as electric vehicles and the adoption of electric heat pumps in some regions.Although some Democrats are blaming the White House, the conditions that led to rising electricity prices in the PJM region began before the second Trump administration took office.PJM's process for bringing new electric supply online has \"crashed and burned,\" Silverman said. Tax subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act led to a surge of renewable energy projects waiting for grid connection. PJM is struggling to keep up with approvals, which can take five years in some cases, he said.PJM's watchdog said the grid may have seen tight power supplies without data centers, but the demand growth would have been slower and allowed more time for the market to address it.\"It is misleading to assert that the capacity market results are simply just a reflection of supply and demand,\" the watchdog said, describing the rapid load growth from data centers as \"unprecendented.\"Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half during his first year in office. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen in the coming years due to tight supply and demand.\"It's hard to see utility bills coming down in this decade,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.Texas and CaliforniaIn other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear. Texas, for example, is second only to Virginia with more than 400 data centers. But prices in the Lone Star state increased about 4% year over year in August, lower than the national average.Texas operates its own grid, ERCOT, with a relatively fast process that can connect new electric supply to the grid in around three years, according to a February 2024 report from the Brattle Group.California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average. But prices in the Golden State increased about 1% in August 2024 over the prior year period, far below the average hike nationwide.One of the reasons California's electricity rates are so much higher than most of the country is the costs associated with preventing wildfires. PG&E, the largest utility in the state, said in March that it expects rates to remain stable this year as costs associated with wildfire prevention are taken out of customers' bills.",

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

    "body": "Swiss flag is pictured at the Harbor in Geneva, Switzerland, March 13, 2024. Denis Balibouse | ReutersThe U.S. and Switzerland have reached a trade deal, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Friday.Duties will be reduced to 15%, the Swiss government said in a post on X, adding that further details will be announced at 4 p.m. local time.As part of the deal, Swiss companies have pledged to invest some $200 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2028, which includes funding for education and training, according to a statement by the Swiss government.\"We've essentially reached a deal with Switzerland,\" Greer told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday morning.\"They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.\"Greer added that more details on the deal, which he said had \"really been in the works since April,\" would later be published on the White House website.watch nowThe deal means the country-specific tariff imposed on Swiss goods will match the rate levied on those brought to the U.S. from the European Union.\"Like all the president's deals, we keep a tariff,\" Greer said on Friday. \"We retain a tariff on these countries because we have to get the trade deficit under control. But because Switzerland, for example, has agreed to manage its trade surplus with the United States, in terms of making sure that things where they have a trade surplus with us — pharmaceuticals, gold, et cetera — their companies are going to build here, so it's going to eliminate some of the sources of that surplus.\"He pointed to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which pledged earlier this year to invest $50 billion in the U.S.\"The announcement of the reduction in additional US tariffs on Swiss imports will serve to stabilise bilateral trade relations,\" the Swiss government said in its Friday statement. \"Although overall tariffs remain higher than before the additional tariffs were introduced in April, the agreed reduction in additional tariffs is expected to have a positive impact on the Swiss economy.\"Back in July, President Donald Trump announced Switzerland would be hit with a 39% tariff rate, which took hold when a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials during last-ditch talks in Washington.That meant Switzerland was subject to one of the highest tariff rates imposed on an individual country by the Trump administration.Switzerland, an export-driven economy, has already taken a hit from the tariffs. Last month, Swiss officials cut the country's economic growth forecast for 2026, citing the \"heavy burden\" of the U.S. duties on its industries.Its biggest exports include watches, pharmaceuticals and precious metals, but the country is also renowned for its luxury goods, chocolate and skincare products.The Swiss franc added 0.4% against the greenback following the trade deal announcements on Friday.",

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about NVIDIA Omniverse as he delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "body": "An exterior view of the new JPMorgan Chase global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue on Nov. 13, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.\"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,\" Pusateri said in a statement. \"The free market worked.\"The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the \"open-banking rule\" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in \"anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior\" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.Wider impactThe deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  \"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.Source: RobinhoodProponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.\"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,\" Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.\"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,\" Lee said. \"We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.\"",

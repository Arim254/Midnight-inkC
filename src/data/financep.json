    "body": "The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG 52) launches a Tomahawk cruise missile to support Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn.Jonathan Sunderman | USNAVY | Corbis | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he's considering sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide \"a new step of aggression\" in its war with Russia.As the president travelled on Air Force One to the Middle East on Monday, first to Israel and then Egypt for talks on finalizing a peace deal for Gaza, when asked if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied \"we'll see... I may.\"He also signaled he could use the supply of Tomahawks to pressure Russia to end the war, telling reporters: \"I might say 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks.'\"The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that,\" he said, according to comments reported by Sky News.U.S. President Donald Trump holds an umbrella before boarding Air Force One, as he departs for Israel, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Oct. 12, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersTrump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have discussed the potential provision on Tomahawk missiles, which would allow Ukraine to launch robust counter-attacks against Russia.But the U.S. president is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding whether he will actually send the missiles to Ukraine. He said Monday that he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the matter. No such call has been scheduled, as yet, according to comments from the Kremlin on Monday.Russia has warned that any provision of long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv would be seen as a \"serious escalation.\"What are Tomahawks?Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles and can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace, according to U.S. manufacturer Raytheon.Designed for striking high value or heavily defended land targets, Tomahawks can be fired from ground launchers but are typically launched from ships or submarines, and can be armed with conventional or nuclear warheads. The missiles don't come cheap, with a reported average cost of $1.3 million each.Sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Preble conduct an operational tomahawk missile launch while underway in a training area off the coast of California.U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Woody PaschallFirst developed in the 1970s, they are used by the U.S. military and have been purchased — or with agreements to purchase — by a number of allies, including the U.K., Japan, Australia and the Netherlands.The latest version, called the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk, or TACTOM, has a data link that allows it to switch targets while in flight. It can loiter for hours and change course instantly on command.Raytheon notes that U.S. and Allied militaries have flight tested the GPS-enabled Tomahawk over 550 times and used it in an operational environment more than 2,350 times. Its most recent use came in 2024, when the U.S. and British navies launched Tomahawk missiles at Houthi rebel sites in Yemen.Russian reactionKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Moscow's leadership was waiting to see the specifics of any deal to supply Tomahawks, but was scathing about the prospect.\"This would be a serious escalation which, however, wouldn't change the situation for the Kyiv regime on the front lines. But it's important to understand that, leaving aside the details, we're talking about nuclear capable missiles. Therefore, this is truly a serious escalation.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during a summit of leaders of nations, which are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in Moscow, Russia October 8, 2024. Sergei Ilnitsky | Via ReutersOn Monday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that any Tomahawk supply could end badly for everyone, including Trump. He noted that it's impossible to distinguish between Tomahawk missiles carrying nuclear warheads and conventional ones after they are launched.\"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on Telegram, in comments translated by Reuters, seeming to hint that Moscow's response would be a nuclear one.Asked on Monday about Trump's comments that he would talk to Putin about Tomahawks, Peskov said \"there are no clear agreements on a phone call.\"Could they be a game-changer?Ukraine and its supporters say the supply of Tomahawks would greatly enhance the country's strike capabilities and the threat it poses to Russian assets, such as military bases, energy infrastructure and logistics hubs.Supplying Tomahawks could, as such, be another push factor that brings Russia to the negotiating table with Ukraine and its Western allies, particularly the U.S., wanting to see an end to a war that Moscow began in February 2022.Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Sunday that Kyiv was working closely with the White House to strengthen its defensive capabilities, including its long-range capabilities.\"We see and hear that Russia fears the possibility of the United States providing us with Tomahawks. It is a signal that this kind of pressure can be effective in achieving peace. President Trump and I agreed that our teams and our military will be working on all the matters we discussed,\" he said.A U.S. ship launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in this undated file photo.U.S. Navy | Getty ImagesAs Trump looks to cement an end of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, his attention could well turn back to Russia, with the president already signaling waning patience with Putin.In addition, Trump's publicized coveting of the Nobel Peace Prize (which he missed out on this year) could help spur the president on to deliver peace in Ukraine.\"That Trump did not get the Nobel peace prize this time could turn into good news for Europe. He wants the prize. But he still has to earn it,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, noted Monday.\"If Trump were to put enough pressure on Putin to stop the war against Ukraine, the U.S. president would indeed be the top candidate for the prize next year ... Media reports about potential deliveries of U.S. Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine suggest that Trump is getting tougher with Putin. That would be a start,\" Schmieding said.",

    "body": "A close-up view of the Nexperia plant sign in Newport, Wales on April 1, 2022. Matthew Horwood | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor maker based in the Netherlands, in an extraordinary move to ensure a sufficient supply of its chips remains available in Europe amid rising global trade tensions.Nexperia, a subsidiary of China's Wingtech Technology, specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries, making it vital for maintaining Europe's technological supply chains. On Sunday evening, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs revealed that it had invoked the \"Goods Availability Act\" on the company in September in order \"to prevent a situation in which the goods produced by Nexperia (finished and semi-finished products) would become unavailable in an emergency.\"Following the announcement from the Hague, Wingtech plunged its maximum daily limit of 10% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.The Goods Availability Act allows the Hague to intervene in private companies to ensure the availability of critical goods in preparation for emergency situations, and its use comes amid escalations in the U.S.-China trade war.The government statement said the \"highly exceptional\" move had been made after the ministry had observed \"recent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions\" within Nexperia.\"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities. Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,\" it said, identifying automotives as particularly vulnerable.Governance changesIn a corporate filing dated Oct.13, lodged with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wingtech confirmed Nexperia was under temporary external management and had been asked to suspend changes to the company's assets, business or personnel for up to a year, according to a Google translation.Wingtech chairman Zhang Xuezheng had been immediately suspended from his roles as executive director of Nexperia Holdings and non-executive director of Nexperia after the ministerial order, according to the filing.The filing added that Nexperia's daily operations will continue, with the impact of the measures not yet quantifiable.\"The Dutch government's decision to freeze Nexperia's global operations under the pretext of 'national security' constitutes excessive intervention driven by geopolitical bias, rather than a fact-based risk assessment,\" Wingtech said in a deleted WeChat post, which was archived and translated by Chinese policy blog Pekingnology.It added that since it acquired Nexperia in 2019, Wingtech \"has strictly abided by the laws and regulations of all jurisdictions where it operates, maintaining transparent operations and sound governance,\" and employs \"thousands of local staff\" through R&D and manufacturing sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Britain.A spokesperson from Nexperia told CNBC that the company had no further comments, but that it \"complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,\" and remained in regular contact with relevant authorities.The Netherlands' move comes after Beijing tightened its restrictions on the export of rare earth elements and magnets Thursday, which could impact Europe's automotive industry. The move could also further strain trade relations between China and the Netherlands, following years of restrictions on Dutch company ASML's exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.In 2023, the Netherlands had also investigated Nexperia's proposed acquisition of chip firm startup Nowi, though the deal was later approved.",

Maya Levin | Afp | Getty ImagesBAGHDAD — Palestinian militant group Hamas released the first seven surviving Israeli hostages on Monday, marking the first stage of a ceasefire deal brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump.According to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces, the hostages were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza.Another transfer involving 13 surviving hostages and 28 additional captives — including 26 confirmed dead and two whose status remains uncertain — is expected to follow.As part of the agreement, Israel was also scheduled to free nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners later on the same day.Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, in an interview with CNBC Sunday, said Trump is \"serious about achieving peace\" ahead of a high-stakes summit in Egypt aimed at ending the two-year war in Gaza.Egypt is set to host more than 20 world leaders, including Trump, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday for talks expected to focus on securing a lasting peace and rebuilding the devastated enclave.Al-Sudani called the U.S. initiative \"important\" and expressed hope the truce would be \"sustainable and the beginning of a radical solution to this problem.\"watch now\"The Palestinian issue is the root of the problem in the Middle East,\" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy. \"It is time to find solutions through dialogue and respect for international institutions and agreements.\"The comments come after a two-year conflict sparked by Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, while hundreds were taken hostage. Israel's response left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead, including thousands of civilians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.Al-Sudani said Iraq supports \"every peaceful solution that leads to an end to this war,\" warning that civilians in Gaza face not only bombardment but also \"hunger, thirst, and the lack of the most basic necessities of life.\"\"Iraq is a country that has suffered the most from wars,\" he added. \"We are sensitive to all these problems that harm the humanitarian community.\"Members of Hamas military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, stand guard next to vehicles carrying released Israeli hostages on a main road in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza strip on Oct. 13, 2025. Bashar Taleb | Afp | Getty ImagesPostwar plansWhen asked about reports that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair would help coordinate Gaza's postwar transition, Al-Sudani described Blair as \"a great friend of the Iraqis\" and welcomed his involvement.\"According to the plan, there was a need for an international administration or person to assist ... in managing this transitional process,\" he said, citing the urgent need to restore services and deliver aid.watch nowOn whether Iraq might normalize ties with Israel, Al-Sudani said Baghdad's stance is defined by law and \"a principled position.\"\"Our government belongs to a parliamentary system and is bound by the laws enacted by Parliament,\" he said.Israel, he added, \"has unfortunately committed many crimes against the Palestinian people over decades. The Palestinians today deserve a better reality and a better future.\"Regional flashpointsTurning to broader regional tensions, Al-Sudani cautioned that peace efforts cannot be limited to Gaza.\"Syria certainly represents a national security issue for Iraq, and it also affects the national security of all countries in the region,\" he said.He described Israeli incursions into Syrian territory as \"incorrect and unacceptable,\" saying they violate international law and \"entrench instability in a country that everyone is keen to see recover.\"The prime minister added that remnants of the Islamic State group continue to operate in Syria, having seized weapons from the former Syrian army.\"They represent a real threat to all countries in the region,\" he said.\"Any weakening of the administration in Damascus will enable extremists to seize control and threaten the security and stability of this sensitive region.\"Palestinian youths watch as a bus bearing the emblem of the International Red Cross moves towards the eastern Gaza Strip from Khan Yunis in the south of the besieged territory on Oct. 13, 2025, ahead of the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas since the October 7 attacks two years ago.Omar Al-qattaa | Afp | Getty Images",

Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images  China's exports climbed at the fastest pace in six months in September, while imports logged their strongest gain in more than a year, even as a trade deal with the U.S. remains elusive.Exports grew 8.3% in September in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, China's customs data showed Monday, beating Reuters-polled economists' estimates for a 7.1% rise and rebounding from August's six-month low.Imports jumped 7.4% last month from a year ago, sharply beating Reuters' estimates for a 1.5% growth, marking the strongest level since April 2024, according to LSEG data.China's exports to the U.S. fell 27% in September, while imports declined 16% from a year earlier. Beijing's imports from the U.S. have dropped by double digits year on year every month since April.Beijing's trade surplus with the U.S. in the first nine months scaled back to $208.6 billion, according to the official data, compared to $25.8 billion during the same period last year.The double-digit declines in U.S.-bound shipments were largely offset by sharp increases in exports to other markets. Exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union and Africa surged 15.6%, 10.4% and 56.4%, respectively.Tensions between Beijing and Washington have flared again in recent days as both sides traded barbs and ramped up respective restrictions, threatening to erode progress made after several rounds of bilateral trade talks this year. Trade tensions flare upU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 100% levy on Chinese exports and tighter export controls on critical software. Beijing, meanwhile, expanded restrictions on rare earth exports — though some don't take effect until November — and broadened its \"unreliable entities\" blacklist to include chip consulting firm TechInsights. Authorities have also opened a fresh antitrust probe into U.S. semiconductor manufacturing giant Qualcomm.The additional tariff on U.S. imports from China, if stacked on the current average tariff of around 55%, could take the total levies to above 150%, effectively causing a trade embargo, said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at political risks advisory Teneo.\"China would likely respond tit-for-tat, and bilateral trade would slow to a trickle,\" Wildau added.Both sides have threatened to impose charges on each other's ships for docking at their own ports, set to take effect the same day on Oct. 14. Chinese levies will start at 400 yuan ($56) per ton, matching that imposed by Washington.The U.S. makes up just 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared with 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.China Customs spokesperson Lyu Daliang said at a news conference Monday that Beijing hopes the U.S. will realize that it is taking the wrong approach by raising port fees and urged Washington to return to dialogue and negotiation.Lyu added that new tariffs introduced by several countries this year have hurt businesses and disrupted the global economy, saying China remains committed to supporting multilateral trade.The reluctance of China — the world's largest importer of soybeans — to resume purchases of America's crops further dimmed hopes for a trade accord.Trump said earlier this month that he hoped to press the Chinese president at their planned meeting in late October to end the months-long moratorium on U.S. soybean purchases.Chinese soybean imports climbed 13% in September from a year earlier, according to the official data, although details on sources of these crops were not immediately available.China's exports of rare earths fell 30% from the previous month to 4,000 tons in September. Earlier this month, Beijing tightened its grip on the critical minerals by adding five new elements to its control list and increasing scrutiny for foreign firms seeking access to the materials.If fully enforced, the rules could have a major impact as they require global chip companies such as Nvidia, TSMC and Intel to obtain licenses from Chinese regulators to sell chips anywhere in the world, said Wildau.Trump-Xi meeting hangs in balanceFocus now turns to a Xi-Trump meeting at the end of the month, where the two sides can dial back the escalation, said Allan von Mehren, China economist at Danske Bank, who put the odds of such an outcome at more than 50%.China's commerce ministry said earlier Sunday that the U.S. should back off its tariff threats and urged further talks to resolve outstanding trade issues.\"Threatening with high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to get along with China,\" the Commerce Ministry said. \"If the US persists in its own course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"Customs vice minister Wang Jun said at the Monday press conference that stabilizing trade in the fourth quarter will be challenging because of the complex external environment and the high base effect of last year.China will likely be compelled to deepen ties with other markets, said Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Bank, potentially offering greater access to its trading partners. \"Nations wanting to engage with China are likely to find a more amenable export environment in the coming years,\" he added.Imports reboundThe unexpected surge in China's imports in September came after a year of weak demand caused by a prolonged housing downturn, rising job insecurity and a tapering of consumption-focused stimulus measures.Despite the improvement, other closely monitored spending data continue to show deflationary pressure in the broader economy.Total domestic tourism trips during the eight-day holiday that ended on Oct. 8 generated $113.6 billion in revenue, growing 7.6% from last year but slowing from the 8% rise during another holiday in May. The average spending per trip was also around 3% lower than in 2019 before the pandemic, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.Economists expect deflation in both the producer price index and consumer price index — due Wednesday — to persist in September, with the PPI falling 2.3% and CPI slipping 0.1% from a year earlier, according to LSEG data.China's trade surplus last month came in at $90.5 billion, up from $81.7 billion in September last year, according to the customs data.",

    "body": "Brooke Cooper was 12 years old when she thought her career in baseball was over.She had aged out of her local Little League offerings and there were no more opportunities for girls to play the sport, Cooper tells CNBC Make It. She tried playing softball next, which is traditionally seen as the female counterpart to baseball, but says she \"didn't have the same passion.\"\"I loved playing baseball,\" Cooper, now 33, says. \"I never pictured I could have a career in baseball.\"In March 2024, Cooper became the general manager of the Worcester Red Sox, a Triple-A minor league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, in Worcester, Massachusetts. She is the first female general manager in Boston Red Sox franchise history.However, Cooper says she was rejected the first time she applied for an internship with the team, then known as the Pawtucket Red Sox. That summer, the then 20-year-old waited tables and volunteered at a sports marketing firm instead, she says.From intern to general managerTwo years later, she says she applied for the merchandising internship again, this time as an MBA student at Providence College, and got the job.\"The first time, I tried to play it cool, which sounds so ridiculous because I was 20 years old and had no idea what I was doing,\" she says. \"That second time, I made it so clear how much I wanted it, how hard I would work, and I'm sure I probably had a better sense of maturity a couple of years later.\"As an intern, Cooper says she balanced business school classes with vacuuming and managing merchandise inventory in the team store.\"I was running my own small business within the larger business,\" and while the gig only paid her minimum wage, she says the experience itself was \"professionally fulfilling.\"Worcester Red SoxSoon, she began climbing the ranks, first as an assistant to the director of merchandising, and then a manager of merchandising. As the team's director of marketing and merchandising, she helped temporarily rebrand the Pawtucket Red Sox to the Hot Wieners in 2018. In 2021 she was promoted to the vice president of marketing, and the year after she became the team's assistant general manager.Dealing with imposter syndromeWhen Cooper started with the Worcester Red Sox in 2015, she says she didn't think it was possible to have a career in professional baseball. There was only one other woman working for the team's front office, and Cooper says her dream was to open a community center similar to a YMCA or Boys and Girls Club anyways.\"I say I don't have imposter syndrome, and then when I describe it, it's the definition of imposter syndrome,\" Cooper says.Looking back, she says having that imposter syndrome ended up working to her benefit because it allowed her to speak up and share her candid thoughts with managers and in meetings without being afraid of losing the job.  'I'm really, really happy to be part of an organization where this can be normalized'Cooper never felt singled out for being a woman either, she says. Her managers and team leadership have treated every promotion as a matter of fact, recognizing her as the best person for the job, she says. Becoming the Red Sox franchise's first female general manager wasn't \"a big deal\" in her organization until it was publicly announced, Cooper says.Of the 120 Minor League Baseball teams that serve as developmental programs for 30 Major League Baseball teams, 14 were led by female general managers in the 2025 season, according to the league. In 2020, Kim Ng was became the first and only female general manager to lead a Major League Baseball team. Ng left her role with the Miami Marlins in 2023.\"I'm really, really happy to be part of an organization where this can be normalized,\" Cooper says of the Worcester Red Sox. \"I find working in Minor League Baseball professionally challenging in a good way, and also very personally fulfilling … I am kind of living out my dream.\"Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "A Xiaomi electric car SU7 in a store in Yichang, Hubei Province, China on July 19, 2025.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its shares fall over 5% on Monday, following reports that the doors of one of its electric vehicles failed to open after a fiery crash in China that left one person dead.The stock slid as much as 8.7% in Hong Kong, marking its steepest drop since April, before paring losses after images and video of a burning Xiaomi SU7 sedan in Chengdu circulated on Chinese social media.Video and eyewitness accounts showed bystanders trying but failing to open the doors of the burning car to rescue an occupant. Personnel at the scene eventually used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze, local reports said.Chengdu police said the crash occurred after the SU7 collided with another sedan, killing a 31-year-old male driver who was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconXiaomi sharesXiaomi, which manufactures consumer electronics, software and electric vehicles, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The latest incident follows a fatal SU7 crash earlier this year that raised questions about the vehicle's smart driving features and sent Xiaomi's shares tumbling.The crash could also intensify scrutiny on electronic door handles, a design popularized by Tesla and now common in modern EVs. Unlike mechanical models, electronic door handles rely on sensors and electricity and may fail during a fire or power outage.China is considering a ban on such electric door handles to address safety risks linked to the feature, state-backed media reported in late September.Meanwhile, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has launched an investigation into about 174,000 Tesla Model Y vehicles after reports of door handle failures.",

    "description": "Citi is seen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 3, 2025. NYSECiti is aiming to launch a service for the custody of crypto assets in ",
    "body": "Citi is seen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 3, 2025. NYSECiti is aiming to launch a service for the custody of crypto assets in 2026, an executive at the bank told CNBC, as Wall Street giants expand their footprint in the digital currency space.Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships and innovation in the services business at Citi said the bank has been developing a crypto custody service for the last two-to-three years and is making progress.\"We have various kinds of explorations ... and we're hoping that in the next few quarters, we can come to market with a credible custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients,\" Chatterjee said.For a long time, traditional financial instutions have stayed away from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. However, President Donald Trump's administration has built a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets in the U.S. as new laws such as the GENIUS Act has looked to regulate specific areas including stablecoins. This has enabled traditional financial institutions to launch products and services to do with digital assets.In the world of crypto, custody comes in many forms including a digital asset exchange holding digital coins or the institution itself doing self-custody. Custodian services enable a bank to hold assets on behalf of its clients. This could for example, include shares in companies. There are also companies that have sprung up specifically related to crypto custody.Chatterjee said the upcoming custody service would involve Citi holding the native cryptocurrency.There are risks with all forms of custody such as cyberattacks that lead to theft of assets. Banks may offer an alternative because they are heavily regualted and have a history in the custody of assets.For Citi, Chatterjee said the lender is looking at both an in-house developed technology solution for custody as well as potential partnerships with third-parties.\"We may have certain solutions that are completely designed and built in-house that are targeted towards certain assets and certain segment of our clients, whereas may we may use a ... third party, lightweight, nimble solution for other kind of assets,\" Chatterjee told CNBC.\"So we're not currently ruling out anything.\"Not all Wall Street banks are convinced on the custody strategy. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this year that while the bank will let clients buy cryptocurrencies, it will not custody the asset.Exploration of stablecoinsU.S. banks have launched various services this year that touch on cryptocurrencies but also rely on the underlying blockchain technology.JPMorgan announced plans this year for a deposit token that is intended to serve as a digital representation of a commercial bank deposit. This would allow movement of money 24 hours a day and seven days a week.These deposit tokens are built on the Ethereum network. Citi also has its own version called Citi Token Services which allows cross-border movement of money quickly and at all times of the day.Banks are seeing blockchain as a way to move money around the world in different currencies quickly, even when traditional banking windows are closed.The next potential product they are eying are stablecoins. This type of digital coin is usually pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets such as bonds, in order to maintain its value. The biggest commercial stablecoins are Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT.Citi's Chatterjee said stablecoins could be appealing in areas of the world with a less-developed banking and payments system. As Citi's clients expand into those countries and interact with suppliers and customers there, a stablecoin-like product could be viable, he said.\"We do recognize the fact that there are these pockets in the world where you have a commercial need from our clients to be there and do business,\" Chatterjee said.The Citi executive added that the bank is still in the \"early stages of the stablecoin exploration.\" Last week, stablecoin infrastructure firm BVNK announced it had received an investment from Citi, underscoring the bank's interest in the space.Other Wall Street banks are also in the early phase of assessing stablecoins. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in July that the lender is working on launching stablecoins. JPMorgan is also in the mix.Scott Lucas, global head of markets digital assets at JPMorgan, told CNBC on Monday that the company is also \"exploring\" the digital currency.\"There's a real opportunity for us to think about how we can offer different services for our clients on the cash side, as well as responding to client demand to do things on stablecoins,\" Lucas said. \"And that strategy is still emerging, as you can understand, because it's only really been a few months since we've had some more clear regulation around what the opportunity looks like.\"",

    "body": "The Chinese national flag fluttering with the Lujiazui Financial District in the background.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's stock market rebound may be showing signs of strain as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions threaten to derail investor optimism.After months of relative calm, Washington's fresh warnings over Beijing's rare earth export controls and renewed trade tensions have revived fears of another tit-for-tat trade cycle. Chinese shares had recently rallied to a multi-year high on expectations of government stimulus and a recent inflow of foreign capital into Chinese equities. Mainland China's benchmark CSI 300, which tracks major stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rallied almost 20% since the start of the year to Oct. 9, while the Hang Seng Index surged around 33% in the same period.However, the possibility of that rally continuing was predicated on stability in geopolitical risk, especially on trade. With tariff rhetoric back at the forefront, analysts warned sentiment could quickly unravel. Both indexes lost over 2% on Monday.Markets had priced in détente ahead of a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. But those expectations have faded.\"I think it's not very likely,\" said Sean Darby, chief global strategist at Mizuho Securities, when asked if such a summit would materialize now. \"Perhaps the United States has been taken by surprise by how strong the backlash has been from China… we're going to have a much more difficult couple of weeks now, because markets had expected some sort of truce.\"If neither side were to blink, the U.S. and Chinese economies would lead the global economy into a deep recession, if not a depression.Ed YardeniPresident of Yardeni ResearchDarby added that global equities were \"perfectly priced\" and ill-prepared for a renewed trade confrontation. \"Positioning has been very aggressive, both in equities and in credit… everything that could be perfectly set for markets to do well.\" The MSCI World index, which tracks over a thousand large and mid-cap companies from 23 developed markets, rose almost 17% since the start of the year before Trump on Friday said the United States would impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China.The surprise re-emergence of tariff conflict risks grinding equities sideways, if not worse. \"Equity markets now are going to trade sideways at best, if not have a further pullback,\" he said.An already 'overbought' market?Goldman Sachs warned that the uncertainty now spans a wider range of scenarios, from renegotiation to retaliation. While the bank said the most likely outcome remains an extension of the May tariff truce, it warned the latest moves could signal China is seeking concessions of its own, and there is still a chance the two superpowers may revert to the triple-digit tariffs imposed earlier this year.\"Higher expectations along with greater threatened policy responses clearly raise the risk of a more market-negative outcome in which the U.S. and China reimpose triple-digit tariffs,\" the investment bank's strategists said in a note.And the stakes are high if neither side caves. \"If neither side were to blink, the U.S. and Chinese economies would lead the global economy into a deep recession, if not a depression,\" said Ed Yardeni, President of Yardeni Research.Additionally, the news of the latest U.S.-China spat came when Chinese equities had become \"very overbought,\" with gains concentrated in a handful of stocks like Tencent, Alibaba, NetEase, said Arthur Budaghyan, chief emerging markets and China strategist at BCA Research.\"Overbought conditions leave Chinese offshore stocks vulnerable to a pullback,\" he said.",

    "body": "As parents, it's our job to give our kids the tools they need to face struggle without breaking.I've studied over 200 parent-child relationships, and I'm a mother myself. My goal has always been to teach kids how to process hard feelings and move forward. Mentally strong kids know how to regulate their emotions, trust themselves, and rebound after setbacks. And that kind of strength is built at home, in the everyday moments between parent and child.Here are seven things to avoid if you want to raise mentally strong kids.1. Rescuing kids from every struggleKids build resilience by learning that can get through tough situations. When you rush to fix every problem, you rob your child of resilience. Let them wrestle with discomfort while staying present as their safe base.What to do: Clinical psychologist Dr. Lisa Damour says kids who regularly face age-appropriate challenges build stronger emotional regulation over time.If your child forgets their homework, let them face the natural consequence instead of driving it to school for them. Then talk afterward about what they learned and how they can plan differently next time.2. Trying to model perfectionIt's okay to lose your temper sometimes. But parents who raise mentally strong kids don't pretend like something didn't happen — or blame the child for \"making\" them react.Mental strength happens when you move through problems without destroying trust.What to do: If you snapped at them, say: \"I was stressed and took it out on you. I'm sorry.\" Your child learn will that mistakes don't end relationships, and that taking responsibility is strength.This models what experts call \"rupture and repair,\" a foundational concept in connection and emotional intelligence.3. Silencing big feelingsShutting down big feelings like anger or sadness teaches kids to fear their own emotions. Strength comes from knowing that hard feelings are manageable.This is also where kids practice social resilience. If they know anger or sadness won't destroy your bond, they're more prepared to face rejection or conflict with peers.What to do: When your child is upset, avoid saying, \"You're fine.\" Instead say: \"I know that really hurt. I'm here with you.\" Your calm presence teaches them emotions aren't emergencies.4. Prizing achievementA child who only feels valuable when they succeed will crumble under pressure. Mentally strong kids know their worth doesn't depend on grades or trophies.What to do: Studies show that perfectionism is rising in kids, which is linked to anxiety and burnout in adolescence.After a poor grade, avoid saying, \"You're smarter than this.\" Instead, say: \"I'm proud of the effort you put in. Your grade doesn't define you.\"5. Hoarding powerAuthoritarian parenting looks strong but breeds weakness. When kids never get a voice, they learn to either collapse or rebel. True strength grows when they're invited into decisions, learning that their voice matters.This is also how kids develop autonomy: They practice independence while staying connected to your guidance.What to do: Research shows that giving kids a sense of control builds motivation and reduces power struggles. Let your child choose between two chores or help decide what's for dinner. Small choices build confidence.6. Making kids feel responsible for your emotionsSome parents unknowingly expect kids to regulate their stress by comforting them. This emotional role reversal is damaging.What to do: Instead of saying, \"You're making me sad,\" try: \"I'm feeling overwhelmed. I need a moment to calm down.\" It's not your child's job to manage your nervous system.7. Glorifying burnoutChildren raised to glorify productivity grow into burned-out adults. Show them that strength includes knowing when to pause, recharge, and value themselves beyond constant output.When you demonstrate rest, you're teaching body awareness: how to recognize stress signals and respond before burnout.What to do: Say, \"I'm going to rest for 20 minutes. Taking care of myself helps me feel better.\"Mental strength is all about helping kids face hard things, feel their feelings, take ownership, and rest — while knowing they're deeply loved for who they are.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of FOUNDATIONS, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

    "body": "watch nowShares of Bloom Energy surged Monday after striking a deal with Brookfield to deploy fuel cells for artificial intelligence data centers. Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom Energy's technology, the first investment in its strategy to support big AI data centers with power and computing infrastructure. Brookfield and Bloom are collaborating to design and build what they are calling \"AI factories\" around the the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year. Shares of Bloom Energy were up more than 30% in early trading. Bloom's fuel cells provide onsite power that can be deployed quickly because they do not rely on a connection to the electric grid. Bloom has already deployed hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities like American Electric Power and data centers developers like Equinix and Oracle, according to the company. The AI industry's data center plans are growing in scale. Nvidia and OpenAI, for example, recently announced a partnership that aims to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, equivalent to the power consumed by New York City on some days during the summer. But AI companies' plans are butting up against an ageing U.S. electric grid that is often slow to deploy additional power capacity. Data centers also threatening to exacerbate rising electricity prices for consumers. Deploying power solutions \"behind-the-meter,\" or off the grid, \"are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,\" said Brookfield's global head of AI infrastructure Sikander Rashid. \"AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,\" Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar said. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week that the AI industry will need to build power off the electric to meet demand quickly and protect consumers from rising electricity prices. \"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" Huang told CNBC on Oct. 8.

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase on Monday said it is launching a decade-long plan to help finance and take direct stakes in companies it considers crucial to U.S. interests.The bank said in a statement it would invest up to $10 billion into companies in four areas: defense and aerospace, \"frontier\" technologies including AI and quantum computing, energy technology including batteries, and supply chain and advanced manufacturing.The money is part of a broader effort, dubbed the Security and Resiliency Initiative, in which JPMorgan said it will finance or facilitate $1.5 trillion in funding for companies it identifies as crucial. It said the total amount is 50% more than a previous plan.\"It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the release.As the biggest American bank by assets and a Wall Street juggernaut, JPMorgan was already raising funds and lending money to companies in those industries. But the move helps organize the company's activities around national interests at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.On Friday, markets tumbled as President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports after the major U.S. trading partner tightened export controls on rare earths.In the release, Dimon said that the U.S. needs to \"remove obstacles\" including excessive regulations, \"bureaucratic delay\" and \"partisan gridlock.\"JPMorgan said that within the four major areas, there were 27 specific industries it would look to support with advice, financing and investments. That includes areas as diverse as nanomaterials, autonomous robots, spacecraft and space launches, and nuclear and solar power.\"Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy,\" Dimon said. \"This new initiative includes efforts like ensuring reliable access to life-saving medicines and critical minerals, defending our nation, building energy systems to meet AI-driven demand and advancing technologies like semiconductors and data centers.\"The bank said it would hire an unspecified numbers of bankers and create an external advisory council to support its initiative.This story is developing.

    "body": "Last year, while researching for my book \"Healthy to 100: How Strong Social Ties Lead to Long Lives,\" I visited five of the world's healthiest countries — Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Spain — to see how they keep older adults active, engaged, purposeful, and healthy.I picked these countries because they have some of the longest healthy life expectancies in the world (in some cases, a decade longer than the U.S.). And none of them the most ideal environments for aging: Singapore is hot, crowded, and has a notoriously competitive work environment, for instance. In Spain, obesity and smoking rates are significant. If these countries can succeed, so can we.At a community development center in Kanazawa, Japan, older adults teach, volunteer, run the restaurant, or just hang out with young people and those with Down syndrome. In Korea, lifelong learning is written into the Constitution. Singapore is building a whole \"health district.\" Italy taps into the wisdom and energy of seniors through volunteering.After seeing how these countries are rewriting the rules on aging, I'm doing five things to live a longer, happier life.1. I'll plan for the next 20 years, like I did the last 20In other countries, definitions of \"old age\" are fluid, tied to individual circumstances rather than arbitrary dates. At 62, I can easily have another 20 or more years of good health, and unlike many older adults, I am going to plan them with the same seriousness of purpose I did the last 20.   I spent the first big chunk of my career managing people who create content. It was only in my 50s that I realized I was much happier telling the stories myself. In the last decade, I've written three books, hosted my own podcast, launched two weekly newsletters, and started a video channel on Instagram called GrandPeople. While our society often pushes us to make big, intentional career and life plans in our 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s, we don't typically expect as much from people over the age of 60. But as I look ahead, I'm excited to continue honing and developing my craft. Because there's no reason the next 20 years can't be as meaningful and purposeful as the last. 2. I won't retire anytime soon, but I will rethink how I workJapan has the highest percentage of older workers in the world, and many of them aren't working just for the money. They do it for purpose, connection, and health. Most work part-time, on flexible schedules, or in job shares.While in Japan, I met older adults working on candy assembly lines, managing books for a machine tool company, running parking lots, driving taxis, and guiding tours.The lesson they embodied stuck with me. As I think about my own future, I plan to continue working, but on my terms. I'll keep writing books and telling stories. But maybe I won't commit to putting out two newsletters a week forever. And that's okay. Instead of working full-steam or retiring completely, I can find a middle ground. The goal is to keep working in a way that fits the life I want to lead.3. I'll spend time with people of all agesAmericans don't tend to think of intergenerational connection as a public health strategy, but people in the countries I visited see how important this is. Studies all over the world have shown the benefits of intergenerational relationships, such as increased happiness, a better sense of well-being, and improved physical and mental health.Even in the U.S., which has been described as one of the most age-segregated societies in the world, there are opportunities for intergenerational collaboration: at work, in neighborhoods, in volunteer settings, in families. I'll proactively find places and activities that connect me with younger generations, and choose to foster my friendships with people of all ages. Down the line, I'd consider moving into a place like Mirabella at Arizona State University or Gorham House in Maine, which combines a nursing home with a preschool. 4. I'll prioritize socializing over scrollingTime spent with friends has dropped precipitously in the U.S., while time spent with technology has skyrocketed. It doesn't have to be that way. I saw for myself how Italians spend more time at meals and with family and less time online. This couldn't be more important. A decades-long Harvard study tells us that positive relationships are key to living a longer, happier, healthier life — more crucial even than career achievement, money, exercise, or a healthy diet.My baby steps include being more intentional about family meals without phones and trying to cut back on the obsessive scrolling of the news and Instagram that interferes with human conversation.  5. I'll never stop learningResearch has demonstrated that learning supports healthy aging. Many states provide free or low-cost education opportunities to older adults, and I plan to take advantage of them. As I think ahead to my next book project, I might enroll in a writing seminar at an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute designed to serve older learners. Each one is associated with a university — the closest to me is at American University — and offers a wide range of classes. Whatever class I take or learning I do, it will be in person. Because interacting face-to-face maximizes social connection and healthy longevity. Ken Stern is a nationally recognized expert on longevity and aging. He is the founder of the Longevity Project and hosts the popular \"Century Lives\" podcast from the Stanford Center on Longevity. His most recent book is Healthy to 100: How Strong Social Ties Lead to Long Lives.\" He is also the former CEO of NPR.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "Oil pumpjacks operate at Daqing Oilfield at sunset on November 18, 2024 in Daqing, Heilongjiang Province of China.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesEnergy supermajors are being forced to confront some tough choices in a weaker crude price environment, with generous shareholder payouts expected to come under serious pressure over the coming months.U.S. and European oil majors, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and BP, have moved to cut jobs and reduce costs of late, as they look to tighten their belts amid an industry downturn.It reflects a stark change in mood from just a few years ago.In 2022, the West's five biggest oil companies raked in combined profits of nearly $200 billion when fossil fuel prices soared following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Flush with cash, the likes of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies sought to use what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres described as their \"monster profits\" to reward shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks.Indeed, the amount of cash returns as a percentage of cash flow from operations (CFFO) has climbed to as much as 50% for several energy companies in recent quarters, according to Maurizio Carulli, global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot.It's better to cut buybacks than dividends: For investors, buybacks are gravy, but dividends are the meat.Clark Williams-DerryEnergy finance analyst at IEEFAIn today's environment of weaker crude prices, however, Carulli said this policy risks taking on new levels of debt beyond what could be considered a \"healthy\" balance sheet.BP and, more recently, TotalEnergies have announced plans to take steps to reduce shareholder returns.BP in April lowered its share buyback to $750 million, down from $1.75 billion in the prior quarter, after reporting first-quarter profit which fell short of market expectations. TotalEnergies, for its part, said late last month that it had decided to adjust the pace of its share buybacks \"in order to face economic and geopolitical uncertainties and to retain room to maneuver.\"Quilter Cheviot's Carulli described these moves as a \"sensible change in direction,\" noting that other oil majors will likely follow suit.Thomas Watters, managing director and sector lead for oil and gas at S&P Global Ratings, echoed this sentiment.Oil refinery at sunrise: an aerial view of industrial power and energy production.Chunyip Wong | E+ | Getty Images\"Oil companies are under pressure as crude prices soften, with the potential for prices to fall into the $50 range next year as OPEC continues to release surplus capacity and global inventories build,\" Watters told CNBC by email.\"Faced with the challenge of sustaining these returns in a lower-price environment, many will look to reduce costs and capital spending where they can,\" he added.Dividend cuts 'would send shivers through Wall Street'Clark Williams-Derry, energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a non-profit organization, said trimming the share buybacks is likely Big Oil's easiest option.\"Over the past few years, oil companies have used buybacks to return cash to investors and prop up share prices. And it's better to cut buybacks than dividends: For investors, buybacks are gravy, but dividends are the meat,\" Williams-Derry told CNBC by email.\"A cut in a dividend would send shivers through Wall Street,\" Williams-Derry said.Saudi Arabia's state oil producer Saudi Aramco did just that earlier in the year, slashing the world's biggest dividend amid an uncertain outlook for oil prices.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude futures year-to-date.IEEFA's Williams-Derry linked the move to a steady weakening of the Saudi Aramco's share price through most of this year, noting that other private oil majors will want to avoid the same fate.Ultimately, Williams-Derry said oil majors likely have three questions to consider now that the Ukraine boom in oil prices has faded.\"Do they keep taking on new debt to fund their shareholder payouts? Do they slash buybacks, eliminating one of the major factors propping up share prices? Or do they cut back on drilling, signaling weaker production in the future?\" Williams-Derry said.\"There are risks to each choice, and no matter what they choose they're bound to make some investors unhappy,\" he added.Big Oil outlookFor some, Big Oil's current state of play is not nearly as bad as it might have been.\"It perhaps hasn't been as gloomy as people expected earlier in the year, because you've had this narrative, really since the announcement of Trump's tariffs back in April, that the oil market was meant to go into a glut and a period of oversupply later in the year,\" Peter Low, co-head of energy research at Rothschild & Co Redburn, told CNBC by video call.\"What's actually surprised people is how resilient oil prices have been because they have stayed in that $65 to $70 a barrel range, more or less,\" he added.Read moreOil prices have since slipped below this range.International benchmark Brent crude futures with December expiry traded 1.4% higher at $63.61 per barrel on Monday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with November expiry rose 1.4% to trade at $59.77.\"The question, probably less for 3Q and perhaps more for 4Q, is really to what extent distributions and buybacks in particular might need to be to cut to reflect a weaker commodity price environment,\" Low said.\"I think given that 3Q was OK, they will probably wait to see what happens in the coming weeks and months and 4Q would be a more natural point for them to revisit shareholder distributions,\" he added.TotalEnergies and Britain's Shell are both scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 30, with Exxon Mobil and Chevron set to follow suit on Oct. 31. BP is poised to report its quarterly results on Nov. 4.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an announcement about lowering U.S. drug prices, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 10, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said his administration has \"identified funds\" to pay troops next week despite the federal government shutdown.Trump said in a post on Truth Social: \"I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether all or some members of the U.S. military would be paid and which funds the government will use to pay them. A Pentagon official told Reuters that about $8 billion in research & development funds would be used to pay the troops if the shutdown continues.Paychecks would be due for 1.3 million active members of the U.S. military on Oct. 15, raising the potential political costs of the impasse, some economists have said.\"We believe the military pay date on Oct. 15 could be an important forcing event for a compromise to restore funding and expect the shutdown to end by mid-October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Ronnie Walker and Alec Phillips said in a client note.The Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal workers across a range of agencies on Friday, the 10th day of the government shutdown.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that the number of federal workers who will be laid off will \"be a lot.\"\"It'll be Democrat-oriented,\" Trump said, reiterating his promise to target programs he believes are favored by Democratic officials. The uncertainty over which federal workers will be paid — and which will be laid off or potentially fired — has heightened anxiety among workers.Members of the aviation industry have raised concerns about added strains on already thinly staffed air traffic controllers across the country.Next week, they will receive their first partial paycheck and are set to miss a full paycheck on Oct. 28 if the funding impasse isn't resolved, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers' union, stated on Friday.The union said it plans to start informational leafleting on Tuesday at New York's LaGuardia Airport about the effects of the shutdown on controllers. Similar events are scheduled at other airports in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia.\"Participating air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals plan to engage with travelers to explain how the government shutdown introduces unnecessary risk to the National Airspace System (NAS) and is detrimental to efficiency,\" the union said.— CNBC's Jeff Cox and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

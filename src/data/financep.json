    "body": "<div><p>President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> on Thursday said Democrats have given him an \"unprecedented opportunity\" to slash federal agencies, signaling plans to harm his political opponents during the two-day-old <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">government shutdown</a> while blaming them for causing it.</p><p>Trump's warning came a day after his administration froze about $18 billion for two major <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/trump-new-york-funding-infrastructure-vought.html\">infrastructure projects in New York City</a> and canceled roughly $8 billion more for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/trump-green-new-deal-funding-states-vought.html\">climate-related projects</a> in Democratic-leaning states.</p><p>Both of the funding halts were first announced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-omb.html\">Russell Vought</a>, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, not by the departments that have oversight over the projects.</p><p>Trump said he will soon meet with Vought \"to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut.\"</p><p>The two men will also weigh \"whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,\" Trump wrote <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115304455138824245\" target=\"_blank\">on Truth Social</a>.</p><p>\"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,\" he added.</p><p>Vought was a key author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for massively reforming the U.S. government.</p><p>Trump repeatedly disavowed Project 2025 while running for president, saying he and his campaign had \"nothing to do with it.\"</p><p>But in Thursday's post, Trump touted Vought as \"he of PROJECT 2025 Fame.\"</p><p>It was unclear when Trump and Vought were scheduled to meet. The White House responded to a request for details about the meeting with an automated message blaming Democrats for the shutdown and warning that its correspondence with the press may be delayed as a result.</p><p>The federal shutdown began Wednesday after a divided Congress could not pass a bill to keep the government fully funded past the fiscal year that ended Tuesday.</p><p>Republicans, who hold the White House and slim majorities in the House and Senate, wanted to pass a stopgap bill to maintain funding at current levels until late November. </p><p>Democrats, whose support is needed to overcome the 60-vote Senate filibuster, want any short-term funding to include an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits, which are due to lapse at year's end. The enhanced subsidies reduce the costs of health insurance premiums for a wider swath of Affordable Care Act enrollees.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that Democrats are negotiating like \"terrorists.\" </p><p>Bessent also said he \"can guarantee there's not going to be an agreement\" with regard to the dispute over the ACA credits.</p><p>The Trump administration, in a memo released by Vought's OMB, had warned federal agencies last week to prepare for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-omb.html\">mass firings</a> in the event of a shutdown.</p><p>Trump, asked about that memo, said, \"there could be firings and that's their fault.\"</p><p>\"We could cut projects that they wanted, favorite projects, and they'd be permanently cut,\" he said in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN.</p><p>After the funding lapse began, top White House officials — including Vought and Vice President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jd-vance-us-vice-president/\">JD Vance</a> — said those firings would begin within days.</p><p>Past government shutdowns have cause hundreds of thousands of federal workers to be furloughed, meaning placed on unpaid leave. But they generally are guaranteed backpay upon their return once the government reopens.</p><p>Vance, asked Wednesday why the Trump administration is gearing up to fire workers instead of merely furlough them, said, \"We haven't made any final decisions about what we're going to do with certain workers.\"</p><p>\"What we're saying is that we might have to take extraordinary steps, especially the longer this goes on,\" he said.</p><p><strong>This is breaking news.

Led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/29/shutdown-democrats-republicans-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats have been pushing</a> for an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of about $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts included in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.</p><p>In turn, Trump and Vice President J.D Vance have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">threatened permanent job cuts</a>. Last week, the Office of Management and Budget sent a memo directing federal agencies to prepare layoff plans for programs \"not consistent with the president's priorities\" if funding lapses, according to the memo <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-the-full-memo-directing-federal-agencies-to-weigh-mass-layoffs-if-the-government-shuts-down\" target=\"_blank\">published by PBS</a>.</p><p>Labor unions have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/labor-unions-sue-omb-opm-00589170\" target=\"_blank\">already sued</a> over the move, arguing it violates federal law.</p></div><h2><a></a>What a shutdown means and who is affected</h2><div><p>Each year, Congress must approve funding for the government's new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. A shutdown occurs when lawmakers miss that deadline. The last time it happened was a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\" target=\"_blank\">34-day shutdown in 2018</a>, during Trump's first term.</p><p>In a shutdown, agencies pause many operations and split workers into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Excepted employees</strong> who must keep working without pay, commonly in roles tied to safety and national security.</li><li><strong>Non-excepted employees</strong> who are placed on unpaid leave and told not to report to work.</li></ul><p>Federal employees are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends, but <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/government-shutdown-who-gets-paid\" target=\"_blank\">contractors are not</a>.</p><p>The shutdown's effects will be most visible in the government's largest agencies. At the Department of Homeland Security, more than 250,000 employees are required to keep working without pay, including border patrol officers and TSA agents, according to its contingency plan. </p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services expects to furlough about 32,460 workers, or 41% of its staff,<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-shutdown-furlough-41-health-agency-workers-2025-09-29/\" target=\"_blank\"> Reuters reports</a>. And at the FAA, more than 11,000 employees are being sent home while about 13,000 air traffic controllers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/faa-would-furlough-11000-employees-us-government-shutdown-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">continue working without pay</a>.</p><p>Most social programs will continue because they're funded outside the annual budget process. Social Security and Medicare benefits will still go out, the Postal Service will keep running and veterans' health care and disability payments will continue. SNAP food assistance is not expected to be affected immediately, though a prolonged shutdown could strain USDA's reserves,<a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/government-shutdown-snap-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\"> AARP</a> reports.</p></div><h2><a></a>Guidance for federal workers</h2><div><p>Shutdowns are a considerable disruption, especially for federal employees whose pay status can be unclear. To help them, the Office of Personnel Management maintains the government-wide<a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutdown guidance</a> that applies to all federal employees.</p><p>Federal agencies have also posted contingency plans that outline who is furloughed, who must keep working without pay and the procedures employees are expected to follow while operations are scaled back. Below is guidance from some of the agencies with the most employees affected:</p><ul><li>Department of Defense <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/27/2003809363/-1/-1/1/CONTINGENCY-PLAN-GUIDANCE-FOR-CONTINUATION-OF-OPERATIONS-IN-THE-ABSENCE-OF-APPROPRIATIONS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Department of Veterans Affairs <a href=\"https://department.va.gov/contingency-planning/\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/2025_0929_dhs_procedures_related_to_a_lapse_in_appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown procedures</a></li><li>Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/media/1377216/dl\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Health and Human Services<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> contingency staffing plan</a></li><li>Department of Transportation <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/lapse\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown guidance</a></li><li>State Department<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DOS-Lapse-Guidance-updated-29-September-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> guidance</a></li></ul><p>For contract workers wondering if they'll get paid, the National Law Review <a href=\"https://natlawreview.com/article/how-government-contractors-should-prepare-and-deal-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">offers advice</a> on confirming contract status and possible recourse on compensation.</p><p>Beyond that, out-of-work federal workers and contractors might qualify for <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/unemployment-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">state unemployment insurance</a>.

Examples including Nicolaus Copernicus who theorized the sun was at the center of the universe and other planets move round it.</p><p>Wolf explained a couple of issues with chatbots right now. The first is that these products like ChatGPT and others often agree or align with the person prompting it. Think back to if you've asked a chatbot a prompt and it will tell you how interesting or great that question is.</p><p>The second is that the models underpinning these chatbots are designed to \"predict the most likely next token\" or \"word\" in a sentence.</p><p>However, he noted two key traits of scientists. The first is that scientists who make major breakthroughs are often contrarian and question what others are saying.</p><p>\"The scientist is not trying to predict the most likely next word. He's trying to predict this very novel thing that's actually surprisingly unlikely, but actually is true,\" Wolf said.</p><p>The Hugging Face co-founder has been thinking about this topic for the last few months. His interest was sparked after he read an essay penned by Anthropic's Amodei, who posited that \"AI-enabled biology and medicine will allow us to compress the progress that human biologists would have achieved over the next 50-100 years into 5-10 years.\"</p><p>That got Wolf thinking about the state of AI and how this won't be possible, in his view, with the current crop of models.</p><p>Wolf said that these chatbots and tools will likely be used as a sort of \"co-pilot for a scientist\" where they are used for research to help the human generate new ideas.</p><p>To some extent, this has been happening already. Google DeepMind's AlphaFold product has helped to analyze protein structures which the company has promised could aid scientists in discovering new drugs.</p><p>But there are some new startups that are hoping to take AI one step further into being able to make scientific breakthroughs, including Lila Sciences and FutureHouse.</p></div></div>"

The ministry also proposed a new 5% gambling tax.</p><p>The proposed tax hikes come as economic growth is expected to stutter to<a href=\"http://government.ru/rugovclassifier/60/events/\" target=\"_blank\"> 1.3% in 2026</a>, the government said — a far cry from <a href=\"https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/109666/\" target=\"_blank\">the 4.1% expansion recorded in 2024</a> and a sharp drop from the previous projections for 2.5% growth this year and 2.4% next year.</p><p>The preliminary budget — which needs to be approved by the Russian parliament, the State Duma — suggested that defense spending would fall slightly in 2026, to 13 trillion rubles, down from a post-soviet record of 13.5 trillion rubles this year, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-defence-spending-set-fall-slightly-2026-draft-budget-shows-2025-09-29/\" target=\"_blank\">according to preliminary Finance Ministry figures obtained by Reuters last week.</a></p></div><h2><a></a>Russian public on the hook</h2><div><p>The Russian public is effectively being told to pay for the war against Ukraine, analysts said of the budget proposals, warning that the country was entering a low-growth era.</p><p>\"As economic growth stalls and revenues decline, Moscow is no longer able to pump up the fiscal stimulus that fueled earlier wartime expansion, instead embracing austerity measures that threaten to further strangle the civilian economy,\" Alexander Kolyandr, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, noted <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/the-kremlin-to-russian-consumers-pay-for-our-war/\" target=\"_blank\">in analysis</a> this week.</p><p>\"Moscow's financial strategy for the fifth year of war is unmistakable ... the Kremlin will attempt to muddle through without major expenditure increases, instead passing the war's costs to  the whole of society,\" he said.</p></div><div><p>A Moscow shopping mall pictured earlier this year. </p><p>Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The new budget confirms that \"the Russian public is paying for the war,\" Alexandra Prokopenko, fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in analysis Wednesday.</p><p>Noting that the 2026 budget looks \"more and more like a compromise between the war camp and economists,\" she said \"footing the bill will be the Russian people, who face further tax hikes.\"</p><p>She cautioned that the nominal reduction in defense spending in 2026 \"is certainly not a sign that the Kremlin plans to end its war against Ukraine.\"</p><p>\"Budget spending in the national defense category may be declining from 13.4 trillion rubles this year to 12.6 trillion rubles in 2026 (a decrease of 4.2%), but spending in an adjacent category — national security and law enforcement— is increasing from 3.46 trillion to 3.91 trillion rubles: a 13% increase,\" Prokopenko noted.</p></div><h2><a></a>Inflation eyed</h2><div><p>Russia's war against Ukraine, which began in 2022, prompted a sea change in the country's economy, with rampant government spending on defense and the military-industrial complex fueling both economic growth but also inflation, which was further exacerbated by sanctions, labor shortages and higher wage demand, and supply constraints.</p><p>Price rises, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/25/russias-inflation-is-so-bad-that-people-are-stealing-butter.html\">particularly of basic goods like butter and meat</a>, have been hard on Russian consumers. The country's central bank has looked to tame inflation with high interest rates, increasing borrowing costs for businesses and acting, paradoxically, as another brake on economic growth. The latest data showed inflation stood at 8.1% in August, while the central bank's benchmark interest rate was at 17%.</p></div><div><p>A customer with a cart chooses cheese at the Okey supermarket in St. Petersburg. </p><p>Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Russia's finance minister, Anton Siluanov, was grilled by state media outfit Tass this week on <a href=\"https://minfin.gov.ru/ru/press-center?id_4=39943\" target=\"_blank\">the rationale behind tax rises on consumers and entrepreneurs</a>. He told the agency that they were preferable to increased borrowing, which would fuel inflation.</p><p>\"An uncontrolled increase in public debt would lead to accelerated inflation and, consequently, an increase in the key rate. Conversely, the decision to balance the budget through tax increases gives the Central Bank room to ease monetary policy. The key rate is crucial for investment growth and economic growth,\" he told Tass.</p></div><div><p>Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov (seen here with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019) reportedly told Russian newspaper Vedomosti that Moscow will continue to service external debts in rubles, but foreign Eurobond holders will need to open ruble and hard currency accounts with Russian banks in order to receive payments.</p><p>Mikhail Svetlov | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Asked if the defense budget would increase, Siluanov suggested that national security would become more of a focus for the government with defense and security expenditures set to take into account \"additional tasks and challenges.\"</p><p>These, he suggested, included \"other functional areas related less to military defense than to ensuring the security of the country and its citizens as a whole.\"</p><p>This included the development of counter-drone systems, the protection of critical infrastructure and border areas, enhanced transport security, and cybersecurity, Siluanov said. \"Overall spending in 2026 remains at a level comparable to 2025, but is higher than the 2024 level,\" he noted.</p><p><em>Correction: Alexander Kolyandr is a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.

Effective drone defence must combine several countermeasures, with cannon-based drone defence taking centre stage in our view, as this is the only cost-effective measure,\" they added.</p><p>It is within this context that a cannon-based drone defense system is the \"ideal means\" of defending against drones at close range in terms of cost-benefit, efficiency and reliability, the Rheinmetall spokesperson said.</p></div><div><p>A Luna NG VTOL reconnaissance drone is seen at the new Rheinmetall artillery munitions factory during its inauguration on August 27, 2025 in Unterluess, Germany.</p><p>Morris Macmatzen | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>As EU leaders convened on Wednesday, Denmark's defense ministry said a number of European nations had contributed anti-drone equipment, expertise and personnel to help strengthen the country's defense against drones this week.</p><p>Ukraine, an expert in drone warfare after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/russian-forces-invade-ukraine.html\">three years of war with Russia</a>, also lent Denmark its anti-drone expertise.</p></div><h2><a></a>Three areas of concern</h2><div><p>It's not just established defense giants closely monitoring the prospect of a drone wall on Europe's eastern flank.</p><p>Jens Holzapfel, business director at Swedish defense drone company Nordic Air Defense (NAD), also welcomed what he described as a \"bold and ambitious\" plan.</p><p>\"I think it is very important and we certainly welcome that initiative because every investment in drone defense is much needed and, of course, it is very pleasant to see that European leaders are uniting around a common perception of the threat,\" Holzapfel told CNBC by video call.</p></div><div><p>Ukrainian soldiers prepare the UAV 'Evanger' for launch on September 24, 2025 in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine.

NAD's Holzapfel cited the name itself as a potential problem, saying the idea of a drone wall risks oversimplifying the reality.</p><p>\"This will be a network of radars, other sensors and countermeasures that need to be sort of interoperable and integrated. So, it is not an easy trick to pull off,\" Holzapfel said.</p><p>He stressed that the EU should also be cognizant to the risk of drones being launched from within its territory, saying nation state attackers or even non-state actors might have been inspired by Ukraine's <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-spiderweb-drone-attack-russia-kyiv-moscow-osint-satellite-rcna211381\" target=\"_blank\">notorious \"Spiderweb\" drone attack</a> on strategic targets deep within Russia earlier this year.</p><p>\"My concern is that the establishment of the drone wall will drown in the regular European bureaucracy and haggling between member states over who's calling the shots, and which companies will be involved, and so forth,\" Holzapfel said.</p><p>\"It's last minute to establish a drone wall and I'm worried that we will not be able to pull this off at the speed that is required,\" he added.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"

    "body": "Dustin Muskovitz, co-founder and chairman at Asana.Stefanie Keenan | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeta's co-founder Dustin Moskovitz opened up about the pains of leadership and admitted that 13 years of being a CEO was \"exhausting.\"Moskovitz, one of the original founders of Meta, formerly Facebook, co-founded the social platform in 2004 alongside Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum.After leaving Facebook in 2008, he retained a stake of just over 8%, making him a billionaire with a net worth of $12 billion, according to the most recent data from Forbes. He went on to become a co-founder and CEO of work management software platform Asana the same year.Moskovitz announced his departure as Asana's CEO earlier this year and has transitioned into the role of chairman, while retaining an ownership of 53% of the company's outstanding shares between Class A and Class B holdings. The billionaire recently opened up about what it was like to be a CEO at Asana, while also having an introverted personality, on an episode of the Stratechery podcast by Ben Thompson, released on Monday.\"I don't like to manage teams, and it wasn't my intention when we started Asana,\" Moskovitz said during the episode.\"I'd intended to be more of a independent or head of engineering or something again. Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting.\"He added: \"I'm an introvert, I had to just kind of put on this face day after day and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,' and then the world just kept getting more chaotic — the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff, it made it just a lot less of the company building, being a CEO is a lot more reacting to problems and doing this sort of thing.\"Many famous leaders are introvertsVarious notable business leaders have described themselves as being introverts, from Meta's Zuckerberg, to Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett.Susan Cain, author of \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\" said introverts are often passed over for leadership positions and thrive more in quieter and less stimulating environments.She said introverts have some hidden traits that can make them well suited for leadership positions, including taking fewer risks, being more creative, and being better at problem solving.Cain said that introverted leaders can be \"slow\" and \"circumspect\" when making decisions which helps them to avoid impulsive or reckless moves.They also tend to seek out solitude more which is \"a real catalyst to creativity,\" according to Cain.\"This two-tier structure of how we view personality leads to a colossal waste of talent, and of energy and of happiness,\" Cain said. \"We need to be adopting much more of a yin and yang approach of balance between the two styles.\"",

    "body": "People who consistently achieve their goals have a few key traits in common, according to psychologist Angela Duckworth.Duckworth, a University of Pennsylvania professor and bestselling author, has spent more than 15 years studying the concept of \"grit,\" or what pushes someone to stay dedicated to — and eventually meet — their long-term goals. Many people with high levels of grit share these four qualities, she said on an October 13 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\":They pursue projects they're genuinely interested in.They practice the skills they need for those projects diligently and deliberately.They have a strong sense of purpose, meaning that they feel like they're helping other people — not just themselves.They genuinely hope that their efforts will help them improve in the future.\"When you look at people who are great at what they do ... Their mind comes to this subject and wants to stay there,\" said Duckworth, adding: \"I don't believe you can grow passion without the seed of interest.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterIf you don't know exactly what you're passionate about or genuinely interested in, take note when the people around you say things like, \"By the way, you spend a lot of time thinking about X, Y and Z,\" said Duckworth. You may not recognize what you're interested in until you actually try something new, so do that, she advised.\"Don't think it, just do it. Stop writing in your journal. Stop asking yourself questions,\" Duckworth said. \"Literally go out and do something. Interests are like food. You've got to taste it to know whether you like it or not.\"Duckworth also highlighted the difference between low-quality practice and actual dedication to improving, using herself as an example. An avid runner, Duckworth went out running regularly, and wondered why she wasn't improving as much as she expected, she said.In response, her late mentor — psychologist Anders Ericsson — asked her some insightful questions, she said: Did she have a specific goal? Was she practicing with complete effort and concentration? Did she seek feedback on areas of improvement?\"Never,\" Duckworth said. \"I was doing low-quality practice.\"The third trait, purpose, is an oft-studied one — and feeling like you have a responsibility to other people can help keep you accountable while trying to meet a long-term goal, Robbins noted. Just be careful: Focusing too much on your big-picture purpose can make you undervalue the path or process it took to get there, author and physician Jordan Grumet wrote for CNBC Make It in April.Focusing on the process of achieving your goal, rather than the outcome, can help you live a more fulfilled life, Grumet noted: \"Unlike big audacious goals that take years or even decades to achieve, the small, more personal types of purpose are ongoing projects that are enjoyable regardless of the results.\"If you struggle with discouragement at any point, you can try a tactic that Duckworth uses herself, she said.\"I take my pen out and I put a to-do list together that is ridiculously simple, like 'Open [a] Google Doc.' Then I open the Google Doc and check it off. Small win,\" said Duckworth. \"If you break down these things that are feeling discouraging to you, you should just think to yourself, 'Too big.' Not that it's impossible.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "One in seven people have never spoken to their relatives about their family's health history, according to a recent global study from Bupa, a health insurance company. The survey polled 8,000 adults and 169 health professionals from the UK, Australia, Spain and more.Of the respondents, 30% said having a conversation about family health history had never crossed their minds and 20% said their families don't talk about health openly. \"Even though it's one in seven people, that person is connected to a family who hasn't had those conversations. So in some ways, it's kind of like one in seven families,\" says Sherry Pagoto, a licensed clinical psychologist who was involved in the study.About four in five (79%) of healthcare professionals polled agree that \"more lives could be saved if patients had better knowledge of their family health history,\" according to the study.With the knowledge of genetic health risks, doctors can make informed decisions like screening patients for specific conditions that run in their family, Pagoto says. But patients may not understand the importance of having those conversations or they may be uncomfortable to learn about their health histories, she adds.Another issue is \"not really knowing how to bring it up,\" says Pagoto who is also a professor in the department of Allied Health Sciences at the University of Connecticut. Some people may struggle with how to approach the topic and what to do with the information once they have it.Here are Pagoto's tips for starting the conversation about your genetic health risks with your family, and what she suggests for next steps.6 tips for talking to your family about genetic health risksBelieve that loved ones may be open to the conversation: \"People would be surprised at how open they may find family members to be of talking about themselves,\" Pagoto says. \"Particularly elderly family members.\"Check in with them about how they're currently feeling: Start with what's comfortable by asking, \"How are you feeling today?\" she suggests. You can ask about their most recent check-ups and what they discussed with their doctor.Introduce the topic of your family's health history: You can start the conversation with something like, \"I'd love to know more about any health conditions that you've had because those could run in the family,\" she suggests. Or you can ask what caused the death of specific family members to get more context.Take notes and document the information after: Approach this conversation \"almost like you're constructing this family tree, but of health conditions,\" Pagoto says. Having all of the information in one place makes it easy for you to share it with your doctor or with your siblings or your own children.Get other family members on board: If you speak to your maternal grandmother about that side of your family, maybe you can ask your siblings to speak to your paternal side, she notes. Delegating tasks will make it easier for you to get the knowledge you all need.Share what you learn with the right people: Once you know about your genetic health risks, it's important to share what you've learned with your doctor and your family members. Ask your doctor questions like \"Are there any tests or screenings that we should do for me right now?\" or \"What recommendations do you have for [prevention]?\"Remember that what you learn about your family's health history is only context, and not a prediction of what you can expect in your own future, Pagoto says. \"Your genes are not your fate. They're one part of an equation. Your lifestyle and your health care is a big part of that equation,\" she explains.\"It might actually make you feel more motivated to do these healthy lifestyle behaviors that we sometimes feel like 'I'm not motivated for that' or 'I don't have time for that'. It really pops it up on the top of your priority list.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "One quality separates the most successful business owners from all others, according to billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud: They work really, really hard.In that vein, the 61-year-old founder and former chairman of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain doesn't believe in work-life balance, he said in a TikTok video posted by The School of Hardknocks on Oct. 9. \"Work-life balance [for entrepreneurs] is the biggest line of bulls--- that's ever been created,\" he said. \"There's no such thing as work-life balance. When you're going to squeeze lemonade out of horses---, you've got to squeeze really, really hard ... To create something from nothing, there is no such thing.\"Liautaud speaks from experience: Despite graduating second-to-last in his high school class, he created a billion-dollar brand, he said. He launched his first sandwich shop in Charleston, Illinois in 1983, as a 19-year-old with a $25,000 loan from his father — and spent the next 36 years carefully and persistently growing his business, he told the \"American Optimist\" podcast during an October 2024 episode.In his first 10 years of business, for example, Liautaud only opened stores that he operated himself — 10 of them, all in Illinois, he said. From that foundation, he eventually franchised out additional locations across the country. Jimmy John's now has over 2,600 locations across 45 states.In September 2016, Liautaud sold his majority stake in the company, 65% of the business, to Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group at a valuation of \"about $3.5 billion,\" he said in the TikTok video. He stepped down as chairman in October 2019, after Roark-owned Inspire Brands acquired the rest of Jimmy John's for an undisclosed sum.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterAs with any business, the sandwich chain's growth path was hardly linear or straightforward, Liautaud noted. In 2002, for example, 70 of the then-200 Jimmy John's locations were struggling to become profitable, he said.His response: Teach the franchise owners a lesson in work ethic, he said. \"I said, 'If you're going to go into the sandwich business, this is 24/7 365. If you're in the cattle business, cattle need to get fed on Sunday. They need to get fed on Christmas day,'\" said Liautaud.\"I started telling people the truth about the business,\" he continued. \"If you're going to do this, you better be ready to be a grinder.\"Liautaud currently has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.Other highly successful entrepreneurs built their businesses using a similar mindset. Bill Gates didn't believe in vacations or weekends during Microsoft's early days, and Elon Musk has been known to occasionally sleep at the office and work throughout the night. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang works \"from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep,\" he said during a May 2024 interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collision.Now, some of them opt for more sleep and better time-management. Gates regrets his previous workaholic lifestyle, he told students at Northern Arizona University's commencement ceremony in May 2023.\"Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson,\" Gates said. \"Take time to nurture your relationships. To celebrate your successes. And to recover from your losses. Take a break when you need to. Take it easy on the people around you when they need it, too.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Don't feel guilty if you can't make it to your kids' after-school sports practices, says two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach.Leaving your kids with their teammates and coaches — without your supervision — can make them more resilient, conscientious and internally motivated athletes, the former U.S. Women's National Team soccer star said in an Oct. 21 interview on NBC's \"TODAY Show.\" All of those traits can help them grow up to become successful adults, parenting experts say.\"Drop your kids off ... Sit in your car, play on your phone, do whatever you want to do, read a book, go for a walk, but do not go to the practice,\" said Wambach, a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame who now has three step-children of her own. \"This is a time for your kids to play, to not be looking over their shoulders [to see if a parent is watching].\"If a child looks over and sees their parent looking at them on the sideline, it could \"outsource their motivation\" and make them either nervous or overly driven to impress, Wambach said in a Sept. 23 episode of her \"Welcome to the Party\" podcast.Nothing should \"encumber them from trying something new, taking a risk, making a mistake, trying something, being successful,\" said Wambach, adding: \"We want our kids to be self-starters and internally motivated.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterInternally motivated children are more likely to become adults who always strive to do their best, no matter who's watching. Encouraging kids to develop a sense of agency can similarly help them become self-motivated and successful adults, neuropsychologist William Stixrud said in a March 28 episode of the \"Raising Good Humans\" podcast. ″[Your] mission is not to make sure that they turn out a certain way or that they always do well, [but] to help them figure out who they want to be, what kind of life they want and how to create the life that they want,\" said Stixrud. \"So that they can ultimately run their own life before they leave home.\"When you do go to your kids' sports games, don't give them pointers on how to run faster or kick harder, Wambach recommended on her podcast. Instead, \"deemphasize the outcomes of winning or losing and overemphasize the acts of leadership\" by pointing out when they or other players are good teammates.Ask your child, \"What did you see out there today that was a special win that had nothing to do with the score line?\" Wambach said. \"Did you see your teammate cheering? Did you pick up the cones for your coach without being asked?\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Saying \"no\" is essential in parenting. But setting limits shouldn't start and end with that one word.As a certified child life specialist and licensed therapist, I know that saying \"no\" is meant to help kids feel safe, supported, and understood. I often help kids understand: \"Your parents aren't saying 'no' to control you, they're saying 'no' to support you.\"Boundaries deepen trust and cooperation over time. When we say \"no\" with calm, consistency, and care, we're setting limits. But we're also teaching emotion regulation, self-control, and connection. These are crucial skills our kids will carry far beyond childhood. Here's how to say no in ways that build connection instead of conflict. Turn 'no' into a teachable momentThink about a curious one-year-old who's putting sand in their mouth, pulling the dog's tail, or standing on a chair. If we just say \"no\" or \"stop\" without explaining, we might leave them feeling confusion, shame, or doubt.Instead we might say \"not in the mouth,\" \"gentle hands,\" or \"sit down.\" It's still a boundary but it teaches and guides them in a way they can learn and understand. When kids aren't adhering to limits, they might need firmer boundaries. But those can still help them figure out what to do, rather than just what not to do. For example: \"No helmet, no bike.\" \"It's not safe to ride without a helmet, so I'm going to put the bike away for now.\" \"As soon as you put your helmet on, you can ride your bike.\"Explain the 'why'Kids crave reasoning to make sense of things. Limits work best when kids understand them. With my two young children, I always lead with limits related to safety and kindness. This helps me stay mindful of when and why I'm saying \"no\" in the first place, and whether or not certain limits are negotiable. Recently, my five-year-old asked for emotional support while I was driving. I said, \"I can't hold your hand when I'm driving because it's not safe. But as soon as we get home, I can give you a hug.\" It was still a \"no,\" but it prioritized connection and safety. When kids know why, they're more likely to accept the limit even if they don't like it. This can teach them perspective-taking. For screens, helmets, and more, it might also mean explaining that \"every family has different rules, and these are ours.\" Offer control through choicesWhen kids hear the word \"no,\" they immediately feel stripped of autonomy and control — often when they're trying to explore their world and build their identity.Pair limits with choices. That can sound like:\"The park isn't a choice right now, you can choose to play in the backyard or in the basement.\"\"Choose one more thing to do and then it's time to leave.\"When kids struggle to decide, you can always resort to: \"You can choose or I can choose for you.\"Kids will feel empowered by being able to make a choice within the boundaries you've clearly set. Be consistent Toddlers test every limit, every day. And it doesn't stop after toddlerhood. It's a sign of healthy development, and it looks different at different ages and stages.This is how kids learn what's safe and where the boundaries are. When limits change easily, kids push harder. When limits are consistent, they learn to trust and expect them.Our job as parents is to communicate consistently, calmly, and clearly even when kids melt down or fight back. It teaches them that their world is safe and predictable, even when it's upsetting, and shows them unwavering support in the face of challenges.Repair when you react Sometimes we shout \"no!\" instinctively in moments of stress or fear, like when a child is running toward the street.It's natural to react that way, but it's essential to follow up with an explanation and perhaps even an apology. When my daughter recently tugged on a necklace that's already broken twice, I added: \"I'm worried it will break. It's special to me and costs money to fix.\" She said, \"I'm sorry mama. It was an accident. I won't do it again.\"Repairing and explaining after an emotional \"no\" can teach kids about accountability and empathy in a relationship and demonstrate reflection and correction.Stay firm as they get olderAs kids grow and develop, boundaries may look and sound different but the underlying message is the same.A \"no\" to going to the park after school might sound like, \"I hear you, but that's not an option today. We already have plans.\" Similarly, when it's time to end an activity: \"We're all done now\" or \"It's time to go home.\" You can even validate their feelings while staying firm: \"It's okay to be upset, but it's not going to change the plans. I'm right here with you.\"These honest conversations around limits teach kids that boundaries and connection can exist together — a lesson that will serve them through every stage of life. Kelsey Mora is Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "watch nowPrices that people pay for a variety of goods and services rose less than expected in September, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday that keeps the door wide open for another interest rate cut next week.The consumer price index showed a 0.3% increase on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 3%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for readings of 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. The annual rate reflected a 0.1 percentage point uptick from August.Excluding food and energy, core CPI showed a 0.2% monthly gain and an annual rate also at 3%, compared with estimates of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Core CPI on a monthly basis had posted 0.3% gains in both July and August.The CPI reading is the only official economic data allowed to be released during the government shutdown.\"Like an oasis slaking the thirst of a weary desert traveler, today's CPI number offered investors the first tidbit of information from the barren wasteland of government data that has existed since the shutdown started Oct 1,\" wrote John Kerschner, global head of securitized products at Janus Henderson. \"Investors were not disappointed. Inflation came in softer than expected, leading to a tepid bond market rally, and ensuring that the Fed will cut rates at next week's Open Market Committee meeting.\"A 4.1% jump in gasoline prices was the largest contributor to a report that otherwise showed inflation pressures fairly muted. Food prices saw a 0.2% increase. Commodity prices overall rose 0.5%. On an annual basis, energy was up 2.8% and food rose 3.1%.Within the food index, prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year, while nonalcoholic beverages increased 5.3%. In energy, while prices pushed higher for electricity, up 5.1%, and natural gas, up 11.7%, over the past year, gasoline prices actually fell 0.5% during the period.Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, rose just 0.2% and were up 3.6% from a year ago. Services excluding shelter costs also were 0.2% higher.New vehicles saw a 0.8% increase, but used car and truck prices fell 0.4%.Stock market futures added to gains following the release, while Treasury yields were slightly negative.\"Inflation might not be slowing but it's not surprising to the upside anymore,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation.The report provides a glimpse into the state of the U.S. economy at a time when all other data releases have been suspended. There were only limited impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs, though they likely have not made their way fully through the economy yet.watch nowCore goods prices saw just a 0.2% gain on the month. Data within the CPI report, combined with the Customs revenue generated by tariffs, indicate a \"realized\" tariff rate of just 10%, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.There are signs of \"a strong substitution effect already coming through – US companies switching to lower tariff countries for their product sourcing with the composition of imports shifting,\" Knightly wrote.\"The result is companies are better able to absorb these more modest than feared cost increases and there has been less impact on inflation than predicted so far,\" he said. \"In time we expect the realized tariff rate to rise and goods prices to be more heavily impacted, but we continue to argue that tariffs will be a one-off step change in prices rather than something that will lead to more persistent inflation.\"Final report before the FedThe BLS released the data specifically because the Social Security Administration uses it as a benchmark for cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, in benefit checks. Otherwise, the federal government has suspended all data compilation and releases until the fiscal impasse in Washington is settled. The CPI report was originally scheduled for release Oct. 15.In addition to providing a COLA guide, the CPI release is the final significant data point the Federal Reserve will get before it makes its interest rate decision next week. The Fed has a 2% inflation goal. The headline measure was last below that level in February 2021.A shopper looks at a sales advertisement at a grocery store in West Milton, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"This report will clearly keep the Fed on track to cut rates,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"The Fed has been clear that they are more focused on the softening labor data and will continue to defend their full employment mandate, even with core CPI well above their 2% target.\"Markets are pricing in a near-certainty that the central bank lowers its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point from its current target range of 4%-4.25%. Traders also are anticipating another cut in December.However, the path after that is much less clear.Worries persist that Trump's tariffs could cause another round of painful inflation. At the same time, Fed policymakers worry that a slump in hiring this year could spread, though layoffs remain low.Tariff-sensitive apparel prices saw a 0.7% increase in September, while durable goods moved 0.3% higher.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have expressed generally cautious tones about the pace of rate cuts as they weigh the threat of inflation against weakness in the labor market. For his part, Trump has insisted that inflation is no longer a problem and the Fed should be cutting aggressively.",

    "body": "The stock market has been volatile lately as investors study the latest twists and turns in the the U.S.-China trade war as well as earnings of major American companies. Despite those challenges, investors can also choose to focus on stocks of companies that can navigate short-term pressures to deliver strong, long-term returns.Tracking top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick some attractive stocks, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's business fundamentals, opportunities and challenges.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.PinterestThis first stock pick is social media company Pinterest (PINS), scheduled to announce third-quarter results on November 4. Heading into those numbers, TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated a buy rating on Pinterest and a $44 price target. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Pinterest, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $40.Blackledge expects Pinterest Q3 revenue grew by 16.6% versus the year-earlier quarter, in line with the Street's consensus estimate and toward the high end of the company's own guidance. \"We expect EBITDA growth of 20% y/y, outpacing rev growth, driven by modest [cost of revenue] and R&D leverage,\" said Blackledge.  The 5-star analyst remains confident about his mid-teens, year-over-year revenue growth estimate through the second half of 2025 and 2026, partly supported by continued adoption by advertisers of PINS' Performance+ campaign tools.Following a digital ad check call with an agency that runs more than $4 billion annually in managed advertising spending, Blackledge noted that ad spend on Pinterest rose 63% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a slight slowdown compared to 66% in the prior quarter. A TD Cowen expert noted that solid uptake continues in PINS' Performance+ campaign types.In fact, some advertisers have shifted all their Pinterest spending to Performance+. Blackledge said Performance+, rolled out in late 2024 with automated creative tools, has expanded to include automated bidding tools and other artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automated features.Blackledge ranks No. 522 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.5%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.Uber TechnologiesNext up is ride-sharing and delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER along with a 12-month price forecast of $150 after hosting a quarterly webinar with Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy and The Driverless Digest Dude, where they discussed the latest trends across rideshare, delivery and autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystems. Like Mahaney, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on UBER stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $108.Campbell was constructive about rideshare supply dynamics, given solid and stable driver economics, Mahaney noted. Campbell continues to see consistent demand and strong driver supply, particularly at Uber, which he described as operating near \"all-time highs.\" Despite robust supply, pricing continues to be high, reflecting sustained demand elasticity and limited alternatives for consumers, particularly for airport and nightlife rides. The top-rated analyst also highlighted Campbell's commentary about early-stage shifts in AV partnerships — particularly Alphabet's Waymo's evolving first-party vs third-party strategy and Uber's expanding AV integration roadmap.Mahaney further noted stable driver economics and widening platform margins. Notably, Uber's \"decoupling\" of rider fares and driver payouts is driving incremental profit margin expansion, even with steady driver income.Through incremental feature innovation, Uber is focused on enhancing ecosystem \"stickiness.\" Uber's recent \"Only on Uber\" event rolled out small feature updates, including tip guarantees and safety enhancements. While not transformative, Mahaney said Campbell sees these efforts as part of Uber's \"broader push to create alternative income channels for drivers as AVs grow share over time.\"Mahaney ranks No. 473 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13%. See Uber Technologies Financials on TipRanks.General MotorsGeneral Motors (GM) jumped 15% on Tuesday after the Cadillac and Buick parent beat the Street's revenue and earnings expectations despite a slight decline in sales. GM also raised its forward guidance, citing a lower-than-expected tariff impact.  Following the Q3 results, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on GM and raised his price target to $76 from $67. By comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $66 and an \"outperform\" rating on GM.\"We remain positive with reduced tariff burden/risk, improved profitability and [internal combustion engine] SUV/pickup onshoring tailwinds through C26E+,\" said Rakesh.The 5-star analyst noted that GM raised its 2025 guidance for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted free cash flow, driven by a smaller-than-expected impact from  tariffs, and said GM is rolling back some of its electric vehicle (EV) plans to boost profitability. That involves GM's sale of its Michigan EV battery plant stake to LG Energy, while keeping two battery plants, and transitioning its Orion plant to gas engine production from an EV focus by 2027.Rakesh believes that smaller EV losses, tariff challenges and warranty costs, and a higher combustion engine mix, will support GM's target to return to 8% to 10% EBIT margin in the North America business. Other tailwinds include $5 billion in deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise models, with about 70% gross margins, combined with a stable average selling prices.Rakesh ranks No. 67 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.8%. See General Motors Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "When Rick Senko started re-selling used items on eBay, he was \"flat broke\" — a recently unemployed single father who was desperate to earn enough money to support his 5-year-old son.That was 2008, and the first item he sold — a cell phone he bought for $35 on Craigslist and flipped on eBay for $75 — felt like discovering a \"glitch in the Matrix,\" says Senko, now 41 and based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Realizing he could turn a tidy profit by flipping used items online, he went all in. He studied brands and sales trends, exploiting market inefficiencies and often working up to 20 hours a day \"just going to the flea market, going to the thrift store, making relationships, studying my craft, learning, listing [items] every single day,\" he says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterWhat started as a way to make ends meet slowly grew into a reselling empire, bringing in millions of dollars a year in sales as one of eBay's top sellers. In 2023, Senko started a wholesale business called Technsports that sells up to 5,000 items of used clothing per day to other professional resellers. Technsports brought in more than $6.5 million in 2024 revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Technsports is profitable overall, with a profit margin of roughly 50% per item sold, Senko says.\"I have not taken a day off in almost 20 years,\" says Senko. \"It is not lost on me how fortunate I am. But it also took a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of commitment, and a tremendous amount of sacrifice to get from where I came from to now selling millions of dollars per year and living a very, very fortunate life.\"'You don't need a lot of money to start'After becoming a father at age 18, Senko worked as a CVS photography lab supervisor for five years to make ends meet for himself and his son. He attended a vocational school to earn a computer repair certificate, which landed him a better-paying job at Circuit City in Fall 2008.Two weeks later, Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Senko found himself out of work and unable to find a new job during the Great Recession. Then, his cellphone broke. \"I didn't have a lot of money, so I went onto eBay to get a pre-owned [phone],\" says Senko.He saw one on eBay listed for $75, and then spotted the same model of phone on Craigslist for $35. It was a \"lightbulb moment\" that seemed too good to be true, he says: \"I would double the money. I would get a phone for free, and then I would get my original $35 back.\"Senko bought the Craigslist phone and sold it on eBay for $70, he says. He used the profits to buy another phone on Craigslist, which he flipped on eBay to double his money again. \"I've been doing that ever since, for almost 20 years. Rinse and repeat,\" says Senko, adding: \"You don't need a lot of money to start. You don't need a lot of knowledge to start. You just need to start.\"He initially focused on electronics — from phones to video games, broken or functional, any low-priced item that he could resell within days, he says. As he learned more about which items sold better than others — and where to find in-demand stock — his earnings grew considerably, topping $100,000 in 2010, he says.Around that time, he began shifting his focus to pre-owned clothing, which requires far less \"customer support,\" he says. \"A T-shirt is not going to break in the mail.\" Clothing required a level of research that Senko was willing to do, he notes: While most people understand that electronics can be valuable, \"not everybody knows a particular Polo Ralph Lauren shirt could be worth more [than a gaming console] ... Oftentimes those [clothes] are discarded in a pile on the floor at the flea market.\"Senko started leaving home before dawn and spending most of each day picking through piles of used clothing at South Florida thrift shops, consignment shops, flea markets and garage sales, he says. Reselling gave him freedom and control over his schedule, and tapped into his competitive desire to win at all costs, he adds.'I get after it every single day'Over time, Senko built relationships with sellers at flea markets and thrift stores to ensure he got the first crack at picking through new stock. He listed and sold roughly 250 items per day, or tens of thousands of products each year, and hired up to five contract employees at a time to help him photograph items, list them online and handle shipping.In 2023, he brought in more than $2.5 million in eBay sales, documents show — up from $500,000 in 2017. But he had a feeling that he'd hit a ceiling of how many items he could list and sell per day, he says.So, that same year, Senko decided to switch up his business model. Rather than buying select pieces and selling them each individually online, he began buying clothes in bulk and selling them wholesale to other resellers willing to spend time carefully sifting through each batch. Clients sometimes buy up to 1,000 items per week, he says.\"They process it, they fulfill it and they sell it one at a time on eBay,\" Senko explains, adding: \"The most valuable asset for my business became the inventory. I'm more profitable selling more items at a smaller margin.\"The lesser time commitment also helped Senko fulfill a promise to his wife, who he met during his brief time at Circuit City, he says: that they'd work as hard as they could until his son graduated high school, and then pursue an early retirement. \"[We wanted to] be able to take a 50-year vacation,\" says Senko.He and his wife finally took time off last year to travel the country, visiting places like New York, California and Las Vegas. \"We are starting to enjoy the fruits of the labor,\" he says. But he's reluctant to actually retire, he notes: \"To say that I am mentally on the 50-year vacation? Not even close.\"Senko says it's difficult for him to shut off his competitive drive, especially when he knows there is money to be made and that he has the means and expertise to do it. And if he keeps working on Technsports, he could try to ensure that his current level of financial stability lasts for the rest of his life, he says.\"I get after it every single day. Because when you unlock [that] ability to multiply money, to take $5, put it onto eBay and sell something and get $25 back, how in the world can you rest?\" he says. \"Did I work a lot? Absolutely ... I needed to grow the business. And, ultimately, I needed to be the best.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

But for now, many services are on hold.\"Because of the shutdown and cuts, core disability services that people rely on every week are either paused, reduced or running with unpaid labor,\" said Timothy Miles, the organization's director and board liaison.As the standoff in Washington drags on, many nonprofits have lost access to federal grants and must make tough decisions about what aid they can offer and for how long.At the same time, the shutdown has put some federal assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, at risk just when the need for help is increasing. With hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contract workers furloughed and without pay, that adds to the strain on nonprofits that are needed to help fill the gap.\"Nonprofits are on the frontlines of serving communities, but a government shutdown makes it harder for them to fulfill their missions,\" said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, an industry association. \"The longer this shutdown lasts, the more people and communities are left without the critical services they depend on,\" she said.The current government shutdown is now the second-longest federal funding lapse in U.S. history.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHere's the inflation breakdown for September 2025 — in one chartInherited IRAs have a key change for 2025.

The organization has a workforce of seven and serves hundreds of people in the area.'Real long-term consequences'The longer the shutdown continues, the harder it will be for nonprofits to continue serving their communities, Saadian said.  In many cases, if an organization lays off staff or puts a program or service on pause, it can be difficult to resume operations once the shutdown ends and funding kicks in.\"Once those organizations suffer those kinds of impacts, there can be real long-term consequences, because they've lost that infrastructure, they've lost that staff,\" Saadian said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowIRVINE, Calif. — Taco Bell is going all in on beverages, starting with its Live Más Café concept.The Yum Brands chain unveiled the drink-focused store format last December, with the first location in Chula Vista, California. Ten months later came the second location, near the University of California, Irvine campus. By the end of the year, Taco Bell is projecting that it will have 30 Live Más Cafés in its portfolio, across Southern California, Dallas and Houston.Unlike McDonald's now-defunct CosMc's spinoff, which had its own standalone locations, the Live Más Café lives inside existing Taco Bell restaurants. Customers order at kiosks and can watch the \"bellristas\" assemble their drinks from behind the designated counter, which takes prime real estate in the store. The drink menu includes a range of beverage options, from blended coffees to lemonade-based drinks.The beverage-focused concept is supposed to help the Mexican-inspired chain reach its goal of generating a $5 billion drink business by 2030. Taco Bell first disclosed that target in March at an investor day, where the chain shared more about its plans to keep growing as it fuels Yum's operating profit growth.So far this year, Taco Bell has sold more than 600 million beverages, up 16% from the year-ago period, according to the company. More than 60% of the chain's orders this year have included a drink, Taco Bell said.\"I think drinks are big right now because I think people are really craving unique, interesting flavors in their beverages, and we hear that all the time from our consumers,\" said Liz Matthews, global chief food innovation officer for Taco Bell.Center stageTaco Bell's Live Más Café.Courtesy: Taco BellStepping inside the Irvine location, the Live Más Café beverage station is the clear star.Most of the self-order kiosks are positioned in front of the station's long counter. Customers have a free view of the \"bellristas\" making their specialty drinks, unlike the restaurant's other employees who assemble Crunchwrap Supremes and Chalupas hidden from sight.Digital menu boards across the restaurant highlight the beverage offerings. The drink menu spans four distinct categories: churro chillers, specialty coffees, refrescas and \"bellrista favorites.\"The churro chillers are creamy and cold milkshakes topped with churro chunks. The specialty coffees come either hot, iced or blended as a \"chiller.\" Brightly colored refrescas use either lemonade, green tea or Rockstar energy drinks as the base for their fruity flavors, such as strawberry passionfruit or mango peach. And the \"bellrista favorites\" include seasonal options, such as the autumnal caramel apple empanada churro chiller, which incorporates blended chunks of Taco Bell's apple empanada.When crafting the menu, Matthews and her team tried to stick to the chain's Mexican-inspired roots, but she said Taco Bell will always have a \"playful spirit.\"And while the Live Más Café offers plenty of options with a variety of flavors, Taco Bell kept the options to customize minimal.\"What we found when we talked to consumers, they actually really want us to curate their drink for them,\" Matthews said.To date, the Irvine location's top-selling drinks are the Mexican Chocolate Churro Chiller, the Dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast Dream Soda and the Mango Peach Agua Refresca. Six of the top 10 bestselling drinks at the location are chillers. That's a reversal from the initial test location in Chula Vista, which has seen similar demand for every drink category, according to Matthews.Since its opening day in September, the Irvine location has been selling more than 900 drinks per day, according to Taco Bell. More than a third of orders include an item from the Live Más Café menu.Meanwhile, the Chula Vista location — which exceeded its initial sales forecast by four times — is selling more than 750 beverages a day nearly a year since its opening, the company said. A quarter of all transactions include a Live Más Café beverage, according to Taco Bell.\"Given what we're seeing right now from the business results, the payback looks really attractive and in line with what our franchisees would expect for something big, but we've got a lot more to learn,\" said Taylor Montgomery, global chief brand officer of Taco Bell.'Little treat'This year, the hottest trend in fast food hasn't been a chicken sandwich or plant-based burgers. Instead, beverages of all consistencies, colors and nutritional values have taken the spotlight.For example, Shake Shack is selling lemonade with mini raspberry popping boba, inspired by the success of bubble tea. Panera Bread is testing frescas and energy refreshers in select bakery-cafés. Chick-fil-A is planning to open Daybright — a beverage-focused restaurant with specialty coffees, smoothies and cold-pressed juices — in Hiram, Georgia, later this year. And although McDonald's this summer wound down its spin-off called CosMc's that focused on drinks and snacks, it also tested new coffee drinks, refreshers and flavored sodas at more than 500 U.S. restaurants.The number of beverages sold by the top 500 chains has climbed more than 9% in the last year, according to Technomic. The swell of beverage innovation follows the speedy expansion of a number of a specialty drink chains, from upstart 7 Brew Coffee to dirty-soda inventor Swig.\"[Quick-service chains] have seen that there's a big opportunity with an entire generation and how they're interested in that 'little treat' culture,\" said Claire Conaghan, \"trendologist\" at Datassential, which tracks menu trends. \"There's options to kind of go beyond their focus area of core meal and really lean into that snacking moment.\"Generation Z and millennials are driving the trend, according to Varchasvi Singh, a foodservice analyst for Mintel. Younger generations enjoy customizing their food and beverage orders.\"Among younger consumers, in particular, we see that fast-food dining is just as much about experimentation and novelty as it is about indulgence,\" Singh said. \"They're a lot more open to trying premium menu items and personalizing their orders, whereas older generations, who have associated fast food with extreme affordability for a long time, are a little bit more critical of how expensive it has become for them.\"For Taco Bell, turning to beverages and creating the Live Más Café is part of its broader plan to appeal to younger consumers, whose spending power is projected to increase rapidly in just a few years.\"Over the past five years, we've really, really been transitioning and thinking about the brand and how to position it for Gen Z, and so Café was really born from that,\" Montgomery said. \"I think it's something like 60% of Gen Z consumers come to a restaurant or [quick-service restaurant] for an afternoon treat.\"Rather than creating a standalone Live Más Café, Taco Bell chose to put the sub-brand inside existing restaurants in part because of \"humility,\" according to Montgomery.\"Today, we're not known to be a beverage destination — yet,\" he told CNBC.Live Más Café can also help Taco Bell more broadly.\"It also acts a little bit as a test market where they can get some more real-time data. Which combos do people do the most?\" Conaghan said. \"Which customizations matter the most? Do we need every type of alternative milk or maybe just these one or two? Do we need all 15 flavors of whatever energy refresher?\"That's already started happening. Taco Bell's agua frescas, which began as a Live Más Café menu line, have since been launched nationwide.\"They're one of our top-selling items, and we didn't wait to scale the Café,\" Montgomery said. \"We pushed those in all the restaurants, and we've seen success there.\"Plus, the coffee options on the café's menu are part of Taco Bell's plan to make a bigger push into breakfast. The chain started serving the morning meal more than a decade ago but told franchisees last year that they could opt out serving breakfast; for some fast-food operators, opening early isn't profitable, plus there's the added headache of finding staff willing to work the morning shift.Taco Bell has already had some success with another sub-brand. Its Cantina format, typically found in cities, features a custom menu, alcoholic beverages and seating meant to encourage customers to linger. Since opening the first location in Chicago a decade ago, Taco Bell Cantina has grown to dozens of restaurants.Broadly, even as inflation-weary consumers pull back their spending, Taco Bell's focus on new menu items has lifted its sales; earlier this year, the company announced plans to double innovation in 2025. Taco Bell's prices have climbed 75.5% since 2019, according to Technomic's Ignite Menu. Still, customers keep coming back.In recent years, Taco Bell has been the gem of Yum's portfolio, typically outperforming both Wall Street's expectations and its sister chains, KFC and Pizza Hut. Executives have named the chain as one of the company's primary growth engines. In the second quarter, while many fast-food rivals reported shrinking sales, Taco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 4%.\"From a portfolio standpoint, we represent a pretty significant amount of Yum's operating profit, but we learn a lot from other brands, too,\" Montgomery said.Yum is expected to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell on Nov 4.Watch the video to learn more about why Taco Bell is betting on drinks.",

    "body": "European consumers are facing higher prices when going to the supermarket.Andia | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesRelations between the the U.K. and European Union are arguably at the best they've been since the Brexit vote in 2016 but there's an ongoing cold front between the neighbors over a ban on continental cheese and meat imports.In April, Britain banned people from bringing all dairy products and a range of meats from the EU into the country for personal consumption, saying the prohibition was needed in order to prevent the possible spread of Foot and Mouth Disease among British livestock after outbreaks in Europe earlier this year.British holidaymakers travelling to the continent were warned not to bring home foodstuffs such as cheese, chorizo, Serrano ham or sandwiches containing any of a wide range of banned products, even if they were sealed or bought in duty-free shops at airports. The ban extends to cakes, biscuits and chocolate containing a high level of unprocessed dairy products or fresh cream.Those found with banned items were told they'd have to surrender them at the border, or have them seized and destroyed. Anyone flouting the restriction could receive a £5,000 fine (around $6,700), the government said.The Brits' ban did not apply to commercial food imports because they undergo more stringent biosecurity requirements, such as heat treatment and veterinary health certificates, the U.K. said.Cheese shops in Paris — and particularly those situated around the Gare du Nord where Eurostar trains travel to and from the U.K. — say the restrictions have hit sales to a vital customer base.\"Tourists are very important, and especially English people,\" Alexandre Vilaca, founder and manager of Fromagerie Ferdinand in Paris, told CNBC, noting that when he opened his cheese shop eight years ago, he had chosen the Gare du Nord neighborhood for its international visitors.\"These past few years, it was very important to have English clients. We vacuum-packed the cheese so they could travel easily to the U.K., and we started to have regular clients who used to pass by our shop in order to bring some gifts to the families and friends ... But a few months ago, clients told me that it was forbidden to bring cheese back home,\" he said.\"And it's had a huge impact on our sales to U.K. clients,\" he added.A cheesemonger working in a cheese store in Paris, France, in 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVilaca said the ban was largely nonsensical, given that the French authorities were \"very, very strict\" about sanitary controls and regular checks on cheese producers, their products and their distribution. English cheese producers Vilaca worked with were also upset by the ban, he noted.\"We are proud when clients take home some souvenirs, maybe some wine, some cheese — a bit of France in their bags, so to speak. So we don't understand [the ban], we are quite upset and it is bad news because, in terms of business, it's not great.\"Why the ban?Temporary bans on continental food products entering or exiting the U.K., or vice versa, are nothing new and it's worth noting that the EU introduced a permanent ban on Brits bringing animal and dairy products, for personal consumption, into the bloc following Brexit for the same reasons: to prevent the spread of diseases.Foot and Mouth Disease, or FMD, is a serious concern for a close-knit continent like the EU as it can spread very quickly, particularly given the region's interconnected agricultural market and multiple transmission routes.FMD does not pose a risk to humans but is highly contagious to cattle, sheep and pigs, with the disease able to spread rapidly among livestock, with devastating consequences.Outbreaks of FMD were confirmed in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia earlier this year but they were contained after the countries' rapidly implemented animal health control measures in the affected establishments, including the culling of livestock and protection and surveillance zones.Not taking any chances: Cars pass through at a disinfection checkpoint set up on the border crossing between Hungary and Slovakia on March 28, 2025 in Medvedov, Slovakia. The country declared a state of emergency after several cases of foot and mouth disease in the region, including a new outbreak detected in Hungary, close to the Slovak border near Bratislava.Robert Nemeti | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose emergency measures were lifted after Germany was declared free of FMD in April, and Hungary and Slovakia have seen no new outbreaks since April.In late July, the U.K. government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in an assessment that \"while the incursions of FMD into Europe earlier in the year were undoubtedly concerning, there have been no further reports since April, suggesting that the situation in Hungary and Slovakia is under control.\"While the report's authors said the risk of incursion of FMD to the U.K. was, in July, was considered a 'low (rare but can occur)' risk, the report cautioned that FMD can remain undetected for several months.The U.K. government told CNBC that, despite the containment of European FMD outbreaks, the ongoing ban on personal imports of cheese and many meats aimed to protect British farmers and U.K. food security.\"Earlier this year, we took immediate action to ban personal imports of meat and dairy from Europe after a wave of foot and mouth cases. We are also investing £1 billion [$1.3 billion] in a new National Biosecurity Centre to boost our world leading facilities and protect our farmers, food supply and economy,\" a spokesman for Defra told CNBC.\"We will do whatever it takes to protect our farmers from animal disease,\" the spokesperson added.Almost six months into the ban, however, and questions are being asked whether the ongoing restrictions are excessive, and no longer necessary.Defra stressed its not alone in implementing the current restrictions, and is only doing what the EU has been doing for several years, since Brexit, as standard practice.Asked when the ban might be lifted, given that cases of FMD are now contained on the continent, Defra said the government's \"FMD response remains under constant review\" and that it will \"retain restrictions in England while personal imports of affected products pose biosecurity risks to Great Britain.\"Hard lessonsThe U.K. and EU have learned the hard way what an outbreak of FMD can cause.Cows of Breier Cattle Farm are pictured at a farm near Budapest on March 11, 2025. Hungary detected its first foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in over 50 years on March 7, 2025, at a cattle farm near the Slovak border. The country's food safety agency, introduced extremely strict measures to prevent the further spread of the disease, including a ban on the movement of susceptible species. Ferenc Isza | Afp | Getty ImagesThe 2001 epidemic, which first broke out in the U.K. before spreading to the continent, had a devastating impact on the British farming community with over six million animals having to be destroyed and estimated to have cost the U.K.'s public and private sector a combined £8 billion.In the EU, four million animals were destroyed and the outbreak is estimated to have cost member states 2.7 billion euros in terms of eradication measures and compensation to farmers.The U.K.'s last outbreak, in 2007, only affected eight farms but was estimated to have cost £147 million overall, due to large-scale livestock movement bans.",

    "body": "Timothy Mellon, seen outside an inspection train during a property tour in 1981. Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ... Never have been, never will be.\"Mellon's contribution aims to help cover the cost of U.S. military personnel's salaries and benefits as the federal shutdown drags on.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe donation might have violated the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from spending funds that have not been appropriated by Congress, the Times reported.Mellon's gift is also unlikely to go far in offsetting the cost of military pay.There are more than 1.3 million troops in the active-duty military, and the Trump administration's 2025 budget included a request of around $600 billion in military compensation, the Times reported.Mellon, whose grandfather, Andrew Mellon, was one of the longest-serving Treasury secretaries, is a longtime Trump donor.He contributed $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, one of the biggest single donations ever publicly shared, The Times reported.A spokesman for Sen. Chris Coons told NBC News that the Delaware Democrat is concerned about allowing anonymous donors to fund government spending.\"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" the spokesman said.Read the complete Times report here.",

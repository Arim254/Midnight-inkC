Date and context is unclear.U.s. Justice Department | Via ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday is releasing three million additional pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with 2,000 videos and about 180,000 images, a top DOJ official said.The large release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ was not complying with the requirement under federal law that all files related to the notorious sex offender Epstein be publicly released.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday the DOJ was not releasing the rest of the more than 6 million total pages that have been identified as potentially responsive to the Epstein Transparency Act.He said that no more documents would be released.\"We complied with the statute,\" Blanche said. \"We complied with the Act. We did not protect President Trump ... or anybody.\"President Donald Trump had been friends with Epstein for years before the two men had a falling out in the mid-2000s.\"There's not some tranche of super-secret documents about Jeffrey Epstein that we're withholding,\" Blanche said at a press conference.This is breaking news.

The potential maximum sentence for the remaining two counts for causing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death under federal stalking laws is \"life in prison without parole,\" Garnett noted. Thompson was fatally shot on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024.The third count accused Mangione of the murder of Thompson through the use of a firearm during that alleged stalking. That count, which the judge tossed out, would have made Mangione eligible for a possible death sentence.

Lemon, an independent reporter who hosts The Don Lemon Show on YouTube, has said he was reporting on the protest. A federal magistrate judge last week reportedly rejected a criminal complaint that was brought against him.In Friday's statement, Lowell called Lemon's arrest an \"unprecedented attack on the First Amendment\" and a \"transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration.\"\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said. ",

    "body": "Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference for Eli Lilly and Company in Houston, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other phase three trials on the drug this year. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies – including both Lilly and Novo – from the levies for three years. Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs. ",

Like other hyperscalers, Microsoft has invested huge sums in its AI infrastructure buildout. But Meta reported huge AI spending on the same day and its stock jumped 8%.watch nowWhy did Microsoft's stock drop?Investors latched onto the growth of Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure and other cloud services, which came in at 39% below StreetAccount's 39.4% consensus. Those areas saw 40% growth in the fiscal first quarter.The company's CFO Amy Hood said that the cloud business' results could have been higher if the company had allocated more data center infrastructure to customers rather than prioritising in-house needs.Implied operating margin for third-quarter also came up short, with Microsoft calling for about $12.6 billion in revenue from the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows, which was lower than StreetAccount's $13.7 billion consensus.What analysts are sayingIn a post-earnings note on Thursday, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said most investors focused solely on Azure growth to judge the health of Microsoft's business, especially in its performance around AI.\"It now looks like the company will not really accelerate Azure further from here, due to the law of large numbers and extra capacity being used for its own, higher-margin, first party offerings like Co-Pilot and its own AI R&D efforts,\" he said.\"Investors need, we believe, to understand that management made a cognizant decision to focus on what is best for the company long term rather than driving the stock up this quarter or even over last quarter and a few quarters to come (as capacity constraints likely abate),\" Mark L. Moerdler, analyst at Bernstein said in a Thursday note.There was still plenty of bullishness in the market for Microsoft stock. Wells Fargo, in a Thursday note, rated shares as overweight, adding that its \"early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market\" justify its high trading price.",

DHS, which has been the target of scathing criticism by Democrats over its aggressive immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, would be temporarily funded by a stopgap measure under the agreement with longer-term funding being revisited later.A Republican Senate aide told MS Now that Graham's hold on the deal stems from a provision passed by the House that stripped legislative language that would have allowed senators to sue for up to $500,000 if their phone records were obtained during the so-called Arctic Frost investigation by then-special counsel Jack Smith.",

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

    "body": "watch nowExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods said Friday that Venezuela needs to transition to democracy in order for investment in the South American nation's dilapidated oil industry to make sense. President Donald Trump is pressuring oil companies to invest at least $100 billion in Venezuela to rebuild the country's oil industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 3. But Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that Venezuela is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. The Exxon CEO's blunt assessment angered the president who threatened to cut the oil major out of any future investment in the country.Woods stoody by his assessment in an interview with CNBC on Friday. He said the government in Caracas needs to make major reforms for Exxon to seriously consider returning to Venezuela. \"Those priorities start with one, stabilizing the country,\" Woods told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"Second is to kick start the economy and try to recover some of the damage that's been done over the decades of abuse that the dictators brought in, and then ultimately to transition into representative government.\" The Trump administration has not laid out a clear plan for Venezuela to hold elections and transition to democratic government. Senior administration officials have said they are focused right now on stabilizing the country and improving its economy through oil sales. The U.S. has been working with Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez, who is a longstanding insider in the authoritarian regime that former President Hugo Chavez built. The cooperation with Rodriguez has raised concern among some observers that the current regime could remain in place so long as it meets the Trump administration's demands on oil. Exxon exited Venezuela in 2007 after its assets were seized by the Chavez regime. It has billions of dollars in oustanding claims against Caracas from the nationalization. \"Frankly, from our perspective, there's a principle that we stand on that if you don't uphold the sanctity of the contracts, if you choose to instead to steal the investments that we made and undermine the work that we've been doing, that we can't continue to work with you,\" Woods said. Trump told oil industry CEOs at the White House meeting that his administration is not planning to force Venezuela to play claims from the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said on Jan. 9. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world but its energy infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. Investment to repair Venezuela's infrastructure could prove financially challenging right now as a surplus of crude oil in the world has depressed prices. Oil prices in 2025 posted their steepest annual loss since 2020 as OPEC+ increased production and the U.S. continued to pump oil at a strong clip.Earlier Friday, Exxon reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, but both profit and revenue were down from the year-ago period due to weak crude prices. Notably, Exxon achieved its highest full-year net production in more than 40 years at 4.7 million barrels per day. It pumped 4.98 million bpd in the quarter with its assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana setting output records for the period.Exxon's competitor Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron says it can increase production in Venezuela by 50% over the next 18 to 24 months. While Exxon's stock was down more than 1% after reporting its results, its shares have had a strong start to the year. The stock has gained nearly 16% in 2026, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.6% bump. ",

Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump, his two eldest sons, and his family business sued the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department over alleged leaks of their confidential tax information, court records showed Thursday.The plaintiffs seek at least $10 billion in damages, according to the lawsuit in Miami federal court.The civil complaint alleges that the IRS and Treasury failed in their obligation to prevent the leak of those tax records by former IRS employee Charles \"Chaz\" Littlejohn in 2019 and 2020.In addition to Trump, the plaintiffs are his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and the Trump Organization, which the sons run.A spokesman for Trump's legal team told CNBC in a statement, \"The IRS wrongly allowed a rogue, politically-motivated employee to leak private and confidential information about President Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization to the New York Times, ProPublica and other left-wing news outlets, which was then illegally released to millions of people.\"\"President Trump continues to hold those who wrong America and Americans accountable,\" the spokesman said.The suit was filed three days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he had canceled all of his department's contracts with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton in connection with the company's contractor, Littlejohn, stealing and leaking confidential tax returns.Read more CNBC politics coverageMan poses as FBI agent to try to free Luigi Mangione from jail, source saysTrump backs Senate government funding deal that includes DHS extensionSenate Ag Committee advances Republican crypto billSenators closing in on funding federal government less than two days from shutdownWatch live: Trump holds Cabinet meeting at White HouseHoman: ICE and CBP crafting drawdown plan in Minnesota, says improvements neededDenmark lauds talks with U.S. over Greenland: 'Now we are back on track'Government shutdown: Republicans mull escape hatch as Congress careens toward deadline'ICE is not a law unto itself,' Minnesota judge says after immigrant releasedLittlejohn, 40, is serving a five-year prison sentence after having pleaded guilty in October 2023 to one count of disclosure of tax return information.He admitted to leaking Trump's tax records to The New York Times, and also admitted to leaking records about wealthy individuals to the news outlet ProPublica.The new lawsuit says that Littlejohn, in a 2024 deposition, admitted disclosing \"Trump information [that] included all businesses that he had owned\" to the investigative news outlet ProPublica.The suit asserts that ProPublica's subsequent reporting on Trump's tax documents falsely claimed that the records contained \"versions of fraud.\"While that quote does appear in ProPublica's October 2019 report, it comes from Nancy Wallace, a finance and real estate professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business.Wallace was one of a dozen real estate professionals interviewed by ProPublica who said they saw no clear explanation for \"multiple inconsistencies in the documents,\" according to the report.\"Defendants have caused Plaintiffs reputational and financial harm, public embarrassment, unfairly tarnished their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light, and negatively affected President Trump, and the other Plaintiffs' public standing,\" the lawsuit says.It's all but unheard of for a sitting president to sue their own administration, and the exorbitant damages figure being demanded raises various conflict-of-interest questions.But Trump has reportedly made similar moves in the recent past: The New York Times reported in October that Trump sought $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for its past investigations into him.",

    "body": "watch nowChevron CEO Mike Wirth said Friday that Venezuela has taken positive steps to protect investment by private oil companies since the Trump administration captured former President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela on Thursday passed reforms to its hydrocarbon law that ease state control of the oil industry and grants private producers more autonomy. Wirth said Chevron is still reviewing the legislation. The CEO said security of contracts, commercial stability and regulatory predictability are key to attract investment in Venezuela. \"We see Venezuela taking steps in a positive direction to address those issues, which will encourage investment, not only from a company like ours, but from from others that I think are also considering the opportunities there,\" Wirth told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" in an interview. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Treasury Department. It is currently producing about 250,000 barrels per day through joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Wirth said Friday that Chevron could increase production in Venezuela by up to 50% over the next 18 to 24 months if the company receives authorization from the U.S. government.Wall Street largely views Chevron as the U.S. oil company best positioned to benefit from the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela due to presence in the country and its relationship with PDVSA. \"We've stayed when others didn't,\" Wirth said. \"We're getting paid back some debts that we're owed, and it does give us a significant head start. And the country has tremendous long term potential.\"The CEO said the security situation is mostly stable where Chevron operates though there are areas of Venezuela that are less safe. \"We've got good, strong safety protocols and security protocols in place in the country,\"  Wirth said. \"And our operations have continued uninterrupted through this entire period of time.\"Chevron reported fourth-quarter earnings on Friday that beat estimates. The oil major increased production in 2025 by 12% worldwide and 16% in the U.S. to record levels.While Chevron is ready to ramp up production, competitor ExxonMobil is wary of returning to Venezuela after its assets were seized twice in the past. Exxon CEO Darren Woods has called the country uninvestable. He told CNBC on Friday that the country needs to transition to democracy for investment to make sense.President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Chevron shares were trading up 1.4% after reporting its results. The stock has gain nearly 14% since the start of the year, outpacing the broader market. ",

Denis Balibouse | ReutersGold and silver prices plunged Friday, as President Donald Trump's nomination for the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, appeared to relieve concerns about the central bank's independence. By 7:12 a.m. ET, spot silver was down 10.6% to settle at around $103.81 an ounce, paring back earlier losses. In the early hours of the morning, the metal had plummeted as much as 16% and dipped below the $100 milestone. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silverMeanwhile, spot gold shed around 5.7% to trade at $5,136.27 an ounce. Earlier, the safe-haven metal had lost as much as 7%. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot goldPrices of the precious metals also faltered on futures exchanges, with front-month gold contracts losing 3.4% in New York, while silver futures for February delivery were down by 10%. The sell-off gripped the wider precious metals market, with spot platinum dropping more than 10%, while palladium fell close to 8%. On Friday, Trump named Warsh — who served at the central bank during the 2008 financial crisis — successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had been the favorite to replace Powell for some time, but Warsh became the front-runner in prediction markets in recent days. In a note on Friday morning, Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha said the market was \"trading Warsh hawkish.\"\"The Warsh pick should help stabilize the dollar some and reduce (though not eliminate) the asymmetric risk of deep extended dollar weakness by challenging debasement trades – which is also why gold and silver are sharply lower,\" the firm's vice chairman said.\"But, we advise against overdoing the Warsh hawkish trade across asset markets – and even see some risk of a whipsaw. We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker.\"Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday that a \"perfect storm\" of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Washington's threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.More recently, he said, speculation over who would be nominated as the next Fed chair had been influencing metals markets. \"The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that's been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit,\" Wewel said, prior to Trump's announcement. 'Even good assets can sell-off'Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 65% and 150%, respectively, over the course of the year. Those gains have largely continued into 2026, with silver adding 45% while gold is up 19% year to date. On stock exchanges across the globe, the impact of the metals sell-off was visible on Friday. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 Basic Resources index — which includes the Continent's most valuable mining companies — was down 2% in afternoon trading. London-listed Fresnillo, the world's biggest silver producer, was last seen 4% lower, paring earlier losses.  In premarket trade on Wall Street, silver miner Endeavour Silver was down 9%, while Coeur Mining lost 8%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the ProShares Ultra Silver fund last seen more than 22% lower ahead of the opening bell. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 11.2%. Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the decline of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely \"a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk.\" \"Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding,\" she said. \"When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn't accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning.\"Meanwhile, Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, contended that gold's run to the $5,000 mark had happened \"too easily.\" He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize. \"Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months,\" he said. \"The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump's trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPanama's top court has ruled against Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, saying a concession held by a subsidiary of the firm to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal was unconstitutional.The outcome is widely seen as a victory for the Trump administration's security ambitions in the Western Hemisphere, with the U.S. seeking to counter China's strategic influence in the region.In a brief statement published late Thursday, the Supreme Court of Panama said the terms under which Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, runs the port of Balboa on the Pacific Coast and Cristóbal on the Atlantic violated the country's constitution and were no longer valid.The court said it came to its decision after \"extensive deliberation\" but did not provide further details on the next steps.It also raises questions about the future ownership of some Panama Canal operations, including CK Hutchison's proposed $23 billion sale of 43 ports across the globe to a consortium led by BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). BlackRock declined to comment on the ruling. CK Hutchison and MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Read moreThe decision comes roughly one year after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to seize control of the Panama Canal, saying the critically important waterway was \"vital to our country\" and claiming, \"it's being operated by China.\" The Trump administration has made blocking China's influence over the Panama Canal one of its top priorities.\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal but we have superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the Donroe Doctrine,\" Trump said earlier this month, shortly after U.S. troops conducted an operation to capture Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3.\"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again,\" Trump said. China pledges to take necessary measuresPPC, which has held the contract to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal since the 1990s, said on Friday that the decision was inconsistent with the relevant legal framework.\"The new ruling, based on available information, lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country,\" PPC said in a statement. Shares of CK Hutchison closed 4.6% lower on Friday as Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped over 2% for the session.Aerial photograph of the Panama Canal at sunset, March 2025.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that the decision was \"contrary to the laws governing Panama's approval of the relevant franchises, and that the companies will reserve all rights, including legal proceedings.\" The spokesperson added that Beijing would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. — CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowSandisk's stock popped 14% after the company crushed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter estimates, as the artificial intelligence boom sent demand for its chips skyrocketing. The flash storage memory company reported earnings of $6.20 per share, excluding items, blowing past the $3.62 per share expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue totaled $3.03 billion, topping a forecast of $2.69 billion. Shares had jumped more than 20% in the premarket. Sandisk's third-quarter forecast also outpaced expectations for analysts. Sandisk guided for between $4.4 billion and $4.8 billion in revenue for the quarter. That blew away the $2.93 billion expected by FactSet. The company expects adjusted earnings between $12 and $14 per share in the third quarter, more than double the $5.11 estimate from analysts. Raymond James analysts upgraded the stock to an outperform rating, citing Sandisk's pricing momentum as new supply struggles to come online. \"We know demand is exceptionally strong and likely only growing, supply is tightening to the point of potentially being sold out for years,\" the firm wrote, believing the company should benefit from \"longer-lived\" datacenter production.

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures as he departs after a business leaders reception with the US President on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 21, 2026. Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesApple reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday that surpassed expectations, with revenue soaring 16% on an annual basis.  Shares of the company were up more than 1% in extended trading. Here are the results versus what Wall Street was expecting, according to LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in December:EPS: $2.84 vs. $2.67 estimated Revenue: $143.76 billion vs. $138.48 billion estimated Here is how Apple performed versus LSEG consensus estimates:  iPhone revenue: $85.27 billion vs. $78.65 billion estimatedMac revenue: $8.39 billion vs. $8.95 billion estimated iPad revenue: $8.60 billion vs. $8.13 billion estimated Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue: $11.49 billion vs. $12.04 billion estimated Services revenue: $30.01 billion vs. $30.07 billion estimatedGross margin: 48.2% vs. 47.5% estimated Finance chief Kevan Parekh said that Apple expects revenue this quarter to rise between 13% and 16% on an annual basis, which would be equivalent to between $107.8 billion and $110.66 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $104.84 billion. Apple said it expects constrained iPhone supply during the period. Apple also said it expects its Services unit to have a year-over-year growth rate similar to the 14% in the December quarter. The company reported $42.1 billion in net income, or $2.84 per share, versus $36.33 billion, or $2.40 per  share, in the year-ago period.  Overall iPhone revenue surged 23% on an annual basis to $85.27 billion, which the company attributed to strong sales of the iPhone 17 models released in September.  \"The demand for iPhone was just simply staggering,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach. The strong growth is a reversal from the holiday quarter last year, when Apple reported iPhone sales that declined slightly. Cook said Apple now has an active base of 2.5 billion iPhones, Macs and other Apple devices, up from 2.35 billion announced in January last year. That number is closely watched because it points to the addressable market for Apple services, as well as for software on the company's platforms.  Apple saw particularly strong results in China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sales in the region surged 38% during the quarter to $25.53 billion. Cook said that the performance in the region was driven by iPhone sales.  \"We set an all-time record for upgraders in mainland China, and we saw double-digit growth on switchers,\" Cook said. Upgraders refers to current iPhone users who bought newer models, and switchers means new customers who previously had phones from different brands.  In China, Apple \"saw a lift that, frankly, was much greater than we thought we would see,\" Cook said, adding that it was \"product-driven.\" Apple's sales of Mac laptops came up short of Wall Street expectations, and fell 7% on an annual basis. The company released an updated MacBook Pro laptop with a new M4 chip in November.The iPad business grew 6% in the quarter on an annual basis to $8.6 billion in revenue, beating expectations. Cook said that half of the people who bought an iPad during the quarter had not previously owned one.  The company reports AirPods, Apple Watch, Vision Pro and other accessories in a category called Wearables, Home and Accessories. Those sales fell 2% on an annual basis and missed Wall Street estimates.  Apple's services business includes subscriptions such as Apple TV and iCloud as well as advertising revenue from licensing agreements with Google, AppleCare warranties and other offerings. It grew 14% on an annual basis to $26.34 billion in sales. Cook said Apple TV's viewership rose 36% in December from a year ago.Earlier this month, the company announced it would partner with Google to use its Gemini AI model to power Apple Intelligence software. Apple has spent much less on artificial intelligence technology than its peers, such as Meta and Microsoft, which have committed to spending hundreds of billions on AI infrastructure.  \"We have absolutely the best platforms in the world for AI,\" Cook said.  Apple recorded $2.37 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, down from $2.94 billion in the same period last year. But research and development expenses increased to $10.89 billion from $8.27 billion in the year-ago period.  \"AI is going to require incremental investment on top of our normal product road map investment,\" Parekh said. All of Apple's devices, including the iPhone, Mac and iPad, use a lot of storage and memory, raising questions about how the company plans to handle increased component costs as memory prices around the world are surging because of an AI-related shortage.  \"We're in a supply chain mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand we're currently constrained,\" Cook said. \"At this point, it's difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance.\"Cook added that one of the constraints was with the advanced chip manufacturing needed for Apple's processors. He also said that memory prices had a minimal impact during the quarter, but the company expects a bigger effect during the current period \"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. Parekh said that Apple spent nearly $32 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends. WATCH: Apple told us all about its new iPhone chips and on-device AI plans ",

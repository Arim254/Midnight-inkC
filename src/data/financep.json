    "body": "A researcher works in the lab at the Moderna headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, March 26, 2024.Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesModerna said on Wednesday that the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application in a move that stunned Wall Street and the medical community. The announcement clears a path forward for the vaccine, which is key to Moderna's experimental combination Covid-flu jab and the company's goal of breaking even by 2028. The FDA is slated to make a decision on the flu shot on Aug. 5, which would enable Moderna to make the vaccine available for the upcoming influenza season. \"Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu,\" said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a release. Shares of the biotech company rose more than 6% on Wednesday. Moderna said it had a \"constructive\" meeting with the FDA and proposed a revised regulatory approach that addresses criticisms the agency made when refusing to accept the application last week, tailoring its new proposal to an older population.Under the new approach, Moderna is seeking full approval for the shot in adults ages 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval of the shot for people 65 and up. The latter means that upon approval, Moderna will have to conduct an additional post-marketing study in older adults to confirm the vaccine's benefits. In a statement, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that the FDA has accepted the modified application.The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot in a Phase 3 trial, arguing that it \"does not reflect the best-available standard of care\" in the U.S. The FDA's previous feedback expressed a preference for Moderna to use a higher-dose vaccine for older adults as a comparator in the trial.In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday before the announcement, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary did not indicate that the agency would reverse course. But he emphasized that the FDA reviewed the application and the initial late-stage trial on the shot when it came in, so \"it's a little bit of a misnomer to say that it was not looked at.\"Makary said the agency's guidance to Moderna on its mRNA-based flu shot \"was pretty clear.\" He said the FDA recommended that the group of participants ages 65 and up in the study who didn't take Moderna's shot receive the \"standard of care, not the substandard of care\" as a comparison product. Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The company also said it was inconsistent with the FDA's prior written communication about the trial design, even before the study began, where the agency said using the standard flu shot would be \"acceptable.\"The saga follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy and regulation over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Moderna last week said the decision specifically stemmed from the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots without evidence. Last week, Moderna released a so-called Refusal to File letter from the FDA that was signed by Prasad on Feb. 3. HHS does not typically share those letters, and the agency has not provided any details on who drove the decision-making on the company's application. When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, which Kennedy and some of his supporters have criticized as unsafe, Makary told CNBC on Wednesday that he's \"hopeful and optimistic\" about the platform but would also \"like to see the data.\" \"We're not going to get ahead of the game,\" he said. \"We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases. ...\"",

    "body": "watch nowWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be \"disciplined.\"In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore.\"I mean, the paper is an embarrassment,\" Hassett said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"The paper in question was published Feb. 12 on the New York Fed's website.Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. The paper found that some 90% of the added costs from tariffs were being passed on, though it noted that the impact waned slightly as the year progressed.However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living.\"Prices have gone down. Inflation is down over time. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs,\" he said. \"So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. It's really just an embarrassment. I can't imagine who signed off on it.\"The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A New York Fed official declined comment.",

    "body": "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and on Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. Scott Kowalchyk | CBS | Getty Images\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night called CBS' denial of his claim that it blocked the broadcast of his interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico \"crap\" — and urged the network and its parent, Paramount Skydance, to stand up to the \"bullies\" in the Trump administration.Colbert's broadside came hours after CBS issued a statement on the controversy. The host, whose show will end in May as it was canceled by CBS, held up a printed copy of the network's statement about Talarico's interview during his show Tuesday night and said, \"I don't even know what to do with this crap.\"He then pulled a plastic doggy bag from behind his desk, picked up the statement, tied a knot and mimed throwing it away before cutting to commercial.The controversy is the latest flap to spark speculation that CBS is currying favor with the Trump administration as Paramount makes a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros Discovery. If WBD's shareholders accept Paramount's bid, federal government regulators would need to sign off on the deal.Colbert had invited Talarico, who is running in the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, to appear on Monday night's broadcast of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"But early in that night's show, Colbert said to his studio audience that CBS' lawyers had told him \"in no uncertain terms ... that we could not have him on the broadcast.\" Colbert said the lawyers wanted to avoid running afoul of new guidance by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that suggests broadcast talk shows could be required to abide by the so-called equal time provision requiring broadcasters to give political candidates equal coverage if their opponents appear on air.Colbert noted that he had put Talarico's interview on the \"Late Show\" YouTube channel — the video has been seen more than 4.4 million times.CBS, in its statement on Tuesday afternoon, denied Colbert's main allegation that it had barred the interview from being aired.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,\" the network said.\"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett [D-Texas], and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled,\" CBS said.Colbert scoffed at the statement during Tuesday's show.\"They know damn well that every word of my script last night was approved by CBS lawyers who, for the record, approved every script that goes on the air,\" Colbert said.\"In fact, between the monologue I did last night, and before I did the second act talking about this issue, I had to go backstage,\" he said. \"I got called backstage to get more notes from these lawyers. Something that had never, ever happened before, and they told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception, and I used that language,\" Colbert said. \"So I don't know what this is about.\"Colbert went on to say he wasn't \"mad\" at the network and does not want an \"adversarial relationship.\"\"I'm just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies,\" he said.\"Come on. You're Paramount. No, no, no, you're more than that. You're Paramount+,\" Colbert cracked. \"And for the lawyers to release this [statement] without even talking to me is really surprising.\"The host also noted that there has long been \"a very famous exception to\" the equal time rule, \"and that exception included talk shows, interviews with politicians.\"\"We looked, and we can't find one example of this rule being enforced for any talk show interview, not only for my entire late-night career, but for anyone's late-night career, going back to the 1960s,\" he said.Colbert said that Carr has \"not gotten rid of\" that exception for talk show hosts \"yet.\"\"But CBS generously did it for him and told me, unilaterally, that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 20 years of this job,\" he added.\"Now, that decision, I want to be clear, is their right, just like I have the right to talk about their decision on air last night,\" Colbert said.Paramount did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Early voting in the Texas Democratic primary began Tuesday. Talarico is in a close contest against U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner will face the victor of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.CNBC has reached out to the FCC for comment.",

Because of the decline in bitcoin's price, the value of El Salvador's holdings of that cryptocurrency has fallen to about $500 million, down from a high of $800 million last year.Solomon commented weeks after a Senate committee advanced a cryptocurrency market bill that would create a national regulatory structure for crypto.That bill has stalled over a dispute about whether digital asset companies would be allowed to offer customers rewards, or payments on stablecoins that are held in those companies. Banks have opposed such rewards, which could compete with their interest payments on depositors' accounts.Solomon said Wednesday that he is \"super-interested in\" crypto-related business.Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"We obviously are doing a bunch of things around digitization and tokenization,\" he said.\"We touch all that stuff,\" Solomon said.But, he added, \"it doesn't mean it's central to what we do. These kinds of assets are still a small percentage\" of Goldman's business.\"We have clients, our clients have needs, we're here to serve our clients.\"Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, earlier Wednesday at the conference, told Eisen on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he still has \"some concerns\" about the crypto market structure bill, but \"hopefully by April\" it will be passed by Congress and be able to be signed by President Donald Trump.Moreno brushed aside concerns that if the bill is not passed soon, it could die because of the chance that Democrats would regain majority control of the Senate and House of Representatives. Republicans are increasingly fearful they will lose control of at least the House in November's midterm elections.\"The House isn't going to go Democrat, and neither is the Senate,\" Moreno predicted.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, when asked about the crypto bill, said \"there is now a path forward where we can get a win-win-win outcome here: a win for the crypto industry, and a win for the banks, and a win for the American consumer to get President Trump's crypto agenda through to the finish line so we can make America the crypto capital of the world.\"",

    "body": "This Sept. 19, 2014 file photo shows retail mogul Leslie Wexner, at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. Wexner is severing his last ties with the retail empire that he founded in 1963.Jay LaPrete | APBillionaire Leslie Wexner said during a congressional deposition Wednesday that he had virtually no social relationship with Jeffrey Epstein — but the House Oversight Committee's top-ranking Democrat called that claim \"bogus.\"\"I do not believe when Mr. Wexner says that he did not have a personal relationship or a friendly relationship\" with the notorious sex offender, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., told reporters in Ohio during a break in the closed-door proceedings.Garcia also sharply criticized the Department of Justice after hearing from Wexner that he has not been contacted by the FBI on Epstein-related matters.\"What the hell is going on? That is shameful,\" Garcia said.The deposition of the 88-year-old retail billionaire, which resumed after the break, is occurring weeks after the DOJ released millions of additional files revealing new links between Epstein and major figures in business and politics.Wexner, the retired founder of Victoria's Secret former parent company L Brands, has faced intense scrutiny for years over his personal and financial relationships with Epstein. The latest document dump raises new questions about the extent of that relationship and how long it lasted, despite Wexner's claim that it was \"completely severed\" nearly two decades ago.He insists he neither knew about nor participated in any criminal activity related to Epstein. \"I was naïve, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" Wexner said in a statement submitted to the Oversight Committee ahead of the deposition.\"He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide,\" Wexner said.He went on to call Epstein a \"master manipulator\" who \"lived a double life,\" insisting that any criminal activities were \"most carefully and fully hid from me.\"\"Again, to be clear, I never saw or heard about Epstein being in the company of a minor girl,\" Wexner said.Decades earlier, Wexner had given Epstein, a high school math teacher turned well-connected money manager, power of attorney over his finances. Wexner had long been Epstein's only publicly known client.\"The most important information for us is really about the money,\" Garcia said on CNN earlier Wednesday.\"We know that Wexner was Jeffrey Epstein's single largest benefactor,\" Garcia said. \"When you think about Epstein's wealth, whether it was the plane, the island, the amount of money when had, his homes — much of that came directly from Wexner.\"\"We're not exactly sure why. It's not clear,\" he said. \"When you talk to survivors, they'll all share with you that Wexner was at the center of what Epstein was doing.\"Wexner has not been charged with any crime. After Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 — and died by suicide in jail a month later — Wexner said he was embarrassed to have been \"taken advantage of by someone who is ... so depraved.\"The Oversight Committee had subpoenaed Wexner and other Epstein associates in January with bipartisan support.In his prepared statement before Wednesday's deposition, Wexner maintained that he \"completely and irrevocably cut ties with Epstein nearly twenty years ago when I learned that he was an abuser, a crook, and a liar.\"\"And, let me be crystal clear: I never witnessed nor had any knowledge of Epstein's criminal activity. I was never a participant nor coconspirator in any of Epstein's illegal activities. To my enormous embarrassment and regret I, like many others, was duped by a world-class con man. I cannot undo that part of my personal history even as I regret ever having met him,\" Wexner's statement said.Wexner said he hired Epstein as a financial manager years after being introduced to him in the 1980s by  insurance giant Aon's former vice chairman Bob Meister. Wexner also said he consulted about Epstein with Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, of Epstein's former employer Bear Stearns, and Elie de Rothschild of the Rothschild family banking dynasty, whom Epstein offered as a reference.Epstein initially refused to take on Wexner as a client, instead offering occasional financial advice for free. \"Little did I realize that, from the very start, Epstein was conniving to gain my trust,\" Wexner's statement read.Wexner eventually succeeded in formally hiring Epstein. \"Because my public company and other duties required my full attention, I provided Epstein with a power of attorney so he could execute transactions quickly, without constantly requiring my signature,\" according to Wexner.\"The need for a power of attorney was clear to me, and I provided the same scope of authority to Epstein as I did to his successor, Dennis Hersch,\" the statement said. \"What I did not anticipate was Epstein misusing the trust I placed in him despite his fiduciary obligation to act in my best interest.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airAs for the allegations that Epstein ran a widespread sex trafficking operation that exploited girls and young women, Wexner is adamant that he knew nothing about it.\"He knew that I never would have tolerated his horrible behavior. Not any of it. At no time did I ever witness the side of Epstein's life for which he is now infamous,\" Wexner's statement said.Wexner also said he never traveled on Epstein's airplane and disputed the \"rumor\" that he gave Epstein a townhouse in New York. Epstein \"purchased it from me for what I was told was the appraised value,\" and Wexner never entered the house afterward, according to the statement.Wexner admitted visiting Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but said he did so only once, when his wife and young children \"stopped for a few hours one morning while we were on a cruise on our boat.\"Wexner said he revoked Epstein's power of attorney in September 2007, months before Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to a state charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution.The Wexner Foundation told CNBC in a statement, \"We hold in our hearts the survivors of Epstein's horrific crimes and pray for their healing and strength.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowCadence Design Systems stock rose 9% on Wednesday after the chip design software company reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. The San Jose-based company reported financials after the bell Tuesday, posting an adjusted earnings per share of $1.99 on revenue of $1.44 billion in the fourth-quarter of 2025, about 6% higher versus the prior year on both measures.Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting an EPS of $1.91 and revenue of $1.42 billion.CEO Anirudh Devgan told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday that about 45% of its business is now coming from what he called \"system companies,\" which include hyperscalers and end producers of phones and cars.\"System companies want to optimize the hardware and software stack together, and one way to do that is the critical component, is designing their own chips that are optimized to their workload,\" Devgan said. Cadence Design Systems has been riding a wave of artificial intelligence-related capital expenditures and research and development efforts by a range of tech enterprises working to create large language models and infuse them into their internal and customer-facing apps and products.Devgan pointed to Apple's efforts with their own smartphone chips, and Google's custom AI silicon as leading examples, and said the trend of system companies doing their own chips \"is only going to accelerate,\" he said.The company said it expects $5.9 billion to $6 billion in revenue for the next fiscal year, at the top end of FactSet's $5.94 billion expectation.Cadence competes with other companies that sell chip design software, including Synopsys and Siemens.Read more CNBC tech newsSnap to launch creator subscriptions in push to diversify revenueAlibaba unveils Qwen3.5 as China's chatbot race shifts to AI agentsByteDance says it will add safeguards to Seedance 2.0 following Hollywood backlashAnthropic got an 11% user boost from its OpenAI-bashing Super Bowl ad, data shows",

    "body": "watch nowOil prices rose more than 4% on Wednesday, after Vice President JD Vance said Iran did not address U.S. red lines in nuclear talks this week and President Donald Trump reserves the right to use military force.U.S. crude oil rose $2.86, or 4.59%, to close at $65.19 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent was up $2.93, or 4.35%, to settle at $70.35 per barrel. U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the discussions as \"constructive,\" according to Iranian media.  Araghchi said the talks yielded a general agreement on guiding principles.Oil prices closed lower Tuesday as traders interpreted the foreign minister's comments as a sign that the U.S. and Iran could still reach a settlement. But Vance said Tehran had failed to address core U.S. demands. \"In some ways it went well, they agreed to meet afterwards,\" the vice president told Fox News on Tuesday evening. \"But in other ways it is very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.\"Trump reserves the right to use force if diplomacy does not succeed in stopping Iran's nuclear program, Vance said. \"We do have a very powerful military — the president has shown a willingness to use it,\" the vice president told Fox News. Sources told Axios, meanwhile, that a U.S. military campaign against Iran would likely be massive, last weeks and look more like a full-fledged war than the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January. Iran's Revolutionary Guard conducted war games this week in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade choke point for global oil flows. About one-third of all waterborne crude exports pass through the narrow waterway, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. The market is worried those oil flows would be disrupted if the U.S. and Iran go to war. Iranian state media said traffic in part of the strait was closed Tuesday due to the military exercises. Kpler did not observe any halt in traffic in the strait on Tuesday, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at the firm.Trump has stationed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Middle East. The USS Gerald Ford is en route to the region.Trump said Friday he deployed the second aircraft carrier in case negotiations fail. \"If we don't have a deal, we'll need it,\" the president told reporters outside the White House. The Iranian government did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "BAE Systems attracted record orders in 2025, and now the UK defense staple is setting its sights on years of growth amid a global ramp-up in spending.Its shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday after its full-year earnings report showed sales soared 10% last year to reach a record £30.7 billion ($41.7 billion).That helped push operating profits to £2.93 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase, as revenues grew 8% to £28.3 billion.The FTSE 100-listed company, which manufactures a range of aircraft, weapons, munitions and warships, saw its order backlog hit £83.6 billion, a £5.8 billion increase from 2024. Now, BAE is preparing to capitalize on years of future growth as geopolitical fissures usher in what CEO Charles Woodburn called a \"new era of defense spending\" driven by \"escalating security challenges.\"The company expects sales to grow by between 7% and 9% in 2026, with guidance for cumulative free cash flow between 2026 and 2028 in excess of £6 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBAE Systems.\"We're well positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future,\" Woodburn said in a statement accompanying Wednesday's earnings.\"With a record order backlog and continuing investment in our business to enhance agility, efficiency and capacity, we're confident in our ability to keep delivering growth over the coming years.\"BAE Systems' share price is up 22.6% year-to-date, and more than 57% over the past 12 months.Last year, the company secured £36.8 billion of orders. Highlights included a £4.6 billion deal between the UK and Turkey for 20 Typhoon aircraft and an associated weapons package, as well as a £10 billion agreement with Norway's government to provide Type 26 frigates for its warship program. It also secured a $1.2 billion contract to provide space-based missile-tracking capabilities and other satellite equipment to the U.S. Space Force.Bernstein analysts recently named BAE Systems as one of four European defense stocks that will be critical to the growing push for greater military sovereignty in the region, as nations there turn to continental suppliers for arms and equipment and away from U.S. manufacturers.—CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to journalists aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea on October 29, 2025 in Japan.Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has welcomed Japan's pledge to invest nearly $36 billion in oil, gas and critical mineral projects in Texas, Ohio and Georgia. The commitment represents the first tranche of investments by Japan following a landmark trade deal between the two countries, one in which Tokyo pledged to invest $550 billion in American-based projects and Trump cut tariffs on most Japanese imports to 15%.\"Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!\" Trump said Tuesday in a social media post.\"The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS,\" he added. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said the projects strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and were expected to bring increased sales and business expansion for Japanese companies.\"We believe these initiatives truly embody the purpose of this Strategic Investment Initiative, namely the promotion of mutual benefit between Japan and the United States, the enhancement of economic security, and the promotion of economic growth,\" Takaichi said in a post on X, according to a Google translation.By far the largest investment is a natural gas facility in Ohio that's expected to generate 9.2 gigawatts of power.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Portsmouth Powered Land Project, valued at $33 billion and operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank, would be \"the largest natural gas generation facility in history.\" Read moreThe White House said Japan would also finance a $2.1 billion deepwater crude oil export facility off the Texas coast. At full capacity, the Texas GulfLink project is expected to generate up to $30 billion in annual U.S. crude exports. Dallas-based energy infrastructure group Sentinel Midstream is developing the project. The Commerce Department said the third major project refers to plans to create a synthetic diamond grit facility in Georgia, with Japan set to invest approximately $600 million.The project is set to be operated by Element Six, part of De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond company. Diamond grit, dust and powder are critical raw materials in U.S. industrial manufacturing due to their exceptional hardness and wear resistance, the Commerce Department said, making the material to U.S. economic and national security.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTesla Europe announced plans to add xAI's Grok, an AI chatbot, to its vehicle infotainment systems in the U.K. and eight other markets across Europe.It remains to be seen if the addition of this technology will revitalize Europeans' interest in buying Teslas.Elon Musk's automaker saw electric vehicle sales in Europe decline by 27%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA. The decline for Tesla came as Europeans' continued strong adoption of battery electric vehicles. BEVs, the only kind that Tesla makes, represented 17.4% of the market across Europe in 2025 according to the ACEA. China's BYD gained market share across the continent with innovative, and more affordable, EV models.Tesla's lack of affordable new models last year, and an ongoing consumer backlash in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, and endorsements of anti-immigrant extremists including Tommy Robinson in the U.K. and Germany's AfD party weighed on the appeal of the Tesla brand last year, according to Brand Finance. Tesla is not the only automaker integrating chatbot features into its infotainment systems. For example, Volvo has announced plans to add a Google Gemini-based conversational AI assistant to its EX60 electric vehicles. During a fourth-quarter earnings update, Tesla revealed that it had invested $2 billion into Musk's xAI.After that, Musk's aerospace and defense juggernaut, SpaceX, acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Before those deals, xAI had merged with social network X (formerly Twitter), and its Grok product had become the subject of myriad regulatory probes in Asia, Australia and throughout Europe including by regulators in Ireland, the U.K., France and the European Commission.As CNBC previously reported, Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake explicit images based on photos or clips of real people without their consent, including deepfake images depicting child sexual abuse. Last summer, Grok generated and spread antisemitic hate speech across social network X and praised Adolf Hitler, drawing earlier regulatory probes by the European Commission.A Tesla owner in Canada raised the alarm about Grok's lack of safeguards after it was added to her vehicle. As CBC reported, her son used Grok to generate entertaining comments about soccer athletes, and Grok eventually asked the minor to send nudes. Tesla and xAI have not said whether they can limit minors' access to Grok in Tesla vehicles, or moderate outputs of the chatbot to be appropriate for minors by default.Besides criticism of Grok's lax safety guardrails, driver distractibility remains a point of concern.Mike Nelson, who is a partner at Nelson Law and an automotive safety researcher, said his own Tesla Model Y features Grok in the U.S., and he has enjoyed using it. However, the addition of chatbot technology to vehicles' infotainment systems, he said, introduces a new \"distraction layer\" for drivers. \"Research shows that even in hands-free mode, you are more distracted when you are talking on the phone and driving,\" Nelson said. \"Adding Grok introduces more stimuli.\" A professor of machine learning and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, Rayid Ghani, told CNBC that researchers and regulators, and insurance companies especially, should hasten to conduct \"practical evaluations\" of chatbots.With a lack of benchmarking and standards across the industry, he said, \"we do not yet understand the information needs of drivers, how well Grok or other chatbots fulfill those needs compared to other options and whether chatbots may change driving behavior and exactly how.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Junior Achievement surveyed more than 1,000 teens between the ages of 13 and 18 in January.Of those polled, 68% said they plan to attend college, in line with recent years.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms ranked\"It's awesome to see that today's teens are optimistic about the future,\" said Jack Harris, Junior Achievement's CEO. \"In the face of AI, some form of post-secondary education is going to be very necessary,\" he said. \"We just have to be sure we are preparing students in the right way so that optimism doesn't fall flat.\"A mixed jobs pictureRecent data does show that the labor market is doing well. The U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The overall unemployment rate edged down to 4.3% — but for younger workers, ages 16 to 24, it's a different story. Among this cohort, the unemployment rate was 9.4% in January. There is a bit of a disconnect between \"teens that are a few years out and those just entering the workforce and having difficulty finding jobs,\" Harris said.Several large employers have said they're eliminating some entry-level positions, thanks in part to the rise of AI. Employers are projecting just a 1.6% increase in hiring for the Class of 2026 when compared to the Class of 2025, research by the National Association of Colleges and Employers also shows.Of course, some industries are more prone to disruptions than others. Entry-level jobs in technology and finance, for example, are at greater risk largely due to generative artificial intelligence, which can supplant a human's analytical skills, according to a report by Indeed. Alternatively, opportunities in nursing, manufacturing or construction are more insulated, for now, the report found.watch nowFears of an AI-driven, white-collar recession are already prompting a growing share of college-aged students to pivot. This year, more chose to get a two-year degree or even shorter-term credential to put greater emphasis on career training and post-college employment. The rising price tag of a four-year education is another significant factor driving more students toward short-term programs, other research shows.  \"It really depends on the student,\" said Jill Desjean, director of policy analysis at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. \"For some students, they know that this is the path they want to take, that a two- year or four-year degree is just not in the cards for them, for reasons other than cost.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks at a press conference at the Representation of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia about future visions for the development and application of artificial intelligence in education in NRW in Berlin on June 4, 2025.Soeren Stache | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesAmerican tech companies should \"worry a little bit\" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC.As competition between U.S. and Chinese companies intensifies to develop the most advanced models, Smith said that the U.S. has \"an advantage in terms of access to the most powerful chips in the world\" and \"other technology innovation.\"But, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, he also said: \"I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies.\"Chinese AI companies have been supported by their government with measures such as a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs. Smith's warning comes after Chinese firms released a slew of models over the past two weeks, and their lower-cost AI models could be attractive in developing nations.Smith said subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies were \"the fundamental approach that China successfully took to disrupt the telecommunications market,\" when state money and support helped companies like Huawei and ZTE expand.\"Some American companies disappeared. European companies like Ericsson and Nokia were thrown on the defensive,\" Smith added. Smith said data centers from Chinese firms Huawei and Alibaba exist around the world and \"it will not be difficult for China to subsidize those.\"\"I think for the rest of us, we have to compete with that, and we have to be good at competing with that, with the support of our governments,\" Smith said.CNBC approached Alibaba and Huawei for comment about whether they have accepted Chinese state subsidies but had not received a response as this article went live.Alibaba's cloud computing division, through which it sells its AI services, operates globally. But outside China, it doesn't always build data centers, instead partnering with other infrastructure players. How China supports its tech companiesBeijing launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.42 billion) national AI fund last year to invest in early-stage projects.Cities across the country, from Shanghai to the tech hub of Shenzhen, have offered \"vouchers\" to reduce the cost for companies looking to rent computing power.Cheap energy has been another advantage for Chinese companies that are trying to build out the power-hungry infrastructure needed to train and run AI models.Microsoft on Wednesday said it was on pace to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring AI to developing countries in the \"Global South,\" which includes investments in infrastructure and reskilling.Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist, told CNBC this week that a \"China tech sphere\" could easily form in developing countries.\"For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years' time,\" Green said.",

Timothy A.clary | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration was sued Tuesday over the abrupt removal of the Pride rainbow flag last week from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City, at the site of the 1969 uprising that ignited the gay rights movement in the United States.The lawsuit, filed by a group of LGBTQ+ advocates and a Greenwich Village community group, said the federal government claimed that Department of the Interior rules bar the flying of anything but the U.S. flags, DOI flags, and the POW/MIA flags in national parks.\"In fact, the opposite is true: The policies the government says require removing the Pride flag expressly permit the [National Park Service] to fly other flags that provide historical context to national monuments — which is precisely what the NPS official Pride flag did at Stonewall for many years,\" the lawsuit says.The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan a day after a federal judge in Philadelphia ordered the National Park Service to restore an exhibit at Independence National Historical Park that contained information about the nine slaves who lived with President George Washington in the official presidential residence in Philadelphia in the 1790s. That order will remain in effect pending the outcome of the city of Philadelphia's lawsuit challenging the NPS's removal of the exhibit in January.The Pride flag had flown at the Stonewall National Monument since 2022 after a flagpole was installed there.The monument is located across from the Stonewall Inn, where a July 1969 police raid of the then-underground gay bar was resisted by patrons, and followed by days of riots and protests.\"Before the 1960s, almost everything about living authentically as a lesbian, a bisexual person or a gay man was illegal,\" the NPS page for the monument says. \"The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.People gather in protest at the Stonewall National Monument after the Trump administration had the National Park Service remove the LGBTQ+ Pride flag from the site, which is considered the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, on Feb. 10, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe new lawsuit in Manhattan federal court called the flag's removal on Feb. 9 \"a textbook example of an arbitrary and capricious act.\"\"This was no careless mistake,\" the suit says. \"The government has not removed other historical flags at other national monuments, most notably Confederate flags. Meanwhile, the assault on Stonewall is the latest example in a long line of efforts by the Trump Administration to target the LGBTQ+ community for discrimination and opprobrium.\"New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, in a Feb. 10 post on X, said, \"I am outraged by the removal of the Rainbow Pride Flag from Stonewall National Monument.\"\"New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,\" Mamdani said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Sunday said he would introduce a bill to make \"the Pride Flag a congressionally authorized symbol.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airSchumer blasted President Donald Trump for what he called an attack on the LGBTQ community by removing the flag.\"We will not allow Donald Trump to engineer a crusade against the LGBTQ community and rewrite history,\" Schumer said in a post on X.An Interior Department spokesperson, in a statement to CNBC when asked about the lawsuit, said, \"Hundreds of families in New York City went without power during this year's severe cold weather, people are being found dead on the streets, and trash has piled up so high it towers over city residents.\"\"This is Mayor Mamdani, Senator Schumer and the congressional delegation's New York City,\" the spokesperson said. \"It would be a better use of their time to get the trash buildup off city streets, ensure there are no more avoidable deaths, and work to keep the power on for the people of New York City.\"\"This political pageantry shows how utterly incompetent and misaligned the New York City officials and New York's congressional representatives are with the problems their city is facing.\"",

    "body": "watch nowMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushed back against the notion that the social media company made increasing time spent on Instagram a company goal.Zuckerberg was addressing a 2015 email thread in which he appeared to highlight improving engagement metrics as an urgent matter for the company.While the email chain may have contained the words \"company goals,\" Zuckerberg said the comments could have been an aspiration, and asserted that Meta doesn't have those objectives. The comments came during testimony in a landmark trial about social media and safety that's being likened to the industry's \"Big Tobacco\" moment.The trial, which began in late January, centers on a young woman who alleged that she became addicted to social media and video streaming apps like Instagram and YouTube. Lawyers later brought up evidence from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, which included goals to actively up user daily engagement time on the platform to 40 minutes in 2023 to 46 minutes in 2026. Zuckerberg said the company uses milestones internally to measure against competitors and \"deliver the results we want to see.\" He asserted that the company is building services to help people connect.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to the Los Angeles Superior Court at United States Court House on Feb. 18, 2026 in Los Angeles, California.Jill Connelly | Getty ImagesLawyers also raised questions over whether the company has taken adequate steps to remove underage users from its platform.Zuckerberg said during his testimony that some users lie about their age when signing up for Instagram, which requires users to be 13 or older. Lawyers also shared a document which stated that 4 million kids under 13 used the platform in the U.S. The Facebook founder said that the company removes all underage users it identifies and includes terms about age usage during the sign-up process. \"You expect a 9-year-old to read all of the fine print,\" a lawyer for the plaintiff questioned. \"That's your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?\" The company did not begin asking for birthdays at sign up until late 2019.Zuckerberg later responded to questions about documents in which the company reported a higher retention rate on its platform for users who join as tweens. He said lawyers were \"mischaracterizing\" his words and that Meta doesn't always launch products in development such as an Instagram app for users under 13.Meta CEO and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg arrives at Los Angeles Superior Court ahead of the social media trial tasked to determine whether social media giants deliberately designed their platforms to be addictive to children, in Los Angeles, on Feb. 18, 2026.

If the board wants to fire me, I could elect a new board and reinstate myself,\" he said, in response to remarks he previously made on Joe Rogan's podcast.During his interview with the podcaster last year, Zuckerberg had said he wasn't worried about losing his job because he holds voting power.Zuckerger said he is \"very bad\" at media.The CEO walked into Los Angeles Superior Court just before noon ET Wednesday.Meta CEO and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg arrives at Los Angeles Superior Court ahead of the social media trial tasked to determine whether social media giants deliberately designed their platforms to be addictive to children, in Los Angeles, on Feb. 18, 2026.

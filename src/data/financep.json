    "body": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, speaks during an unveiling event in New York, Feb. 26, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon's stock plunged 11% in extended trading on Thursday, dragged lower by market jitters around the company's $200 billion capex plans, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies. The forecast is a sharp increase from Amazon's capital expenditures last year, and it was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. The company reported spending roughly $131 billion on purchases of property and equipment in 2025, up from about $83 billion in the year prior.  Tech companies have laid out aggressive spending plans on artificial intelligence infrastructure since OpenAI ushered in the modern era of this technology with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, but at the start of 2026, those lavish commitments have only kept growing. Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday said it would spend up to $185 billion in 2026, while Meta last week said its capital expenditures could nearly double from last year to somewhere between $115 billion to $135 billion in 2026On a conference call with investors, Wall Street analysts pressed Amazon executives for more clarity around the spending blitz and when it could begin to pay off. CEO Andy Jassy said in prepared remarks at the beginning of the call that he was \"confident\" that company's cloud unit will see a \"strong return on invested capital,\" though he didn't say when it could materialize.\"Help us, get to that — get to your level of confidence in having a strong long term return on that invested capital,\" Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said to Jassy. Jassy said the company needs the capital to keep pace with \"very high demand\" for Amazon's AI compute, which requires more infrastructure such as data centers, chips and networking equipment.\"This isn't some sort of quixotic, top-line grab,\" Jassy said. \"We have confidence that we, that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital. We've done that with our core AWS business. I think that will very much be true here as well.\"Sales at Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.6 billion in the most recent period, beating analysts' expectations and marking the cloud unit's \"fastest growth in 13 quarters,\" Jassy said. AWS could've grown faster if it had more capacity to meet demand, \"so we are being incredibly scrappy around that,\" he said. The company's cloud unit added almost 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025, and AWS expects to double that power by the end of 2027, Jassy noted.Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked Jassy how he sees the AI market evolving from the current landscape, where it remains \"a bit top-heavy with a lot of the spend clustering around a few of the AI-native labs.\"Jassy said the AI market has become more like a \"barbell,\" with the AI labs on one side and enterprises on the other end, looking to the technology as a \"productivity and cost avoidance\" tool. The middle is comprised of enterprises that are in various stages of building AI applications, he said. \"That middle part of the barbell very well may end up being the largest and most durable,\" Jassy said.

    "body": "CEO Bill Barton of Bob’s Discount Furniture rings the Opening Bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 5, 2026. NYSEShares of Bob's Discount Furniture barely budged on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday after the company priced its initial public offering at $17 per share.That price was within Bob's expected range of $17 to $19 per share and valued the company at about $2.22 billion. The stock, trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BOBS, closed the day at $17.02, roughly flat. The Manchester, Connecticut-based company, which was founded in 1991, has grown to 206 showrooms across 26 states, as of Sept. 28, according to its S-1 filing. It plans to more than double that store count to over 500 locations by 2035, the filing said.In an interview with CNBC, CEO Bill Barton said that even in a slow housing market and during a time when consumers have hesitated to splurge on some big-ticket items, Bob's has seen demand for buying furniture across all incomes. \"People still need furniture, but in challenging times they are often looking for good value and we are the value leader,\" he said.Many of its customers are motivated by life changes, such as setting up a new apartment, buying a home, having a child or downsizing for retirement, he said.Barton said Bob's has seen more significant customer gains among higher-income households in recent years. About 27% of its customers have an annual household income of more than $150,000, and that part of the customer base is growing the fastest. He said that group is up by about 3% as a share of Bob's shoppers in the past two years.About half of its customers have an annual household income of more than $100,000, he said.Bob's is known for selling lower-priced couches, rugs, dining room tables and other furniture. It has an average order value of about $1,400 per transaction, excluding sales at its outlets, according to its S-1 filing. The retailer estimates its prices are on average about 10% lower than its value-focused furniture competitors' lowest promoted prices or about 20% to 25% below their listed prices.To keep prices low, the company said it relies on a \"curated merchandising strategy, longstanding sourcing relationships and efficient supply chain,\" according to the filing. It carries roughly one-third fewer items than value-oriented competitors, but orders in larger quantities, the filing said.It's also tried to stand apart from other furniture retailers with quicker deliveries. Instead of customers waiting for weeks or months, most purchases can be delivered in as few as three days, the company said in the filing. With its new locations, Bob's plans to add to both existing and new markets, Chief Financial Officer Carl Lukach told CNBC. It plans to open stores in regions where it already has high density, such as in the Midwest and the New England area, but also expand to new states this year, including South Carolina and Tennessee. Initial public offerings in the U.S. are expected to gain momentum this year, as waning inflation and interest rate cuts are expected to nudge late-stage private companies off the sidelines, according to a report by consulting firm PwC. They'll build on a decent past year for IPOs, too. Traditional IPOs raised $33.6 billion in 2025, which represented the best year since 2021.This year, IPO activity may be led by artificial intelligence infrastructure, insurance and specialty risk companies, and AI-enabled software platforms, according to PwC. Industrials and manufacturing, including reshoring, aerospace and defense, and energy or grid-related infrastructure have gotten higher interest, too.One of the widely anticipated IPOs this year is of Elon Musk's company SpaceX. News of the potential IPO broke in December and Musk called reports about the planned offering \"accurate.\"",

    "body": "Big Tech companies have seen over $1 trillion wiped from their market cap over the past week, as fears over AI spending sparked a sell-off.Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet all saw their shares fall in the week up to market close on Thursday, as the companies' earnings reports signaled huge continued capex spending from hyperscalers.Amazon was down 7% in premarket trading on Friday. Alphabet was 0.7% lower, Meta was largely unchanged, while Oracle, Nvidia and Microsoft were up in the low single-digit percentages.Plans to funnel $660 billion into AI this year were announced by Big Tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, a figure higher than the GDP of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel. Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI buildout will likely encounter continued volatility as \"sentiment contagion takes hold,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC.\"Questions over the extent of capex as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,\" he added.'Investors questioning every angle in AI race'Amazon was among the firms announcing the biggest capex spending plans this earnings season. \"The key focus of [Amazon's] results was the capex guide of $200bn, up +56% on the year, ahead of market expectations and the highest amongst the hyperscalers,\" Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning, adding that the spend was predominantly for its cloud unit, AWS. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAmazon shares over the past monthWhile management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, she added. \"We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race.\"Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as \"staggering\" demand for the iPhone. — CNBC's Elsa Ohlen also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., is seen in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesSen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Thursday that she had refused to sit for a requested interview with the Department of Justice for its investigation over a video in which she and five other Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. troops not to follow illegal orders.\"I'm not going to be sitting down for this inquiry. I'm not going to legitimize their actions,\" Slotkin said in a videotaped statement she posted on X.Slotkin's lawyer also sent letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, informing them of her noncompliance, and asking Bondi to order Pirro to drop the probe.The lawyer, Preet Bharara, urged Pirro to retain her records because of \"anticipated litigation concerning potential violations of the Senator's First Amendment rights and your office's vindictive and retaliatory investigation.\"Bharara, in a letter to Pirro, said that the message of the Nov. 18 video featuring Slotkin and the other Democrats \"is uncontroversial and incontrovertible.\"\"It is therefore perplexing that the Department of Justice has begun an inquiry into the matter. For the reasons set forth below, our client will not submit to an interview in these circumstances and on this record,\" wrote Bharara, who previously served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.Pirro's office declined to comment on the letters. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ.Slotkin, in her video on X on Thursday, said that the Trump administration's aggressive reaction to her original video to U.S. troops resulted in a torrent of threats against her, her family, and her staff.\"To be honest, many lawyers told me to just be quiet, keep my head down, and hopefully this will all just go away,\" she said.\"But that's exactly what the Trump administration and Jeanine Pirro want.\"\"They are purposely using physical and legal intimidation to get me to shut up. But more importantly, they're using that intimidation to deter others from speaking out against their administration,\" Slotkin said. \"The intimidation is the point, and I'm not gonna go along with that,\" she said.In the Nov. 18 video, titled \"Don't give up the ship,\" the former CIA officer Slotkin and the other lawmakers deliver a straight-to-camera address to members of the U.S. military.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Slotkin said on that video.The others in the video were Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.The video was published as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs. The boat attacks — whose legality has been questioned — have resulted in at least 126 deaths since early September, according to The New York Times.President Donald Trump raged against the video, accusing the Democrats who appeared on it of sedition and treason, while calling for their arrest. \"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 20. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"In a subsequent post, he wrote: \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump, calling the video \"despicable, reckless, and false\" and labeling the Democrats the \"Seditious Six.\" The Pentagon initially said it was reviewing \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, and then later moved to cut his military retirement pay in retaliation for the video.The lawmakers in late November said that the FBI sought to interview them. Kelly filed a federal civil lawsuit against Hegseth and the Pentagon on Jan. 12 over his punishment for the video.On the same day, Slotkin told the Times that Pirro's office sent the Senate's sergeant-at-arms a request to interview either her or her private counsel.In a court hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's attempt to censure Kelly over his involvement in the video.

    "body": "Two armed members of Iran's police special forces stand behind a country flag placed on an armored military vehicle during a pro-Government rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 12, 2026. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to \"leave Iran now\" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  The U.S. has issued several similar security alerts over the past month. The Embassy last urged American citizens to leave the country in a warning on Jan. 14 as Trump was weighing options for a possible intervention in Iran, including targeted military strikes.The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran’s three main nuclear facilities.  Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.Little hope?The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a \"massive armada,\" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain \"far apart and there is zero trust,\" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. watch nowAs Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets. Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to the report. ",

The 18% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. will become effective after the joint statement is issued, he added.Two sides will then sign a formal agreement in mid-March, after which the tariff concession for U.S. goods entering India will become effective.Since the deal has been announced, the Indian government has been scant with details and is facing questions from opposition political parties. The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being \"compromised\" and of having \"surrendered on Tariffs.The Indian government has not confirmed some of Trump's claims about the trade deal such as India reducing duties on U.S. goods to zero and halting imports of Russian oil, as well as a firm commitment to purchasing goods worth $500 billion.Experts say Trump's claims seem \"unrealistic\" and risk the U.S. backtracking on the trade deal, citing his threats to raise tariffs on South Korea, after slashing them in July last year, despite a trade deal.",

Analysts expected 138 million DAUs.Roblox announced in its letter to shareholders that it no longer plans to issue annual guidance starting in 2027 due to \"inherent variability\" in the company's business. Instead, Roblox said it will focus on providing quarterly guidance. Roblox has faced criticism for putting underage users at risk, with multiple lawsuits on behalf of children who were sexually exploited on the gaming platform.The company said that late in the fourth quarter it began a mandatory age check for users looking to access communication features in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Roblox said 60% of its daily users in those markets had age checked while 45% of global daily users had done so.Roblox said the age-check rollout, which was completed globally in January, has caused \"a mid-single-digit headwind to engagement growth and a low-single-digit headwind to bookings growth.\" But the company added that \"the strategic upside is significant.\"\"Accurate age data unlocks a long-term opportunity to tailor features and content, increasing safety and civility, which in turn drives organic engagement growth,\" the company wrote.Roblox said it has found that the age checking has revealed its user base is younger than indicated by self-reported data. Among daily users, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, 35% are under the age of 13 and 27% are over 18. The company said it views its scale with young users as a \"valuable strategic asset.\"WATCH: Gaming stocks plunge on news of Google AI gaming toolwatch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Nov. 6, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced the launch of TrumpRx — a direct-to-consumer website that is key to his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. The president said millions of Americans would save money through the platform. But it's still unclear if all patients — particularly those with insurance coverage — will see more cost savings from using that site to buy their medicines than they would through existing methods. TrumpRx targets people who are willing to pay with cash and forgo insurance, which suggests that patients without or with limited coverage may benefit the most. \"You're going to save a fortune and this is also so good for overall health care,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night unveiling the website.The site does not sell drugs directly to American patients, but acts as a central hub that points them to drugmakers that are offering discounts on certain products on their own direct-to-consumer sites, or gives them discount coupons to take to pharmacies. For example, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were already offering their blockbuster obesity drugs at hefty discounts to cash-paying patients, even before the reductions Trump touted on Thursday.Clicking on the platform's offer for Lilly's popular Zepbound weight loss injection sends consumers to the company's LillyDirect platform, where they can order the treatment and submit prescription details.A screenshot of a Zepbound order on the TrumpRx website.\nPreview\nFilters\nSource InfoIn recent months, Lilly, Novo and at least 14 other drugmakers have negotiated agreements with the Trump administration to participate on the platform and voluntarily sell certain medicines at a discount to Medicaid patients. Those landmark deals are part of Trump's broader \"most favored nation\" policy, which pushes to link U.S. drug prices to the lowest ones abroad.At launch, the site features only medications from the first five companies to strike pricing deals with the administration: AstraZeneca, Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, according to a White House fact sheet. It will list drugs from other companies \"in the coming months,\" the administration said.The platform is the government's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations — and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.But TrumpRx \"doesn't seem like it is the only solution\" to that issue for most Americans, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization. The cash-pay offerings could be better deals for patients without insurance, but it's difficult to assess exactly how many people stand to benefit from TrumpRx, she added. \"If they're able to get a drug covered by their insurance at a relatively affordable copay, then there's not a great upside to using the TrumpRx website,\" Cubanski said. She said people with insurance coverage who buy through direct-to-consumer platforms may also not have their purchases count toward their benefits, which means it doesn't help them meet their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. But Cubanski said there's potential for TrumpRx to be helpful in expanding access to certain drugs at more affordable prices, particularly medicines not covered widely by insurance in the U.S., such as obesity drugs. Medicare will start covering weight loss treatments for the first time later this year as part of the deals Lilly and Novo struck with Trump, but many employers are still hesitant to cover those drugs. Still, many of the other products expected to be listed on TrumpRx are already widely covered through insurance, and some are available as cheaper generics from competing drugmakers. Questions about savingsQuestions remain about how much savings people can expect if they buy their medicines at direct-to-consumer prices. The announced price reductions for certain drugs are framed as steep cuts from their so-called retail list prices. For example, under Novo Nordisk's agreement with the administration, some doses of its diabetes drug Ozempic will be priced at $350 per month on TrumpRx, which is less than half of its roughly $1,000 monthly list price. But those list prices are often far higher than what private insurers and government programs ultimately pay for medicines after rebates, discounts and other concessions, according to researchers at Georgetown's Medicare Policy Initiative. That suggests some payers may already be securing prices comparable to — or lower than — the newly announced discounts on medications under the Trump deals. The Georgetown researchers cited one study that found that average discounts on brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D run around 40% of list prices. Meanwhile, discounts in Medicaid exceed 75%, according to a Congressional Budget Office study. In the private sector, \"we've got insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiating lower prices and designing an insurance benefit that enables people to benefit from those price negotiations,\" said KFF's Cubanski. \"My guess is that for most drugs, at least most brand-name medications, people are likely to get a better deal using their insurance rather than purchasing a drug through a direct-to-consumer website,\" she said. Drugs on TrumpRxAt the launch of the site, the administration listed a range of major drugs as available for discounts, with a particular emphasis on popular GLP-1 products:Ozempic injection for diabetes, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,000Wegovy injection for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,350Wegovy pill for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: $149 per month for the starting dosesZepbound injection for obesity, made by Eli Lilly: starting at $299 per month, down from $1,086The White House also put an emphasis on cash-pay discounts for fertility drugs like Gonal-F from EMD Serono, which was listed at $168. Dozens of other drugs that companies expected to be be listed on the platform were not as of Thursday night. Those include key treatments from companies including Amgen, Merck and Gilead, among others.In an interview with CNBC at a conference in January, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has multiple products on its existing direct-to-consumer platform, which first offered a cash-pay discount on its blood thinner Eliquis. That platform will eventually link to TrumpRx, he said. The company is going to examine ways to put additional products in its portfolio on its own platform, \"where it makes sense,\" Boerner added. He said Bristol Myers is \"aligned with the administration\" on the issue of the U.S. health care system being too complex, and said several middlemen can increase costs. \"What we like about these [direct-to-consumer models], where they make sense from a business standpoint, is you're able to circumvent some of that,\" Boerner said. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNBC last week, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients, and that TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" Ricks said.",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesBitcoin bounced off its recent low on Friday after narrowly avoiding falling below the key $60,000 mark, but some market commentators suggested there's more selling to come.Late on Thursday, the world's biggest cryptocurrency fell below $61,000 and hovered just above the $60,000 mark. As of 4:54 a.m. ET on Friday, Bitcoin was recovering slightly, trading at $66,015. A number of factors have contributed to the bitcoin bear market, which began after bitcoin hit a record high above $126,000 in October. Why is bitcoin falling?The sell-off comes amid a continued drop in tech stocks in the U.S. Bitcoin has often been correlated with risk assets like tech stocks in the U.S. and fall when they do. Meanwhile, other assets such as gold and silver have been very volatile, adding to turmoil in the markets.Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to push the crypto market lower. On Thursday, there were more than $2 billion worth of long and short positions on crypto that were liquidated, according to Coinglass data. That figure was almost $800 million on Friday.Meanwhile, there are signs that large institutional investors are selling their holdings. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoinU.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.\"Institutional investors are really unwinding their cryptocurrency holdings,\" Markus Thielen, head of research at 10X Research, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East.\"Thielen said that the average price people paid for bitcoin via an ETF is $90,000, and those investors are \"materially in losses now.\" \"These large outflows [are] during U.S. trading hours with those investors throwing in the towel,\" he added. How low can bitcoin go?Bitcoin now sits more than 40% off its all-time high. Other digital coins have fared worse. Ether and XRP are more than 60% lower than their record highs, while Solana is off by more than 70%. Market analysts said that bitcoin's drop below $70,000 could signal further downside. watch nowMeanwhile, 10X Research estimates bitcoin could go as low as $50,000, after a potential small bounce soon, Thielen said.\"I think we are going to have a little counter-trend rally that might go sideways or bounce a little bit,\" Thielen said. \"But I think during the summer we make another low.\"",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLayoff plans hit their highest January total since the global financial crisis while hiring intentions reached their lowest since the same period, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs for the month, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025. The total marked the highest for any January since 2009, while the economy was in the final months of its steepest downturn since the Great Depression.At the same time, companies announced just 5,306 new hires, also the lowest January since 2009, which is when Challenger began tracking such data. The crisis recession officially ended in March 2009.With the recent narrative centering on a no-hire, no-fire labor market, the Challenger data suggests that the layoff part of the equation could be stepping up.\"Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for the firm. \"It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.\"To be sure, if employers are stepping up plans to furlough workers, it hasn't been showing up much in official government data. watch nowHowever, initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 31 totaled a seasonally adjusted 231,000, the highest since early December though the spike likely had something to do with a brutal winter storm that hit large parts of the country. The longer-term trend still was at its lowest since October 2024.Some high-profile layoff announcements have boosted fears of wider damage in the labor market. Amazon, UPS and Dow Inc. recently have announced sizeable job cuts. Indeed, transportation had the highest level from a sector standpoint in January, due largely to plans from UPS to cut more than 30,000 workers. Technology was second on the back of Amazon's announcement to shed 16,000 mostly corporate level jobs.Planned hiring dropped 13% from January 2025 and was off 49% from December.Challenger data also can be volatile and not correlated to official statistics. However, filings with the Labor Department in January under Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification regulations indicate more than 100 companies have given notice of significant layoffs.In a separate report Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings fell sharply in December to 6.54 million, a slide of 386,000 on a monthly basis and down more than 900,000 from the October level. Openings are now at their lowest since September 2020.The decrease in available positions put the ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers at 0.87 to 1, down from more than 2 to 1 at its peak in mid-2022.  On Wednesday, ADP reported that private employers added just 22,000 jobs in January.watch now",

    "body": "Stellantis logo is pictured at one of its assembly plants following a company's announcement saying it will pause production there, in Toluca, state of Mexico, Mexico April 4, 2025. Henry Romero | ReutersShares of automaker Stellantis plunged 27% in European trading on Friday, after the company said it expects to take a 22-billion-euro ($26 billion) hit from a business reset and hinted at a pull-back from its electrification push. By 12:57 p.m. in Milan, the company's Italian shares were 27% lower. In premarket trading on Wall Street, the transatlantic firm's New York-listed stock plummeted 26.5%. Other French auto stocks also fell Friday morning, with Valeo and Forvia both down more than 1.2% and Renault sliding 2%.\"The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers' real-world needs, means and desires,\" said Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa in a statement.\"They also reflect the impact of previous poor operational execution, the effects of which are being progressively addressed by our new Team.\"Going forward, Stellantis said it would remain at the forefront of EV development, but said its own electrification journey would continue at \"a pace that needs to be governed by demand rather than command.\"watch nowStellantis also pre-released some figures for the fourth quarter on Friday, saying it anticipates a net loss for 2025. In recognition of that net loss, it has suspended its dividend for 2026 and plans to raise up to 5 billion euros by issuing hybrid bonds.For 2026, the auto giant is targeting a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit increase in its adjusted operating income margin.The company said its dividend pause and bond issuance would help preserve its balance sheet, and outlined the actions it had taken last year as part of its reset strategy. These included announcing \"the largest investment in Stellantis' U.S. history\" — totalling $13 billion over four years — as well as launching 10 new products, canceling products that could not achieve profit at scale, and restructuring its global manufacturing and quality management capabilities. Under the U.S. investment drive, the transatlantic automaker has said it will add 5,000 jobs to its American workforce. While these moves had resulted in costs of 22.2 billion euros, the company said they had collectively delivered a return to positive volume growth in 2025. In the second half of the year, Stellantis' U.S. market share rose to 7.9%, while the company said it retained its overall second-place market share position in the enlarged Europe. Stellantis' writedown follows multibillion-dollar hits at rivals Ford and GM, which recently announced their own hits worth $19.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively — both being related to EV pullbacks. Given the \"magnitude of the kitchen sinking\" and the soft 2026 guidance, UBS analysts said the negative share-price reaction was expected. They added, however, that new management's \"decisive\" clean-up and solid regional market fundamentals leave the stock attractive as a potential U.S. \"comeback\" play.'Year of execution'Friday's writedown announcement came alongside news that Stellantis will offload its stake in NextStar Energy, a joint venture with LG Energy Solution that built and operated a Canadian battery manufacturing facility. LG Energy Solution will take over Stellantis' 49% stake, the firms said on Friday morning. The joint venture was part of Stellantis' broader electrification strategy. In 2022, former CEO Carlos Tavares set a goal for 100% of sales in Europe and 50% of sales in the U.S. to be battery electric vehicles  by the end of the decade.The company is set to present an updated long-term strategy at its Capital Markets Day in May. Stellantis' stock has been under pressure for some time, with its Italian shares slumping nearly 25% last year and 40.5% the previous year. Shares are currently down more than 13% since the beginning of 2026. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis share priceFilosa previously dubbed 2026 the \"year of execution\" for the embattled automaker, which has been grappling with falling sales, leadership changes and disappointing earnings for several years. In July, the company said it expected to take a tariffs hit of around 1.5 billion euros in 2025, as it reported a first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros.In a Friday note, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Stellantis had placed a \"miscalculated bet\" on electric vehicles – but said the broader picture on EV adoption raised questions about Stellantis' marketability.\"The long-held argument about why many drivers won't go electric yet are concerns about price, access to charging infrastructure, and how long a battery will last during their journey,\" he said.\"However, prices are coming down, more chargers are being installed, and battery range is improving. The success of companies like BYD suggests there are plenty of people willing to take the leap. That begs the question as to whether Stellantis' frustration over its EV sales is linked to market issues or that drivers simply don't like its vehicles.\"Stellantis is scheduled to publish its 2025 earnings in full on Feb. 26.

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesThis tax season, some families could see a bigger tax break for their children due to changes from President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"Enacted in July, Trump's legislation permanently increased the maximum child tax credit to $2,200 per child for 2025, up from $2,000. That value will be indexed for inflation starting in 2026.  If you previously qualified for the full $2,000 credit, the update could trigger a $200 bigger refund or a $200 lower tax bill per kid, for your 2025 return, depending on your situation, experts say.     Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

What to expectAs ACA subsidies expire, health costs emerge as top economic worry for votersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedIn 2025, some 90% of families with children received the child tax credit, and the average tax break per family was $2,520, according to the Tax Policy Center.Nearly 37 million returns claimed the child tax credit or credit for other dependents during tax year 2022, based on the latest IRS estimates.Here are some key things to know about the tax break, including who qualifies and how to calculate your credit. Who qualifies for the child tax credit  Families must meet certain rules to claim the child tax credit, including age, relationship, support, residence requirements and more.  Kids must have a valid Social Security number and be under age 17 at the end of 2025. If a married couple filing jointly claims the credit, one filer also must have a Social Security number. The IRS outlines other guidelines here. The child tax credit starts to phase out, or get smaller, once income exceeds $200,000 for single filers or $400,000 for married couples filing taxes together. \"It's not based on any expenses you incur,\" Margot Crandall-Hollick, a principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told CNBC. \"It's based on your earnings … and if you have a kid that qualifies.\"  By comparison, another tax break for families, known as the child and dependent care tax credit, partially reduces up to $6,000 of care expenses for two or more \"qualifying individuals\" — typically children under age 13 — when parents who file taxes jointly both earn income. Families with a single qualifying individual can look to offset up to $3,000 of care expenses.watch nowHow the child tax credit worksFor 2025, the maximum child tax credit is up to $2,200 per child. If the credit exceeds your taxes owed, you can claim the \"refundable\" portion, up to $1,700 per kid, which is known as the additional child tax credit, or ACTC. Many lower-income filers don't owe a tax balance.\"You get more benefit if you have some tax liability to make up that $500 difference,\" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida. His firm is ranked No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025.After the first $2,500 of earnings, the child tax credit value is 15% of adjusted gross income, or AGI, until the tax break reaches $2,200. Meanwhile, ACTC is capped at 15% of earnings above $2,500.The $2,500 earnings minimum and $1,700 refundability cap means millions of lower-income families won't receive the full $2,200 credit in 2026, according to a January analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Tesla continues to expand its footprint in China, with the Shanghai Gigafactory contributing significantly to the company’s global production capacity. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTesla remained a strong contender in Beijing's competitive electric vehicle scene, as the company's China-produced EV sales grew modestly in January from the year before, amid a broader industry slowdown.According to data published by the China Passenger Car Association on Wednesday, January deliveries from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory rose by 9% to 69,129 units, from 63,238 in January 2025.The latest January deliveries places Tesla in third place against other Chinese EV manufacturers. BYD was in the lead at 205,518 shipments, while Geely came in second with 124,252 units, according to the CPCA.Despite the rise in deliveries, there is little indication of an actual growth in demand for Tesla's offerings in China — the world's largest EV market.The company's January delivery figures reflect the total number of shipments from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which produces the Model 3 and Model Y for domestic and foreign markets in Europe, the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.New registrations in January for Tesla passenger vehicles — a proxy for sales — rose slightly in Europe, according to Reuters.Domestic price warTesla has faced stiff competition from a number of Chinese EV brands with more affordable offerings. In a separate report, the CPCA noted that the total sales of Tesla's China-produced EVs fell by 4.8% in 2025 — one of only two manufacturers in Beijing that reported declining annual sales from the year before.At around 235,500 yuan ($33,943), Tesla's base Model 3 sedan costs nearly three times the price of the base model for BYD's Seal, at around 79,800 yuan.Like other automakers, Tesla has sought to maintain its competitiveness in China through aggressive price cuts. According to its Chinese website, Tesla has begun offering five-year 0% interest loans, or seven-year \"ultra-low\" interest rate loans for orders placed before Feb. 28.\"We have [had] really intense price wars that have gone on, although the government and industry have called on automakers to not engage with aggressive pricing strategies,\" Abby Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility, tells CNBC.Despite these involutive price wars, China's EV market has slowed considerably.According to CPCA data, new energy vehicle sales, which include hybrid and battery-powered cars, grew by only 1% year on year in January - a fourth-straight month of slowing growth.The slowdown is projected to continue, as Beijing has slashed support for new EV sales. From Jan. 1, a 5% tax on new energy vehicle purchases was reinstated, after previously being exempted from the full 10% tax for more than a decade. New energy vehicles include battery and hybrid-powered cars.New regulationsTesla's challenges are further compounded by a recent announcement from Beijing which will effectively ban concealed door handles. On Monday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that from Jan. 1, 2027, all door handles on cars sold in the country must have interior and exterior mechanical releases.The announcement follows a spate of high-profile incidents in the U.S. and China, where EV occupants involved in road accidents could not be freed after their vehicles caught fire, as a result of power failures in the door-locking mechanisms.While automakers in China have a decent runway to ensure compliance with the new regulations, it remains to be seen how Tesla will adapt, given that flush door handles were first popularized as a signature design feature on Tesla's minimalist vehicles.Some analysts, like Tu Le, founder and managing director of consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, see China's new car door handle restrictions as likely to pose a \"decent sized headache\" for Tesla.However, Le said, China's new regulations will likely have little impact on most automakers.\"I think for lots of Chinese brands, this new regulation [will not] take them by surprise, because when regulators were drafting the new regulations, they consulted OEMs and industry experts intensively,\" Le added.CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.Correction: This copy has been updated to correctly reflect the name spelling of Abby Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility.",

Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesToyota Motor announced Friday that Chief Executive Officer Koji Sato will step down and be replaced by its Chief Financial Officer, Kenta Kon, marking the automaker's second CEO transition in three years.The leadership shakeup will take effect on April 1, with Sato assuming the position of vice chairman and a newly created role as chief industry officer. \"Under this new leadership structure, Sato will focus on the broader industry, including Toyota, as Vice Chairman and CIO, while Kon will focus on internal company management as President and CEO,\" the company said in a statement. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kon likened the switch to Sato becoming \"captain of the national team\" and Kon the \"club captain.\" Sato explained the change was made so he could focus on leveraging his new roles as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and as vice chair of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business lobby. Sato had been appointed CEO in 2023, succeeding longtime leader Akio Toyoda. Executive Vice President Yoichi Miyazaki will assume Kon's former position as CFO. Meanwhile, Toyota plans to make further board changes in June 2026, with Kon joining as a director and Sato resigning from the board.Profit outlook raisedToyota added that the leadership changes will help speed up decision-making amid industry challenges and accelerate its transformation into a more diversified mobility company.Sales revenue for the December quarter rose 8.6% from a year earlier to 13.46 trillion yen ($85.8 billion), beating LSEG SmartEstimates by about 10%. The estimates are weighted toward forecasts from analysts with stronger historical accuracy.Operating income fell 2% to 1.19 trillion yen, reflecting continued pressure from U.S. tariffs. The result still topped LSEG's mean estimate of 1.09 trillion yen.Shares were trading up 1.5% on Friday following the news.Toyota has been increasing its focus on electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, amid tough global competition.The company said Friday that electrified vehicles accounted for nearly half of its retail vehicle sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Sales were driven by strong demand for hybrid vehicles in regions such as North America and China.Toyota raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 11.8%, citing a weak yen and cost reductions to help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.",

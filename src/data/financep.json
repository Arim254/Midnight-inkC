    "body": "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, speaks to members of the media outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

    "body": "Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. In \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,\" which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Buffett eventually arrives at a challenge he used to pose to college students. Buffett would ask the students to consider a scenario in which, given a class of 300 or so of their peers, they could receive 10% of the lifetime earnings of five of them. Who would they choose — and why? And who would they sell short? The people you chose, he says, wouldn't necessarily be the best looking or the smartest or the most athletic. \"Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy,\" Buffett says. \"There is nothing impossible. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five.\" How to get on the listSo what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? \"It's luck, a lot of it. If you choose the right parents, you're rich when you come out,\" Buffett says. \"You've won the lottery — the ovarian lottery.\"But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. \"You can do it by being a good person, by reading a lot, by spending less than you take in,\" he says. \"I just told them you can spend 110% of what you earn once, and then you used it up. The rest of your life you're underwater.\"Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. \"Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out,\" he says. \"It isn't that it's impossible, and I give credit to people to do it. But do it the easy way.\"Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of \"selling himself\" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients.\"That's not crazy,\" Buffett says. \"Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale, attends an AI summit in Paris in February 2025.Getty ImagesThe founders of some of the world's most successful startups have been young: Think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom were just 19 when they launched their ventures.But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger.A new report released by global early-stage venture capital firm Antler, found that the age of founders of AI unicorns has fallen from a peak age of 40 in 2021 to 29-years-old in 2024. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. In 2014, the average unicorn founder was 30 at the time of launch, compared with 34 for those who reached unicorn status between 2022 and 2024.Several AI startups with young founders have been in the spotlight in the past year. Alexandr Wang, co-founder of $29 billion AI data labelling company Scale AI, is only 29-years-old. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs.In fact, Meta's former generative AI team, which was headed up by 65-year-old AI godfather Yann LeCun, was reorganized after its LLama4 AI model didn't perform well. This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. It was recently valued at over $10 billion.AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. Fridtjof Berge, co-founder and chief business officer at Antler, told CNBC Make It that the key qualities in founders have shifted to being able to \"move fast and break things,\" and \"continuously iterate and test and improve.\"Berge said: \"It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company.\" Corporate experience 'matters less'Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. \"I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure,\" he said. Fridjtoff added that it \"matters less\" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. \"You might not think with a blank-slate state,\" he said. \"I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training,\" he added. In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. Examples of rapidly scaling AI startups in 2025 were Mistral, Lovable, and Suno AI. And as Zuckerberg's own example proves, executing on a wild idea in a college dorm room can lead to phenomenal success.\"He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world,\" Berge said. Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers.Berge noted that while 20-somethings have qualities that allow companies to move quickly, leadership can often change hands as the firm matures. \"I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years,\" He added.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he'd prefer to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his position as top economic advisor, a statement that could change the dynamic in the race to see who will replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.During an appearance in the White House, Trump said, \"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today.\"\"I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,\" he added.Hassett has been considered a leading contender to take the central bank reins, competing closely with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and has indicated he will replace Powell when his term as chair ends in May. Hassett and Warsh are two of five finalists for the position, a group that also includes current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Turning to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, \"We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out.\"After Trump spoke, traders on predictions market site Kalshi raised their bets to a 60% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared with just 16% for Hassett and 14% for Waller. As recently as Wednesday, Warsh and Hassett were in a near dead heat.\"It is not certain this is a definitive signal — the President has given various signals at various times and appears to enjoy the drama of this Celebrity Apprentice season — but it does look as if the former Fed governor is for the first time the clear front-runner,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh, at 60%, leading Hassett, at 15%, and Waller at 13%. Traders are giving little odds to Bowman and BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder, the other two candidates considered finalists. Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.",

    "body": "Many people think that if they're determined enough — if they push themselves really hard — they'll be able to create better habits.Those people are missing an important piece to the puzzle of self-control, according to James Clear, author of The New York Times bestselling book \"Atomic Habits.\" Even if you're disciplined, you likely need to put yourself in environments that allow you to stay that way, free of distractions or opportunities to be tempted out of your habits-in-progress, Clear told \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\" in a Jan. 8 episode.\"When you look at people who exhibit high levels of self-control, the common pattern across them is not that they have higher discipline than the average person,\" he said. \"The common pattern is that they are in situations where they're tempted less frequently.\"If you're avoiding alcohol while doing Dry January for the first time, for example, you may not want to go to happy hour with your friends, where external pressures or fear of missing out could sway you. The goal is to stay away from temptation, not resist it.\"You don't need to try to be more disciplined. You don't need to wish that you were a person with more willpower,\" said Clear. \"You need to take a little bit of time to design an environment where you're not tempted as frequently ...

If you and your friends are regularly in situations that keep you from building your desired habit, you might want to speak transparently with them about your goals or find other ways to spend time with them, Clear recommended.\"And that's not necessarily saying I never see these people again, but maybe I only see them in pockets or in certain situations,\" Clear said. \"And then other people I'm trying to expose myself to more and hang out with more.\"You may be inclined to tell yourself that, if you mess up during your pursuit for better habits, you should just quit trying altogether. Instead, flip your self-talk to be more optimistic, Clear advised. Tell yourself that your efforts today will pay off down the line, for example, or that you can stay the course even if you slip up.A positive attitude can also help you better manage the stress that comes with lifestyle and habit changes, according to a 2023 report from the Mayo Clinic. \"A bad attitude and self-pity makes every problem harder,\" said Clear. \"And so you're just layering on another challenge to the already challenging situation.

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Education Department announced on Friday that it will delay the implementation of wage garnishment and other involuntary collection efforts affecting defaulted student loan borrowers.The department said the delay affects involuntary collections on federal student loans through wage garnishments and the Treasury Offset Program, which is used to seize some or all of borrowers' payments from the government, including tax refunds and Social Security benefits.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

Before that announcement, collections had been paused since 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Student loan borrowers who fail to make on-time monthly payments for more than 270 days are typically considered in default on their loans. At that point, the federal government has the right to seize up to 15% of borrowers' after-tax wages — as well as a portion of their Social Security income and entire tax refunds, where applicable — to repay the debt. Roughly 5 million borrowers were in default, and that number was expected to grow to nearly 10 million in the coming months, the Department of Education said in April. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization.After the initial announcement about collection efforts, the agency has changed course on the policy several times. In June, it paused the plan to garnish Social Security payments.Then in December, the department confirmed around 1,000 borrowers would receive notification of intent to garnish wages during the week of Jan. 7, with more notices to follow. On Jan. 7, Protect Borrowers sent a letter to McMahon cosigned by the NAACP, American Federation of Teachers and several other organizations, urging the department to \"immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers' wages.\"\"After months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people's hard-earned money directly from their paychecks simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement.— CNBC reporter Annie Nova contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "watch nowArtificial intelligence is no longer a narrow technology trade. It is reshaping energy markets, infrastructure spending, and portfolio construction. Investors who focus only on chips and software risk missing where the next phase of value is occurring, according to investing experts on this week's episode of CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\"Some of the trends and innovations driving the market, and the rapid scaling of companies, are tied to AI's physical requirements. Power, cooling, grid stability, and data center efficiency have become binding constraints. Just look at the stock price of Bloom Energy, which for years after its 2018 IPO struggled to eke out a return above its IPO price. Since last year, when its onsite fuel cells began being ordered furiously for data centers, Bloom has seen its shares shoot up over 500% and the company reached a market cap above $30 billion. Many opportunities are being created in small- and mid-cap companies for investors. Firms that once sat outside the market's focus are now \"very quickly moving up the cap table,\" TCW Group global head of distribution Jennifer Grancio said on \"ETF Edge\" on Monday. In many cases, these companies operate in narrow segments with limited competition, allowing fundamentals to improve faster than investor awareness. Energy reliability is the central issue. In recent years, as the cost of renewable energy sources came down and became competitive with fossil fuel sources, the market debated \"How much regularity could we get out of wind, or could we get out of solar?\" Grancio said. But AI has shifted the conversation since data centers cannot tolerate intermittency, requiring a constant supply of power to avoid unintended downtime.That reality has driven \"a huge shift towards nuclear,\" according to Grancio, including renewed investment in servicing existing plants and developing small modular reactors. These projects are spawning new suppliers and accelerating growth for specialized players that sit upstream of utilities and hyperscalers.Nuclear power ETFsFirst Trust Bloomberg Nuclear Power ETF (RCTR)VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF (NLR)Themes Uranium & Nuclear ETF (URAN)Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF (NUKZ) Global X Uranium ETF (URA) Efficiency inside the data center is equally critical. As AI workloads expand, cooling and power management have become the chokepoints. Investors are increasingly drawn to companies that are \"one or two in their field\" and \"the best at a certain technology\" particularly where alternatives are limited, Grancio said.The structure of these markets matters. In some cases, there are \"only a few providers\" bordering on oligopolies, Grancio said. That concentration creates operating leverage, but it also means missteps can be costly.Actively managed ETFs are gaining traction as a result. While passive indices can capture broad market returns and the indexes do add new companies as components as they scale, active strategies aim to identify them earlier and hold them through multiple phases of growth.But the risks can be significant. Some parts of the AI-powered ecosystems include \"small, financially weak companies\" that are leveraged to electricity demand, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck. \"That also means you get a lot of volatility along the way,\" he said on \"ETF Edge.\"As a result, he said no single AI theme should dominate an investor's asset allocation. \"You don't want to overweight them in your portfolio,\" Van Eck said.He described Van Eck's nuclear ETF as having traded at \"nosebleed levels\" last year before it came down to a more reasonable entry point for new investors.The ETF experts said that as investors bring the AI theme into their portfolio construction in a more targeted way in 2026, active rebalancing and clear risk expectations will allow investors to stay invested without chasing peaks or panicking at drawdowns.",

    "body": "Timon Schneider | SOPA Images | APCompany: Integer Holdings Corp (ITGR)Business: Integer Holdings Corporation is a medical device contract development and manufacturing company. Its brands include Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical. The company's Cardio & Vascular product line offers a range of components, subassemblies, and finished devices used in interventional cardiology, structural heart, heart failure, peripheral vascular, neurovascular, interventional oncology, electrophysiology, vascular access, infusion therapy, hemodialysis, urology and gastroenterology procedures. Its interventional cardiology portfolio is focused primarily on the design, development and manufacture of catheter and wire-based technologies intended to diagnose and treat cardiac disease. Its electrophysiology products include devices used by electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists for the treatment of cardiac arrythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.Stock Market Value: $3.01B ($85.78 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconInteger Holdings in the past 12 monthsActivist: Irenic Capital ManagementOwnership: greater than 3%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Irenic Capital was founded in October 2021 by Adam Katz, a former portfolio manager at Elliott Investment Management, and Andy Dodge, a former investment partner at Indaba Capital Management. Irenic invests in public companies and works collaboratively with firm leadership. The firm's activism has thus far primarily focused on strategic activism, recommending spinoffs and sales of businesses.What's happeningOn Dec. 18, it was reported that Irenic took a position of more than 3% in Integer Holdings and is calling for a board refreshment and the exploration of a potential sale of the company.Behind the scenesInteger Holdings is a medical device contract development and manufacturing organization (\"CDMO\"). The company acts as an outsourced design and development partner for original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. When developing new medical devices, OEMs typically outsource certain components to third parties, who then become responsible for those parts for the entire lifecycle of the product. Integer is the largest of such companies and the only publicly traded pure-play medical device CDMO. From an end market perspective, the company specializes in cardiovascular and neuromodulation applications, which are generally considered to be very high quality because of their interventional, and therefore highly sticky nature. Moreover, the stringent regulatory and FDA approval requirements for these markets create very high barriers to change. However, despite this strong market position and competitive moat, the company's share price has struggled, down nearly 40% in the past year.The catalyst for this downturn was Integer's most recent quarterly report, which disclosed that the market demand for three specific products fell short of the OEM's expectations, causing the OEMs to significantly reduce their orders from Integer. As a result, Integer is now facing an air pocket in growth from 2026. While the company typically targets 6% to 8% organic growth, 2026 is now projected to be between -2% and 2%. Despite management's assurances that this is just an air pocket and that growth will normalize in 2027, the stock plummeted in extended trading and in the days that followed. A development like this followed by the assurances of management generally does not result in a 40% decline in a stock. The nature of Integer's business brings along certain confidentiality constraints around critical information. So, while management can give assurances, they cannot give transparency into its pipeline or the identity of its customers, programs and platforms.On Dec. 18, it was reported that Irenic Capital had a position of more than 3% in Integer and is calling for a board refreshment and to explore a potential sale of the company. There are a few reasons why a sale makes sense here. First, as the only public pure-play medical device CDMO, Integer has no public comps and suffers from limited investor and analyst understanding and coverage. Second, as discussed above when a company is required to have opacity around its sales and customers, it is much easier operated and grown in a private setting. Third, public investors have limited information with which to analyze the company, where a private buyer subject to a confidentiality agreement would be able to perform diligence on Integer's products, contracts and pipeline in full detail, allowing them to underwrite future growth with greater confidence. This is not lost on Integer management. In 2024, they explored strategic alternatives and reportedly received bids at a premium to the share price at the time (estimated in the $110 to $115 per share range). While the company ultimately didn't pursue a transaction, as the stock subsequently rerated, the recent share price pullback suggests that private equity interest should remain at a meaningful premium to today's valuation. For example, Teleflex Medical recently announced the sale of its OEM business at approximately 4.7-times revenue and 16- to 17-times EBITDA. Integer's largest competitors, Resonetics and Confluent Medical, are both PE owned and were acquired at valuations exceeding 20-times EBITDA. Extrapolating these multiples to Integer, which currently trades at roughly 2-times revenue and 12-times EBITDA, would equate to an acquisition price north of $120 per share.In evaluating this decision, Irenic would like to see a board refreshment that would include directors with medical OEM experience and financial acumen. This would add needed experience in two areas integral in making a transformative decision like whether to sell or not. Even without a potential sale of the company, this is a board that needs refreshment. Of the 11 directors, five will have been on the board for at least 10 years by the next annual meeting. This includes the chair, Pamela Bailey, who has been on the board for nearly 25 years. Introducing some fresh perspectives could materially improve the board's ability to assess the potential options to maximize value for shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis.Irenic has significant experience in strategic activism, identifying companies that are struggling in the public markets and helping implement spinoffs and sales of businesses, often to private equity. Integer fits the firm's playbook perfectly. While we typically prefer an activist to weigh a standalone thesis against a sale path, it is hard to recall a company with less justification for remaining in the public market. With the nomination deadline opening Jan.21, Irenic's next steps – and whether the firm chooses to nominate directors – should emerge soon. However, while Irenic is more than capable of running a proxy contest, it has historically received board representation via settlements, and we would expect the firm to be looking for the same result here. Moreover, given Irenic's strategically driven approach to its engagements, we would expect the firm to de-emphasize its governance concerns should the current board initiate a formal strategic review and receive credible and value accretive offers.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Coolpicture | Moment | Getty ImagesAs you gauge how much income you'll need to pay for your living expenses in retirement, don't forget to consider how you'll cover unexpected costs.More than 8 in 10 retiree households — 83% — will face unplanned outlays in any given year, according to new research from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Among households that do experience unexpected expenses, the average annual amount spent across retirement is $6,000. Measured another way, the typical household will spend an amount equivalent to 10% of its yearly income.Yet many households don't have that available in emergency savings, according to the research. While roughly 58% have enough cash to cover unplanned costs for a single year, around 16% would have to tap their 401(k) or other retirement accounts and the rest — about 27% — would fall short even after using all their cash and retirement assets.\"About 40% of [retired] households do not have enough cash to cover even a single year [of unplanned expenses], let alone their whole retirement,\" the research notes. The research uses data from 3,427 retired households that have been part of the 2000-2020 Health and Retirement Study and the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, both from the University of Michigan.It's important to have some cash savingsWhile experts generally recommend nonretirees have three to six months of living expenses set aside as emergency savings in case of job loss or other financial shocks, that amount may look different for retirees — who must figure out how to stretch their savings across what may be a decades-long retirement.As many retirees struggle to keep up with prices that continue to rise, considering unexpected expenses is an important part of evaluating retirement readiness.\"That helps you plan for liquidity versus your income needs,\" said Anqi Chen, co-author of the report and associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research.While some households may struggle to set aside money, \"even small amounts of savings will help provide some sort of buffer for when these events occur,\" Chen said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

For example, about 45% of households with less than $50,000 in income face a rainy day or health-care shock in a given year, compared with 80% of those with $100,000 or more in income.\"This finding highlights the fact that households have some control over when and how much they spend,\" the report notes.Think in terms of 'access to cash for surprises'So how much should you have set aside? Depending on a retiree's individual situation, financial advisors may recommend anywhere from three or six months' worth of expenses to a couple of years — or a variation of those parameters. Much of it will depend on your individual situation.\"What we usually tell clients is to think less in terms of months of expenses and more in terms of access to cash for surprises — health-care costs, home repairs or family needs,\" said certified financial planner Joon Um, a tax advisor with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California.\"For many retirees, that ends up being one year of core expenses, adjusted for guaranteed income like Social Security or pensions,\" Um said.The right amount depends on health, housing, income stability and how flexible other assets are, Um said.\"Retirees with steady income and liquid portfolios may need less cash, while those with higher medical risk or less flexibility need more,\" Um said. \"The goal isn't to maximize cash. It's to have enough on hand to avoid selling long-term investments at the wrong time.\"In other words, if you don't have enough cash set aside, you could be put in a position of selling investments when the market is down.Avoid having too much in cashHowever, having too much in cash comes with its own risks, said Peter Lazaroff, a chartered financial analyst and CFP, and the chief investment officer at Plancorp in St. Louis.\"Any time a retiree has more than two years of expenses in cash, it's too much,\" Lazaroff said. \"From purely a mathematical standpoint, you're giving up too much of a return.\"The biggest risk to your cash is inflation, he said. The latest reading of the consumer price index showed an annual inflation rate of 2.7% in December. \"Your cash just becomes less valuable every year,\" he said. \"You're putting your purchasing power at risk.\"He recommends stashing your cash in a high-yield savings account — which right now generally earns more than 3% in interest, according to Bankrate — to help minimize the impact of inflation.",

    "body": "Elon musk and the xAI logo.Vincent Feuray | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Environmental Protection Agency closed a loophole this week that Elon Musk's xAI had exploited to rapidly stand up its first data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The company was able to avoid air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, which were mounted on trailers, as \"non-road engines.\"The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above \"major source thresholds\" of pollution. The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process. Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment. The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google.At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X.While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's \"temporary\" turbines.SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment.Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention. Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits.Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environment Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they aren't violating terms of their permits, and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi. XAI, which recently raised $20 billion from investors including Nvidia and Cisco, is currently being investigated in multiple jurisdictions after its Grok and X apps let users easily create and distribute deepfake violent and sexualized images of women and even children.WATCH: xAI closes $20 billion funding roundwatch now",

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 8% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity.In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a \"solid start\" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said \"one data point does not make a trend.\" They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess early demand for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug market. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity.In a Friday note, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said around 3,100 prescriptions for the Wegovy pill were filled in the first week of the launch, citing IQVIA data for the week ending Jan. 9. In the first week of the commercial launch of Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, around 1,300 prescriptions were filled, and roughly 8,000 were filled in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. The TD Cowen analysts cited somewhat different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. The analysts said around 4,290 prescriptions were filled for Novo Nordisk's pill during its first full week of launch, with the majority being for the starting dose of the drug. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. The analysts said that compares with the roughly 1,900 prescriptions filled for Zepbound during its first full week on the market. Assuming the Symphony data is accurate, the pill \"is already outstripping its injectable counterparts at the same stage of their launch,\" TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych wrote in the note. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. Nedelcovych said he wants to see the full picture on the direct-to-consumer channel, which holds \"significant promise\" for the pill's launch. Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements — no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water — that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small-molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions. watch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a \"Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health Roundtable\" in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries \"if they don't go along with Greenland.\" \"We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,\" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a \"most favored nations\" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with Trump.Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.\"I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,\" he said Friday.",

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)Buffett talks about almost everythingWarren Buffett and Becky Quick covered too many topics in the interviews that aired in a two-hour special on CNBC Tuesday evening for me to write a cogent summary.\"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" included discussions about his inability to find a big company to purchase for Berkshire Hathaway as its cash pile moves toward $400 billion, new CEO Greg Abel, his company's future and past, the difficulty of giving away billions of dollars, and the invaluable role of luck in his success. That's not a comprehensive list.Here, however, are some brief clips and quotes that caught my attention.  Buffett on what's needed to find good businesses: \"It doesn't take a genius, and it sure doesn't take any Greek symbols or anything like that to figure out what a business is worth... If (Greg Abel) quit at high school like some of our managers have, he'd still be as smart as he is.\"Buffett on the Sunday board meeting when directors considered his recommendation they name Greg Abel as next CEO: \"(Director) Steve Burke finally said, you know, 'We don't need to sit around for three months and peer at our navel or anything on this. This is the right decision.' And so they voted to do it.\"Greg Abel speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCBuffett on Berkshire's future: \"It'll always be moving somewhat, but it'll be mostly expanding. Occasionally, there will be things that disappear ... We will have companies that 50 or 100 years from now will not be viable in the economy of that world. But we'll have a whole lot more that developed over the years. And we can go wherever the country goes, and we can go with capital.\"Why being on a corporation's board of directors is the best job in the world:\"Being a director. I mean, it's the best job in the world. You get 250, 300, even up to 500 thousand dollars a year for doing something that's quite pleasant. Usually they give you the transportation, and they have cars waiting to take you around everything. And everybody's polite. And everybody'd love that job. I mean, who wouldn't?\"Why he gave up betting on horses when he was in high school: \"One of the first things you learn in horse racing is you can beat a race, but you can't beat the races... I had a couple of horses in mind, but I lost the money on the first race. And then I did the dumbest thing you can imagine... I just kept betting every race. And when I went home, I was $50 poorer, which was all I'd taken with me... I went to the Howard Johnson's, and I had a couple of dollars left. I bought myself a fancy meal and just sat there and thought about it and thought about it on the train. And that was the end of horse racing.\"Buffett on running Berkshire for decades:\"Everything I wanted to have happen has worked out... Doesn't mean that everything we've done has worked out. But I couldn't imagine more fun than I've had running Berkshire. And Charlie and I would have more fun out of the things that didn't work a lot of times than (if they) did.\"On being a teacher on the side: \"I loved it. It appealed to my didactic style, and I liked my own ideas... I just had fun teaching. And I still do, except I ran out of gas a few years ago.\"Advice for new parents: \"The only piece of advice I give to newlyweds is don't ever use sarcasm with your children. I mean, it may be sarcasm to you, but it's a lash across the back to them they'll never forget.\"Learning and evolving:\"You should be wiser in the second half of your life than the first half. And if you've -- if things have worked well for you, you should be a better person in the second half of your life.\"On being kind: \"I would just ask anybody to challenge me on whether being kind could hurt them in any way, and whether the happiness of the world wouldn't be better if ... every morning they said to themselves, 'I'll have things that are good and bad happen to me today, but I can be kind to anybody.'\"Warren Buffett Watch's exclusive clipEven though the special was two hours long, there was more interview than time, forcing the producer to make some difficult decisions.Here for Warren Buffett Watch readers is a clip that she wanted to get into the final cut. Buffett explains why he hasn't been speaking out on politics in recent years:BECKY QUICK:  You haven't commented as much publicly lately, either. You basically save it for the annual meeting when all the shareholders come into town.WARREN BUFFETT:  Right.BECKY QUICK:  Why is that?WARREN BUFFETT:  Well, for one thing, I made the statement a few years ago — maybe, I don't know, five or six years ago — somebody asked about taking a political stance. And I said that you don't put your citizenship in a blind trust. But —BECKY QUICK:  As a CEO.WARREN BUFFETT:  And — as a CEO, yeah.You have three or four hundred thousand employees, and you have millions of shareholders, but nevertheless you were entitled — I took the position — to speak out.But I think — I've revisited that opinion in my mind, because people will have — gotten so tribal. We saw it on our gifts program at one time.But there's no reason why somebody that's answering a phone at GEICO or waiting on a customer at the Nebraska Furniture Mart should be dealing with people who have a negative opinion of the company because of something I've said.And, you know, here I am — if I want to speak as a private citizen, I should resign from Berkshire.But I don't really want — I've got identified so much with Berkshire that I — as long as I'm speaking at the annual meeting or anything like that, people will associate it with the voice of Berkshire to some extent.And the employees don't deserve that. The companies don't deserve it. And so I backed away from that.Buffett's children on philanthropy and growing up BuffettBuffett has given his three adult children the extremely difficult talk of unanimously deciding how to give away his enormous net worth after he dies.When she was in Omaha to interview their father, Becky sat down with Howard, Susan, and Peter Buffett to talk about that assignment, their own philanthropic efforts, and what it was like growing up in Buffett's famously unassuming house.An extensive portion aired in the special, but this is the entire conversation:In this excerpt, they remember how their father got \"clever\" about giving them an allowance:HOWARD BUFFETT: You know, we'd earn this allowance for cleaning out gutters and cutting the lawn and raking leaves and stuff.But he — but Warren got pretty clever and he started giving it to us in quarters. And then he bought a slot —SUSAN BUFFETT: Dimes!HOWARD BUFFETT: Yeah.SUSAN BUFFETT: It was a dime slot machine.HOWARD BUFFETT: Yeah. And then he bought —SUSAN BUFFETT: He got it all back.HOWARD BUFFETT: And then he bought the slot machine, so he would get most of his allowance back. At least with me, he got a lot of it back.In his Inside Wealth report on Wednesday's \"Squawk Box,\" Robert Frank explained why Buffett's children may have the most difficult job in philanthropy:If you missed it\"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" will be shown again on CNBC this coming Sunday, January 18 at 3 PM ET and Monday, January 19 at 7 AM ET.BUFFETT & BERKSHIRE AROUND THE INTERNETSome links may require a subscription:Barron's on MSN: Berkshire missed the bank rally.

    "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado waves to supporters outside the White House following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on January 15, 2026 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNorwegian lawmakers reacted with shock and dismay over Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado's decision to present U.S. President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal.\"It's completely unheard of,\" Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international politics at the University of Oslo and former state secretary in the foreign affairs ministry, told public broadcaster NRK on Friday.She called Machado's gesture \"disrespectful\" and \"pathetic,\" saying it undermined the value of the prize, which the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards annually. Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "On my first day of work at the neighborhood ice cream shop, my boss lined up cups on the counter, handed me a scooper, and set a timer.\"A perfect scoop takes under 24 seconds,\" he said. Ice cream splattered as I tried to keep up. It humbled me, but I kept showing up. The pay is $16.50 an hour plus tips, and I — a 31-year-old with years of experience in news and tech — expected to be working alongside teenagers. Instead, when I started working at Lady Moo Moo in Bed-Stuy, I found myself surrounded by people who, like me, had already built careers and are now navigating an unpredictable job market. Some had been laid off just as I had. Others, like my colleague who is a sex educator and public health advocate, lost funding in their fields. A few are juggling multiple part-time roles to stay afloat. We're all piecing together income however we can, showing up where steady work exists. We have responsibilities and ambition. We're trying and adapting. There is zero shame in it. From leader to laid offMy life used to look very different. At 23, I was the U.S. news lead for ByteDance's first U.S. content product, TopBuzz. By 25, I oversaw content strategy at SmartNews, a Japanese news aggregation startup that once felt like the future of media.I still remember the 10th anniversary celebration. The company flew the U.S. team and several colleagues from Japan to San Francisco and put us up in beautiful hotel suites. The CEO opened a five-figure bottle of whiskey in front of everyone. The future felt bright. A few months later, most of the U.S. team, including me, was laid off. Talk about whiplash.In 2024, Meta offered me a job that was listed in New York, which has always felt like home. After I accepted, the role shifted to San Francisco. I was hopeful about this next step in my career when I moved west. But no one on my team worked in my building, I had five different managers, and I was laid off again after only a year.Courtesy of Kaila CurryThe toughest job marketI moved back to New York with part of my severance, assuming my experience, especially with Meta, would help me find work quickly. Instead, I stepped into the most brutal job search I've ever experienced. When I logged onto LinkedIn, my feed was full of people going through the same thing.After a long interview process at Yahoo, I didn't get the full-time role I'd applied for. But a month later, the hiring manager offered me a part-time weekend contract. I accepted immediately. It meant waking up at 5 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays and going without benefits, but I loved the work and wanted to stay in the industry.I figured a job at the ice cream shop in my neighborhood, which is open every year from April through November, might help fill the gap. A sweet side gigI never expected to get a scooping job in my 30s. I took it to make some extra money until I regained my footing. But I ended up finding so much more in it. At Lady Moo Moo, the line wraps around the block even on rainy days. On Halloween, a little girl dressed up as the shop's golden gumball. The basement is filled with gifts, drawings, thank you notes and even a paper mache cow a customer made.People come in after long workdays, school pickups, and difficult conversations, or simply because they want a moment of sweetness. I saw couples on dates, friends catching up, and neighbors stopping by because the shop is part of their daily rhythm. Every shift, I met people who never imagined they would be picking up part-time work: artists, teachers, nonprofit workers, tech employees, museum curators, and neighbors doing their best to make life work in a difficult economy. No one was ashamed. Everyone showed up for themselves and for each other.During our final week of the season, the owner took the entire staff out to dinner. I've worked full-time jobs with far larger budgets that never expressed appreciation like that. Walking home afterward, my arms sore from 24-second scooping drills, I didn't feel \"behind\" in my career. I felt grounded and grateful. I felt like I belonged somewhere again.Do I want another full-time role? Of course. I miss health insurance. I miss buying fresh groceries. I miss sleeping past dawn. But this experience gave me something I didn't realize I needed — and when the shop opens its second, year-round location in early 2026, I'll keep scooping while I continue my job search as long as my schedule allows it. In a moment when the job market felt chaotic and stability seemed elusive, I found steadiness in a community that held me up. It reminded me that life is about more than titles and résumés. It's about the places you go and the people you meet who show you that you're not alone — the ones who scoop beside you and turn a side gig at a small neighborhood shop into something that feels like home.Kaila Curry is a journalist, senior content manager, audience engagement and social media strategist and, most recently, an ice cream scooper.

    "body": "Many entry-level workers are having a tougher time finding jobs these days. LinkedIn is sharing one tip that could help.The professional networking site published a list of its predictions for 2026 on Dec. 16. One proclaims, \"The best career move for entry-level workers will be to start small.\" It predicts small businesses, defined as those with fewer than 250 employees, will be \"the top destination for young jobseekers in 2026.\"\"When you look at who's hiring by company size, what we're seeing is that small businesses still offer a lot of advantages for entry-level workers,\" Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn's chief economist, tells CNBC Make It. Small companies account for a large proportion of the workforce domestically and globally. The World Bank Group estimates small and medium enterprises constitute roughly 90% of all businesses and are responsible for more than 50% of global employment, as LinkedIn notes in its prediction. Entry-level and early-career workers also tend to make up a higher proportion of the workforce at small businesses than at larger firms. \"When you think of opportunities, that's the best way to start,\" Kimbrough says. \"That's where a lot of opportunity lies.\"The picture for entry-level workers has been bleak in recent years. Entry-level hiring is down 23% from March 2020, compared to an 18% decline in overall hiring over the same period, according to a May LinkedIn report.As of September 2025, the unemployment rate for both 20- to 24-year-old high school graduates without college degrees and 20- to 24-year-old college graduates with a bachelor's degree was 9.7%, according to data from the Federal Reserve, more than double the overall unemployment rate of 4.4% that month.\"You're facing a challenging job market where there are more applications for every job out there,\" Kimbrough says. \"Small businesses are the best on-ramp right now.\"At very big employers, the average share of entry-level workers is \"flat or shrinking,\" according to an October LinkedIn report on entry-level hiring. For workers just starting out, what matters is getting experience, regardless of the company's size, Kimbrough says.\"What's most important for new grads is getting their foot in the door,\" she says. \"If you're not getting traction in a very large company that isn't hiring as much as they used to, don't forget the small companies that are all around you.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Whether it from unexpected expenses or increased costs, many Americans say they are ending this year in a worse financial situation than last.Nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, and 24% say their credit scores took a hit in 2025, according to a survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults released Dec. 16 by Intuit Credit Karma, a personal finance platform. That's not surprising, says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. \"The cumulative effects of higher prices and higher interest rates have weighed on people,\" and it's showing up in data as well, Rossman says, citing increased late payment rates on loans, known as delinquencies.Yet, he says it's important to have a good credit score, not just because it allows you to access loans and credit cards, but also because landlords, utility companies, cell phone providers and even some employers may review your credit to assess your financial trustworthiness.If your credit score has taken a hit this year, there isn't much you can do to erase your history, but Rossman says there are steps you can take to rebuild your credit. Going forward, \"try to fill your report with positive info,\" he says.Strategies to increase your credit scoreHere are some examples of how you can add positive information to your credit report, according to Rossman:Pay off your balanceMake on-time paymentsHave someone add you as an authorized user on their accountSign up for alternative data reporting programsConsider credit-building productsThe first and best things you can do to increase your credit score are pay off your balance and make on-time payments going forward, Rossman says. Making multiple payments per period to keep your debts low can also boost your score, he adds.From there, consider asking someone with better credit, such as a family member, to add you as an authorized user on their credit card, he says. As an authorized user, the main account's positive payment history, age and low utilization can appear on your credit report, helping \"piggyback\" their good credit to boost your score, Rossman says.You could also sign up for alternative data reporting programs that report on-time rent, utility or subscription payments to credit bureaus, Rossman says, or look into safe credit-building products, like a secured credit card or credit-builder loan.Products that build credit can help if used correctly, but they also come with costs, potential negative reporting and limited impact in some credit scoring models. It's wise to compare costs and understand what is actually reported and to which bureaus, Rossman says.With any of these steps, it comes down to managing your cash flow and keeping the balance on your credit cards low, a metric called credit utilization, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia. Like paying off your balances, keeping your credit utilization low is another way to show lenders you can manage credit responsibly, which can help improve your credit score.\"Look at how much cash you have coming in and see where you can utilize some of the cash you have to lower the balance on some of the larger balances you may have,\" Tsantes says. \"That's going to lower your utilization and increase your credit.\" Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "When Chelsea Hirschhorn started her company, she didn't buy into the expectations of how a \"traditional founder\" would approach the business, she says. According to Hirschhorn, the founder and CEO of Frida, a fertility, pregnancy and infant product company, \"a lot of founders are celebrated for going fast and breaking things.\" However, her approach to building Frida was \"a little bit more measured,\" she told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on the latest episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast.Her penchant for \"organization and thoughtfulness\" doesn't hold her back, said Hirschhorn, a 2025 CNBC Changemaker. In fact, she considers it her superpower as a leader.Still, before launching Frida, Hirschhorn had to learn how to get comfortable with taking on new challenges.\"From a career perspective, I'm very ambitious,\" she said, but prior to starting her company, she described herself as \"pretty risk-averse.\"Hirschhorn worked as a bankruptcy attorney before she launched Frida. After a neighbor gifted her a NoseFrida, a Swedish nasal aspirator designed for babies, Hirschhorn saw potential in the product and decided to buy the neighbor's business selling the devices.In 2014, Hirschhorn launched Frida with the NoseFrida as its flagship product.It was a difficult decision for Hirschhorn to leave her previous career, she said, and she \"needed a lot of encouragement\" from her husband, who now serves as the president of Frida, to take the leap. True to form, Hirschhorn took a careful approach to scaling her business, and she decided from the beginning not to raise venture capital funding to build Frida.  Rapid growth was \"never our objective,\" she said.\"I approached the business building with a level of practicality and a measured pace, I think, that is not necessarily a reflection of a traditional founder,\" she said.That approach, along with a level of \"comfort with bucking the trend,\" have been consistent threads in her story as a founder, Hirschhorn said – and it helped her build a \"winning strategy\" for the company.How her leadership philosophy has developedHirschhorn described her current leadership style as \"empathic, transparent\" and \"informed by the stage of life that I'm in,\" she told Boorstin.When Hirschhorn first launched Frida, she was \"singularly focused on building the actual foundation for the business\" and prioritized \"achieving certain milestones\" in Frida's growth trajectory, she said.She led \"with the expectation that other people sort of follow my lead as far as the rigor and the work ethic and the commitment,\" she said.Since then, her leadership philosophy has \"evolved meaningfully,\" she told Boorstin. Today, she prioritizes empathy and strives to be \"comprehensive in my understanding of different people's motivations.\"Her leadership style has also been informed by her experiences as a working mother, she said.Hirschhorn is aware of \"the dynamics that mothers face and the trade off and sacrifice of personal and professional ambitions and time management,\" so she offers perks like weekly manicures and haircuts for her team. From the outside, those perks may not seem \"that significant or meaningful,\" she said, but they represent her commitment to prioritizing well-being.Follow and listen to every episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast on Apple and Spotify.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the start of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt.Student loan holders have been under pressure from a weakening labor market, a barrage of changes to the lending system and recent trouble accessing relief programs. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.This is a developing news story.

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. economy grew at a much greater-than-expected pace in the third quarter, boosted by strong consumer spending, a delayed report released Tuesday showed. U.S. gross domestic product, a sum of all goods and services produced in the sprawling U.S. economy, expanded by 4.3% in the July-September period, the Commerce Department said in its initial reading of third-quarter growth. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a gain of 3.2%.Consumer spending expanded by 3.5% in the third quarter after rising 2.5% in the second quarter. Increases in exports and government spending also boosted growth, while a smaller dip in private fixed investment helped as well.The report originally had been scheduled for release on Oct. 30 but was delayed by the government shutdown. This release also replaces a second estimate that was set to drop on Nov. 26. The department's Bureau of Economic Analysis will release one final estimate later.A measure of growth called real final sales to private domestic purchasers rose 3% in the quarter, up 0.1 percentage point from the prior period. Federal Reserve policymakers watch the data point closely for signs of consumer demand.The economy moved forward during the period despite persistent signs of inflation pressures.The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's primary inflation gauge, rose 2.8% during the period, and 2.9% for core which excludes food and energy. Both were above prior respective readings of 2.1% and 2.6% and remain well above the Fed's 2% inflation gauge. Also, the chain-weighted price index, which accounts for changes in consumer behavior such as switching to less expensive products for pricier items, rose 3.8%, a full percentage point above the forecast.Though the report presented a largely positive view of the economy, markets reacted little as the data is backward-looking. Stock futures were slightly negative while Treasury yields held higher.Elsewhere in the report, corporate profits soared by $166.1 billion, or 4.2%, compared with a gain of $6.8 billion in the second quarter.

    "body": "watch nowCitadel plans to return about $5 billion in profits earned in 2025 back to investors at the beginning of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The firm's flagship-multistrategy fund, known as Wellington, gained 9.3% in the year through last week, the person said, who asked not to be named discussing performance details. The profit being returned is not all that was generated in 2025, the person said, but rather, a way of constraining capital amid what the fund managers there perceive to be a limited opportunity set going into the new year. As such, Citadel will start 2026 with $67 billion in assets, down from the $72 billion it currently manages, the person said. A spokesperson for Citadel declined to comment. The firm does not opt for profit distributions every year, but since 2017 (and including what's expected to be given back this year), Citadel has returned $32 billion in profit to its investors. Citadel has been ranked the most profitable hedge fund based on net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Through 2024, Citadel has generated $83 billion in net gains since it was founded in 1990. It is anticipated that number will jump to more than $88 billion when the new rankings come out in January.",

The association said it's shaping up to be the cheapest December for drivers filling up their tanks going back to the pandemic year of 2020.Fuel prices are down about 7% from a month ago, AAA data shows, and have tumbled roughly 43% from mid-2022 highs near $5 a gallon that followed runaway inflation in the wake of the pandemic.The latest slide in prices comes as AAA forecasts a record of more than 122 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home in the 13 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 1. AAA found nearly nine of 10 people on the move during the period — or close to 110 million — are expected to travel by car.The drop in pump prices may help mitigate the impact of lingering inflation elsewhere during the holiday season.Just over 40% of those polled said they planned to spend less at the holidays this year, a 6-point increase from a year ago, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey.

Kim Hong-ji | ReutersShares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. watch nowLast week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe.

    "body": "Ted Sarandos, left, co-CEO of Netflix, and David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.Mario Anzuoni | Mike Blake | ReutersHours before Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix, Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, called WBD CEO David Zaslav to inform him Netflix wouldn't be bidding any higher. WBD shareholders now have a chance to call Sarandos' bluff.WBD shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash, though that deadline may be artificial. Paramount can extend it all the way to WBD's annual meeting, which hasn't been set yet but this year took place June 2. If Paramount acquires 51% of outstanding WBD shares, it would control the company, even though the WBD board already agreed to sell the company's studio and streaming assets to Netflix. Both Netflix and Paramount can use the coming days and weeks to speak with WBD shareholders to gauge whether they'd like to take Paramount's offer or stick with the board's recommendation to sell to Netflix. To tender or not to tender, that is the question. There are sound arguments for both sides. The decision also presents a game theory element for shareholders who may simply want a bidding war rather than caring about the right buyer.To tenderThere are two overarching reasons why a shareholder might tender their holdings to Paramount. The first is if the investor believes Paramount's $30-per-share, all-cash offer for the entirety of WBD is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for just the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO Max streaming business. The second is a belief that tendering shares is the best way to force a bidding war between Netflix and Paramount.A shareholder could decide Paramount's current offer is better than Netflix's if they think it has a higher likelihood of regulatory approval or if they believe Discovery Global — the portfolio of linear cable networks including CNN, TNT, Discovery, HGTV and TBS that's set to be spun out — will have minimal value as a publicly traded company. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison told CNBC earlier this month he values Discovery Global at $1 per share, given his prediction on the likely multiple (two times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at which it will trade based on current valuations for similar linear cable networks. If WBD doesn't agree to sell the entire company to Paramount, it plans to split Discovery Global out as its own publicly traded entity in mid-2026. Paramount's argument is that $30 per share is already greater than Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer plus $1 per share for Discovery Global. David Ellison, CEO of Paramount Skydance, exits following an interview at the New York Stock Exchange, Dec. 8, 2025.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersParamount's bid is also all cash, while Netflix's bid includes 16% equity with a so-called collar, which means shareholders won't know exactly how much Netflix stock they'll actually receive until the deal closes. As for regulatory approval, Paramount has played up arguments that a combined Netflix and HBO Max streaming business would be anticompetitive. Netflix has more than 300 million global paying customers. The idea of the largest streamer buying HBO Max has already raised concerns with politicians, including President Donald Trump, who said there may be a \"market share\" issue with a Netflix deal. While Paramount would combine Paramount+ with HBO Max, Paramount+ has about 80 million subscribers, presenting less of a risk to competition. The second, more nuanced argument to tender is to maximize upside even if the assets ultimately go to Netflix. Ellison has already made it known Paramount's $30-per-share offer isn't best and final. Tendering could cause Netflix to come back with a higher offer, which may then prompt Paramount to raise its bid as well. GAMCO Investors chairman and CEO Mario Gabelli told CNBC earlier this month \"the notion of Company A and Company B having a bidding war — that's what we like as part of the free market system.\" He added last week that while he was previously leaning toward tendering his shares to Paramount, \"the most important part is to keep it in play.\" Not to tenderOther shareholders may believe, in contrast, that not tendering is the best way of jumpstarting a bidding war. If Paramount sees that it's not getting traction with shareholders as the annual meeting gets closer, it may raise its bid to get more shareholders on board. There are additional reasons not to tender. Shareholders may want the Netflix and Discovery Global equity portion of the Netflix proposal. In a WBD filing last week, the company said a mystery \"Company C\" proposed to acquire Discovery Global and its 20% stake in WBD's streaming and studios business for $25 billion in cash. That bid was rejected by the WBD board as \"not actionable.\" Still, the mystery bid suggests there may be an interested buyer in all of Discovery Global if it gets spun out, which could result in far more than $1 per share, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. That's a good reason not to tender, he said, because it makes the Netflix offer much more valuable than Paramount's bid. Ensuring WBD splits Discovery Global is also the safe play for shareholders in case regulators block a Paramount-WBD merger, Greenfield said. Since the Paramount deal is for all of WBD, including CNN, Ellison's bid — which includes roughly $24 billion from Middle Eastern sovereign funds — may run into regulatory and political hurdles, Greenfield noted.\"You want the split to happen,\" Greenfield said in an interview. \"If the Paramount deal doesn't get regulatory approval, now you've prevented the split from happening. You're stuck in 2027 with declining cable networks, and you haven't spun them off. Does the U.S. really want a company funded by more Middle Eastern money than money from the Ellisons owning CNN?\" 'Where's Poppa?'WBD's board has argued part its reasoning for rejecting Paramount's $30-per-share bid was its concern with financing, noting more funding comes from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds than the Ellison family, which has committed about $12 billion. Paramount altered the terms of its deal Monday to help address funding concerns. Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the father of David and one of the world's five wealthiest people, agreed to provide \"an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" should the existing financing fall through, Paramount said in a statement. Paramount also said Monday it will publish records confirming the Ellison family trust \"owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that all material liabilities of the Ellison family trust are publicly disclosed.\" Paramount has said the family trust will backstop the financing. WBD's board had previously argued the trust is an \"opaque entity,\" preferring a direct commitment from the Ellisons. Notably, even with the Monday announcement, the Ellisons haven't increased their personal equity investment, which still stands at $12 billion. Internally, some WBD executives have cited the 1970 Carl Reiner movie \"Where's Poppa?\" when speaking about the bid, according to a person familiar with the matter. WBD has pushed for the Ellisons to commit more personal money to the deal. Still, a WBD shareholder may not care where the funding is coming from as long as it's there. The three SWFs involved in the deal are the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Co. and the Qatar Investment Authority. The PIF and QIA, in particular, are known institutions that have contributed billions of dollars to other U.S.-based deals.Correction: This story has been revised to correct that Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash. A previous version misstated this deadline.",

We felt that we could really tap into that and deliver something very unique.\"With Formula 1, Lego isn't just leveraging an existing fandom, it's expanding it, bringing underserved demographics into the world of racing and engaging new customers. \"Lego has a great reputation for picking out the right trends to become a part of, and motorsports in recent years has been on a real upswing,\" said James Zahn, editor in chief of The Toy Book.\"F1, as we've seen, has just become a cultural juggernaut where it is attracting an audience that isn't your typical motorsports fan,\" he said. \"It seems to transcend ages and interests.\"ESPN, which broadcast the 2025 F1 season in the U.S., reported record viewership numbers for the races. The Disney-owned sports network saw an average of 1.3 million viewers across its stations and platforms through the majority of the racing calendar. That was up from a previous record of 1.21 million viewers set in 2022 and up from just 554,000 in 2018, the first year of ESPN's broadcasting deal with F1.Next year, U.S. broadcasting rights move to Apple TV following the success of the Apple-distributed \"F1: The Movie,\" which hit cinemas in June.F1 Academy Lego car model during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Las Vegas on Nov. 19, 2025 in Las Vegas.Hector Vivas | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesIn expanding its catalog of products — introducing meticulously designed F1 car brick sets, complete with team-accurate liveries — Lego has built gateways into the brand for newcomers. \"At the heart of it was understanding our audience's passion points,\" Goldin said. \"When we choose to go into a partnership, could we see ourselves doing something unique that would offer real value ... we felt like we had a real opportunity to deliver experiences that they would really love.\"The F1 portfolio included products for Lego's Duplo line for preschool children, traditional sets for casual builders and Lego Technic sets for more advanced builders.

Building a new future\"Lego is one of our dream partners,\" said Susie Wolff, managing director of F1 Academy, an all-female racing league under the broader F1 umbrella. \"When they joined Formula 1, I immediately reached out to Julia [Goldin], the [chief product and marketing officer], and said, 'Listen, could we explore doing something together with F1 Academy?'\" Wolff told CNBC. \"There's just so many synergies between what they're trying to do and what our main mission is.\"F1 Academy held its inaugural season in 2023. The division was established to address the lack of female drives in the F1 series and aims to develop young female drivers and prepare them for higher levels of competition.\"We're trying to break down the preconceptions of motorsport being a male-dominated environment,\" Wolff said, noting Lego has similarly made strides to promote inclusivity with its brick sets.As part of the ongoing relationship between the two brands, Lego has signed on as a team sponsor for an F1 Academy car starting in 2026.

Zahn of The Toy Book described the collaboration between Lego and Formula 1, particularly the F1 Academy, as a \"perfect partnership.\"\"[The] Female motorsports fan has always been there, but they haven't necessarily been embraced on the consumer product side of things,\" he said.Wolff and Goldin both noted that one of the fastest-growing segments of the Formula 1 fan base is women. \"We are tapping exactly into the the trend of this fandom and we're adding value to the partner, as well,\" Goldin said. \"We see from our data that not only are we engaging more F1 fans with the Lego brand, but vice versa. There are more Lego brand fans that are now becoming fans of Formula 1.\"",

    "body": "Ulta is expanding its wellness shop to have more health-focused brands and more shelf space for those items.Melissa Repko | CNBCSanta may be bringing you some supplements this year.Along with typical holiday wish list items like clothing, perfume and gadgets, the wellness category is poised to gain popularity this shopping season and beyond — particularly as retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target give it more shelf space long before the start of New Year's resolutions.Beauty is always a top-performing holiday category. November and December combined account for about 25% of annual spending on prestige beauty items, which includes brands usually sold by specialty beauty retailers and department stores, according to Circana, a market research group. Holiday shoppers said they plan to spend an average of $247 on beauty while buying gifts this year, the fourth-highest holiday category for spending, according to Circana's annual survey.Yet the beauty category's assortment has become wider ranging with the addition of more health and wellness-focused items, such as products that promise to improve nutrition, hydration and sleep.Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry advisor at Circana, said wellness has gained attention since the Covid pandemic as consumers prioritize self-care and feeling good from the \"inside out.\" She said health-related products typically relegated to drugstore shelves, such as teeth whitening kits, vitamins, full-body deodorants and eye drops, have gotten a glow-up. Some now come in more attractive packaging, have gotten backing from influencers and celebrities or have moved to the beauty section as retailers seize a chance to blend beauty and wellness and become a one-stop shop.Ulta Beauty, in particular, has carved out more space in its stores for wellness. The specialty retailer, which has more than 1,450 stores across the country, has always carried some individual items related to wellness and \"beauty from within,\" said Laura Beres, the retailer's vice president of wellness.Yet as demand grew after the pandemic, Ulta started to open wellness shops inside of its stores in 2021 and devoted about four to eight feet of shelf space to items including probiotic gummies, sleep masks and aromatherapy oils. In August, the company said it would expand the size of those wellness shops to up to 45 feet in about a third of its stores. It's added nearly 30 new wellness brands to its stores, bringing its total to about 100, Beres said.She said customers who shop wellness cut across ages, but Ulta has seen growth especially with millennial shoppers and consumers with household incomes of more than $100,000. She said innovation has sparked more interest, especially as customers seek solutions for key life stages that brands overlooked in the past, such as needs for pre- and post-pregnancy and menopause.This year, she said Ulta is carrying some gift sets of wellness items, including an Advent calendar of Saje Natural Wellness' essential oils and a beauty sleep gift set from Kourtney Kardashian's vitamins brand, Lemme. Yet she said she expects wellness to become a bigger part of the holidays in the future as the category grows.\"It's the perfect combination of being able to give someone else the gift of relaxation during the holiday season in a really elevated way that just frankly, hasn't existed in the market before,\" she said.Neom Wellbeing is one of the brands carried in Ulta Beauty's wellness shops. The United Kingdom-based brand makes home fragrances and body care items with essential oils intended to reduce stress, improve sleep or boost mood or energy levels.Courtesy of Neom WellbeingOne of the brands in Ulta's wellness shop is Neom Wellbeing, a United Kingdom-based company that sells home fragrances and body-care items. Neom sells online through Amazon and its website, with many top-sellers focused on improving sleep.Amanda Kahn, general manager for the U.S. at Neom, said the company's early sellers this holiday season were stocking stuffers that cost less than $20. As shoppers seek value because of inflation, wellness items are attractive because they're also practical, she said.\"It feels very giftable while also delivering a benefit that everyone can use,\" she said.Shoppers at a Bath & Body Works store at an outlet mall on Black Friday in Sunrise, Florida, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works, best known for its fragranced soaps, candles and lotions, has launched more wellness-focused items, too. Early this month, for instance, it began selling a new wellness fragrance collection called \"Water Winter Mint\" with peppermint and alpine waters scents and ingredients including hyaluronic acid and shea butter.Kristie Lewis, senior vice president of merchandising for the company, said more customers have turned to the mall staple for body-care products or gifts that boost mood and solve health-related challenges, such as dry skin or trouble falling asleep.Bath & Body Works plans to keep expanding its aromatherapy line and its ingredient-led products, she said. It has aromatherapy body products with natural essential oils and launched a holiday collection with the scents eucalyptus pine and vanilla nutmeg.\"We're seeing consumers really buy them for themselves, but also for gifts for holiday because who does not want stress relief or sleep, especially around November and December?\" she said. Nutrition and health has been a trending category at Target, too, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a store tour in the Minneapolis area in October. He said wellness has cut across many of the categories Target sells, such as Joylab, a private brand that's offering bright colors and floral prints of workout gear, Khloe Kardashian's Khloud protein popcorn, and beauty kits and skin masks.He said some of those items are giftable, too. Gomez said he bought his nephew protein powder as a gift.Wellness could gain more square footage at Target next year, he added. It's one of the ideas Target is considering as its deal with Ulta Beauty ends in August and the branded beauty shops inside of hundreds of its stores close, Gomez said. While supplements tend to be more popular around New Year's resolution season, Gruns is hoping its sales get a holiday bump. It's selling some packs of gummies with a holiday flair, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor.Courtesy of GrunsGrüns is one of the wellness items on Target's shelves. The superfood greens gummies are a healthier spin on a fruit snack for adults, but with a nutritional punch similar to a greens powder, said founder and CEO Chad Janis. Its name is inspired by \"grün,\" the word for green in German.Retailers including Walmart, Sprouts Farmers Market and Sam's Club sell the gummies, which have expanded to other lines for kids and for immune support since the company was founded in 2023.While vitamin and supplement sales tend to spike around the new year, Janis said the company hopes its gummies will be a gift or a stocking stuffer. It's selling some holiday-inspired items, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor and a Target pack that's holiday themed.Walmart is carrying some wellness items for the holidays, too, as it sees millennial and Gen Z shoppers seek out self-care and wellness items year-round, such as gift sets of body washes from vitamin maker Olly and vitamin patches from Barrière that look like stickers or temporary tattoos. Even outside of the beauty aisles, retailers have leaned into wellness as a gift-giving category, such as Best Buy, which sells Oura rings and has demos for the health-tracking wearables, and Kohl's, which carries items including massage guns and portable ice baths.During this holiday season, wellness may also get more attention from shoppers who buy items for themselves while shopping for gifts for friends and family, Circana's Jensen said.\"Here's a little ornament with a lip gloss for you and teeth whitening products for me,\" she said. Yet, in the coming years, Jensen said she expects wellness to gain prominence on holiday wish lists because of their high price tags and their wider acceptance. She compared it to anti-aging skin-care products and gift sets. She said they once seemed taboo and now, they're an item that people request.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

    "body": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations create closeness and intimacy.To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own.In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us.1. 'They are who they are.'Your partner's mistakes aren't yours to carry, and their successes aren't yours to claim. They are their own person living alongside you, not an extension of you.Similar phrases:\"She's always been like that.\"\"I know that's one of his favorite things to do.\"2. 'I'm not surprised at all!'When you really understand your partner, you're not likely to be taken aback by what they say or do. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. Similar phrases: \"Oh yeah, that's my mate alright!\"\"That's totally her style.\"3. 'They're quirky like that.'Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. But if you really know your partner, you notice those details and often find affection in them.Similar phrases:\"They sneeze like a train!\"\"His hiccups are kind of adorable.\"4. 'I trust them to be themselves.'Deep knowledge builds trust. When you know your partner, you trust them to act authentically and responsibly, whether you're together or apart.Similar phrases:\"She can be a little intense, but I trust her to make good choices.\"\"I know they'll be respectful.\" 5. 'That is a core value.'Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Even when you disagree, you can acknowledge what truly matters to them without dismissing or demeaning it.Similar phrases:\"I know this is really important to them.\"\"He's very passionate about politics.\"6. 'They struggle with that.'Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness.Similar phrases:\"I know this is painful for them.\"\"I see her struggle and want to support her through it.\"7. 'I can't change them.'Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it.Similar phrases:\"They'll change only if they want to.\"\"I accept that we see this differently, even if I don't like it.\" 8. 'I didn't know that about them!'Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.Similar phrases:\"I never realized they felt that way.\"\"Even though we've been married for years, I'm still learning new things about him.\"Want to get to know your partner better? Here are a few ways to start:Ask open-ended questions with genuine curiosity.Practice seeing situations from their perspective.Speak with respect during difficult conversations.Use physical touch, like hugging or holding hands, to bond.Show presence by putting down your phone, making eye contact and prioritizing time together.The answer to real intimacy is simple: You have to understand and choose each other, every day.Dr. Cortney S.

    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

    "body": "About a decade ago, Andy Hill was looking for a change.  Hill, now 44, was feeling burnt out at his job in corporate events marketing. While the frequent travel and weekend events were fun while Hill was in his 20s, the gig had begun to lose its luster after he got married and started a family.In 2016, Hill started a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, where he and his guests discussed their journeys and stories around family finances. It was around this time that he became interested in FIRE, which is short for \"financial independence, retire early.\"The strategy generally involves saving a high percentage of your income in service of aggressively investing. Save enough, and you can either buy income-producing investments, such as real estate, or begin withdrawing from your stock portfolio to replace income from a 9-to-5 job. Hill was all in. \"I was very interested in FIRE, like traditional FIRE, hard-charging, get me out of here,\" Hill tells CNBC Make It, referring to an early model of FIRE that prioritized slashing expenses to maximize savings and retire quickly. \"I want to save as much as possible, and I don't care what happens now. That did not work well for my life.\"Hill and his wife were saving upwards of 50% of their dual income, often cutting out many of life's niceties to do it. They shopped at lower-cost grocery stores and sold anything around the house they determined they didn't need. If family, friends or colleagues invited them to events that didn't align with a strict budget, they said, \"no thanks.\"In many ways, it worked — the couple wiped out $50,000 in debt and built a portfolio worth $500,000. But when Hill suggested saving even more in order to retire as quickly as he could, money discussions started turning into money fights, he says. \"We did the 'super saver' thing for a while, and that led us into marriage counseling,\" Hill says.Talking in counseling gave Hill and his wife a new approach to managing their marriage — one built on compromise, communication and empathizing with each other's feelings. They also took on a new approach to money, what he and some other financial pros call \"Coast FIRE\": Once you save enough such that your portfolio can grow to where you want it in retirement, you take your foot off the gas, savings-wise, and \"coast.\" It's a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" For couples in particular, he says, taking this approach allows you spend more money — or time — pursuing the things you value in life together. \"[It's about] starting from that position of dreaming personally and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says. Finding middle groundHill discovered that his aggressive FIRE strategy meant sacrificing on both ends. Not only was the pressure to cut back on spending limiting what the family could do, but his hope to bank as much money as possible meant that work was taking him away from the people he loved.\"I was traveling during my children's birthdays, working with supervisors that graded my performance on how late I could stay at the office and overall, I was giving a lot more time to work than to my health or my family,\" he says.Still, abandoning the strategy seemingly threw a wrench into Hill's hopes of leaving his job for good — his plan was to save enough to invest in rental properties for passive income, he says. Hill's wife suggested that he take the money he'd been saving for rental property and use it to turn his side hustle — something he enjoyed much more than his day job — into a full-fledged business. \"It was this epiphany moment,\" he says. Rather than waiting for the early retirement finish line, he could use some of his savings to buy time and space to pursue his passion. Hill kept his podcast and added financial coaching and speaking engagements, going into business for himself full time in 2020. When he left his job, he was making about $180,000 a year working 40 to 50 hours a week. These days, he pays himself about $100,000, but works about 20 to 25 hours a week. As for his savings rate, \"We found a middle ground,\" Hill says. \"We said, 'Well, we can continue to save and invest, but maybe let's dial it back by like a cool 20, 25% and then dial some of that back into our lifestyle.'\"Unlocking time freedomHill says his shift to a Coast FIRE lifestyle allowed him and his wife to focus on time freedom. If you can build enough of a retirement nest egg, the thinking goes, you can let it grow on the back burner and use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either in the form of spending more or finding a different approach to work. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says. \"Wouldn't it be cool to work 20 to 25 hours a week until we're in our 60s and then just enjoy more time now?\"Hill and his wife have both taken the latter approach. The couple had about $500,000 saved by age 40, and have since pumped their net worth up to over $1 million. They've used their financial flexibility to scale back at work. While Hill built his business, his wife realized that she was tired of working for clients at all hours at her marketing agency. \"She said, 'I've always wanted to work with my hands. I've always wanted to do something where when the work day was done, I was done,'\" Hill says. So she went back to school to become an esthetician. Now she works part-time at a dermatologist's office and goes back to her own life when the office closes. The goal, Hill says, is to find the balance between saving for the future and living a fulfilling life now. The two spend Mondays sipping coffee after sending the kids to school and exercising together. Hill cooks family dinner twice a week. They've taken dance classes together and are learning pickleball. \"With that extra 20 to 25 hours that we're not working, we can take care of our health,\" Hill says. \"We can invest time in our marriage so that we're actually having conversations with each other and not being surprised by arguments. We can be more present parents and be there for the important moments for our kids.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "For many Americans, $1 million is seen as a savings benchmark for retirement. But in 32 U.S. states, the estimated minimum needed to retire at 65 is less than that.That's according to a state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates, which estimates the minimum household savings needed to retire at 65 and cover essential living expenses over 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health care. To determine savings minimums in each state, GOBankingRates looked at cost of living data for retirees 65 and older from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, minus average Social Security income. It then used a 4% annual withdrawal rate to estimate the total amount of savings needed to cover remaining expenses.These estimates focus on the minimum needed to cover day-to-day living costs, not a comfortable retirement. They exclude discretionary spending and don't account for factors like inheritances or paid-off mortgages.The analysis is also based on household expenses, meaning that retirement costs could be supported by more than one person's savings or income for a given home.Even so, basic living costs in retirement can exceed what many people expect. About half of U.S. workers say they'll need at least $500,000 to retire comfortably — not just cover essentials — according to a 2025 Bankrate survey.Here's a look at the U.S. states where the estimated minimum savings needed to retire at 65 comes in below $1 million.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Five years before Abi Caswell opened her own bakery, she had never made a single cookie. Today, she owns and manages two bake shops that bring in seven figures in sales, she says.Caswell, 30, is the founder of Batter, a bakery with two storefronts in Hammond, Louisiana and in New Orleans.Her ultimate goal has always been to own her own business, she tells CNBC Make It. \"Since I was a kid, I always knew I wanted to work for myself,\" she says. \"I wanted to be able to control my schedule, and I wanted to make my own money.\"Her interest in sweet treats began as a teenager: Caswell worked at a local cupcake shop from ages 16 to 20 and \"loved everything about it,\" though she wasn't involved in the baking process.After graduating from Louisiana State University of Alexandria in 2018 with a major in business administration and a minor in marketing, Caswell moved to Hammond with her husband Trey.While working full-time as an executive assistant, Caswell started experimenting with baking her own cakes as a hobby.After she made a cake for a friend's husband, \"one of our mutual friends was like, 'This is so good. You've got to sell these. We have nothing like this here,'\" Caswell recalls. Caswell initially planned to stick to cakes and cupcakes, she says, but with the rise of popular cookie chains like Crumbl and Insomnia Cookies — neither of which had storefronts in Hammond at the time, Caswell notes — she decided to capitalize on the craze and make cookies the focus of her baking side hustle.Courtesy of Abi CaswellFrom home baker to business owner In fall 2021, Caswell started experimenting with cookie recipes with the help of her husband Trey, who works as a high school basketball coach. It took Caswell six months to develop her now-signature chocolate chip cookie recipe.\"We made so many batches of cookies that were terrible,\" she says. \"They would just never be quite right because I had no clue what I was doing. So every time I made one, I just learned something new about it.\"She began posting her bakes online and on social media, and says she quickly attracted a strong local customer base.In spring 2022, Caswell left her full-time executive assistant job to focus on baking.\"I was going to work from 8 to 5:30 [p.m.], and then I was coming home and baking till like 1 a.m.,\" she recalls. \"It was just too much.\"Around the time Caswell left her job, she landed a spot at the farmer's market in Hammond. Every Friday, she baked 500 cookies with her husband's help to sell at the market on Saturday, and they regularly sold out within 30 minutes, she says.\"That was when I realized, we've got to get in a store. Like, this is not sustainable. We have to find another way to sell,\" Caswell says.The Batter storefront in Hammond, LA.Courtesy of Abi Caswell.It wasn't easy for Caswell to secure a storefront in Hammond. Caswell developed a business plan to open a bakery with the help of her local small business development center, but she had no money saved at the time and several banks rejected her request for a loan.Finally, a bank representative helped her secure a $40,000 loan, for which Caswell says she had to put up her house as collateral, to rent a storefront and install baking appliances. In November 2022, Caswell officially opened her first Batter shop in downtown Hammond with a team of eight employees — a head baker and seven part-time bakery clerks. She had just turned 27 years old.Scaling the businessCaswell was \"running off adrenaline\" for the first few months, she says. She spent up to 18 hours a day working at the bakery to keep up with demand.\"We couldn't keep anything in stock,\" she says. \"We had an amazing time, but it was very, very stressful.\" Batter brought in mid-six figures in its first year of operation, according to Caswell, and she was able to pay off her bank loan entirely by May 2023.After the success of the Hammond location, Caswell opened another Batter location in New Orleans in December 2024 with the goal of reaching a larger customer base.Last year, the two locations collectively brought in seven figures in yearly sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Some of Caswell's cookie creationsCourtesy of Abi CaswellCaswell estimates that she sells over a thousand baked goods each day. Cookies, cupcakes, cakes, petit fours and pull-apart loaves are staples on Batter's menu year-round, she says, but they also offer seasonal treats like a king cake-inspired cookie for Mardi Gras. The bakery's signature chocolate chip cookies cost $3.75 each.Batter also sells cake balls, croissants and homemade pop tarts that Caswell sources from other local women-owned bakeries, and both locations serve coffee.Right now, Caswell is close to achieving a longtime dream: developing her signature chocolate chip cookie recipe into a wholesale mix.She says her first drop of 150 bags of cookie mix, which she sells for $14.99 each, quickly sold out online, and her goal is to get the product into grocery stores this year.\"Before I ever opened Batter, I always said to my husband, 'We're going to be on these shelves one day,'\" she says.Developing a mix will make her cookies \"more accessible,\" rather than being tied to a storefront, Caswell says.'Never truly off the clock'One trait that Caswell believes is crucial to her success is adaptability.\"A lot of being a business owner is what your tolerance level is for your plans to change, for things to pop up and things to go wrong,\" she says.Running both bakeries hasn't been easy – \"every day there's something new going on,\" Caswell says.Caswell currently doesn't have a cake decorator for the New Orleans store, so she's filling the position herself until she can hire a new decorator.Caswell typically splits her time between both stores, which are an hour's drive apart, but since her New Orleans store is understaffed, Caswell has been working at that location \"pretty much full-time\" every day of the week, she says. That's the \"joy of being a small business owner,\" she jokes: you're \"never truly off the clock.\"Caswell holds a bag of her signature chocolate chip cookie mix.Courtesy of Abi CaswellOnline marketing has always been a key element of her business, Caswell says: it's how she reached many of her early customers, and she credits her social media reach for boosting her business to this day.Caswell currently has almost 300,000 followers on her TikTok account, where she posts about her daily routine, shares behind-the-scenes baking videos and opens up about the challenges of running her bakeries.Beyond promoting her bakes, Caswell's goal is to show her audience what it really takes to run a small business.\"I try to be as honest as I can be on social media,\" she says. \"I really think that people don't understand the mental undertaking, but also the time commitment.\" When you own a business, \"there is no real downtime,\" Caswell says. \"Even when I'm on vacation, if the stores are open, I'm on the clock.\"Most of the time, \"the losses hurt more than the wins feel good,\" she continues, but Caswell's goal for this year is to give herself a chance \"to relish what we've done.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "One kilogram gold bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery, operated by Gold Corp.Matt Jelonek | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold climbed to a fresh all-time high, crossing $5,000 an ounce on Monday and extending its record-breaking run as investors seek the safety of the yellow metal amid rising geopolitical tensions and global fiscal risks.Spot gold prices and U.S. gold futures for February gained 1.2%, trading at $5,042 and $5,036 an ounce, respectively. The precious metal's surge comes as recent flashpoints from Greenland and Venezuela to the Middle East underscore higher geopolitical risk, reinforcing gold's appeal as a hedge against uncertainty.\"The recent further leg up in gold and silver prices has arrived on the back of geoeconomics issues related to Greenland,\" HSBC wrote in a note last week.Silver also rallied Monday, with spot prices jumping 3% to $106.1 per ounce, also benefiting from industrial demand.Analysts at Union Bancaire Privée said Friday that prices have rallied on the back of sustained demand from both institutional and retail buyers.\"We anticipate that gold should enjoy another strong year, reflecting ongoing central bank and retail investment demand, with a year-end target price of USD 5,200 per ounce,\" UBP said.Goldman Sachs sees the demand base for gold to have broadened beyond traditional channels. Western ETF holdings have climbed by about 500 tonnes since the start of 2025, while newer instruments used to hedge macro-policy risks, including physical purchases by high-net-worth families, have become an increasingly important source of demand.The investment bank recently lifted its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 an ounce, up from $4,900 previously, arguing that hedges against global macro and policy risks have become \"sticky,\" effectively lifting the starting point for gold prices this year.Central bank purchases also remain robust. Goldman estimates central-bank purchases are now averaging around 60 tonnes a month, far above the pre-2022 average of 17 tonnes, with emerging-market central banks continuing to shift reserves into gold.Crucially, the bank assumes that hedges against global macro-policy risks, including concerns around fiscal sustainability, will remain in place through 2026, unlike election-related hedges that unwound quickly after the U.S. vote in late 2024.\"We assume that hedges of global macro policy risks remain stable as these perceived risks (e.g. fiscal sustainability) may not fully resolve in 2026,\" Goldman said last week.",

    "body": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks during the Senate Democrats' news conference in the U.S. Capitol on the deadline for the release of the Epstein files on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesChances for a partial shutdown of the U.S. government by the end of this week grew on Sunday due to outrage over federal immigration agents fatally shooting Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the second such incident this month.A growing chorus of Democratic senators warned that they will not vote for a massive $1.2 trillion package to fund federal government operations if it includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement efforts.On Sunday, a person familiar with the thinking of the Senate's Republican leadership told CNBC that they will not remove the DHS funding portion, despite that warning.\"Government funding expires at the end of the week, and Republicans are determined to not have another government shutdown,\" that person said.\"We will move forward as planned and hope Democrats can find a path forward to join us,\" they said.The House of Representatives on Thursday approved the funding package.Without Senate approval of the deal by Friday, the federal government will begin a partial shutdown.The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure.The deadly shooting of Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was a U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday morning ignited already simmering concern among members of the Democratic caucuses in Congress about funding DHS. Democrats already were angry about the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman, by an ICE officer in that city on Jan. 7.\"Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement on Sunday.\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,\" he said. \"People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"Sen. Angus King of Maine told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, \"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] funding under these circumstances.\"\"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem,\" said King, one of two independents who caucuses with Democrats. \"We don't have to have a shutdown,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosKing played a key role in ending last year's 43-day shutdown.  He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.Members of the House, which went into a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would have to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It is unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or would do so. Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes appropriations for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury. \"No, I am not voting for this funding,\" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.\"The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier last week that the \"suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.\"\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said on X Saturday.\"I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate — Republicans must work with us to do that,\" she said.It was unclear if the Senate could split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up. It remains possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats. DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law passed last summer. But that is far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end the record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.\"I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,\" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown.\"Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.\"  Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this article.",

Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAir travel disruptions will linger into Monday even after a winter storm that forced airlines to cancel more than 14,000 U.S. flights over the weekend clears out.The winter storm is bringing heavy snow, ice, and sleet, followed by bitter cold across much of the country.More than 1,870 flights were canceled for Monday, far fewer than over the weekend but a sign that airlines will need a day to recalibrate after the storm. A third of Monday's departures from New York's LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy Airport, and a quarter of Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, were canceled, as were more than half of those out of Boston. Only 21 Tuesday flights were canceled thus far, however.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of a major storm to prevent planes, passengers and crew from getting stranded, which can worsen disruptions after severe weather clears. January is a low season for travel but the vast storm was snarling travel across the country for hundreds of thousands of people.American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and other U.S. carriers said they are waiving change and cancellation fees as well as fare differences to rebook for customers with tickets to and from more than 40 airports around the country. The waivers include restrictive basic economy tickets. American, JetBlue and Southwest are scheduled to report results this week, and their executives are likely to receive questions from analysts about the impact of the storm on their financial results. The winter storm comes less than a month after airspace was closed over parts of the Caribbean following the U.S. attacks in Venezuela, prompting mass flight cancellations at the end of the holiday season.On Sunday, airlines canceled 10,251 U.S. flights, according to FlightAware, with affected airports stretching from Texas to Maine.

Kennedy International Airport, which have more international flights, were also canceled for Sunday.Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines cancelled 1,471 mainline flights on Sunday, close to half of its schedule, while Atlanta-based Delta scrubbed 1,307, or 40%, according to FlightAware. Close to half the flights at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world's busiest, were canceled.Even airports out of the storm's path were affected as airlines grounded planes.American said last week that it was repositioning its airplanes and increasing staffing at major airports to help soften the impact of the storm and to \"set the stage for a fast, safe recovery once conditions improve.\"States of emergencyMore than 20 U.S. states were under emergency declarations this weekend due to the massive winter storm.As of 10:05 a.m. ET Sunday, more than 797,000 U.S. customers were without power, with the worst hit areas being Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, according to PowerOutage.com.The Department of Energy issued an emergency order temporarily authorizing grid operator PJM Interconnection to run power generation facilities to help ensure electricity amid extreme temperatures and storm impact across the mid-Atlantic region, though it may exceed environmental permit restrictions.\"As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions to the Mid-Atlantic, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the PJM region is non-negotiable,\" U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.The Department of Energy also authorized the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, to run backup generators for the state.The National Weather Service warned last week that the winter storm could affect hundreds of millions of people and is expected to \"bring widespread heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain from the Southern Rockies to New England through Monday.\"— CNBC's April Roach contributed to this report.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to the press upon returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on January 13, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.\"Canada's government has transparently outlined that the agreement with China is fundamentally about domestic consumers and businesses in Canada and China, not schemes aimed at other markets,\" Matthew Holmes, executive vice president and chief of public policy of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.\"A structured and stable relationship with China or any other country ... are not to replace our deeply rooted relationship with the United States that continues to be overwhelmingly good for workers, consumers and North American competitiveness,\" he added.   The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosIn August 2025, Trump raised the tariff on Canadian goods to 35%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out.

Executives across the country have been largely reluctant to comment publicly on political issues throughout Trump's second term.It does, however, say that \"representatives of Minnesota's business community have been working every day behind the scenes with federal, state and local officials to advance real solutions.\"\"These efforts have included close communication with the Governor, the White House, the Vice President and local mayors. There are ways for us to come together to foster progress,\" the letter reads. Minnesota is home to 17 Fortune 500 companies, according to the state's government. The state ranks fifth in Fortune 500 concentration per capita. The letter comes one day after federal officers shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis.The Trump administration has surged federal law enforcement to the city to enforce its immigration crackdown and pursue allegations of widespread welfare fraud in the state. Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosPretti's killing is the latest incident in a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration officials that has prompted unrest in the region. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, earlier this month. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to withdraw federal law enforcement from the state. The administration has resisted those calls and blamed the state's Democratic leadership for not assisting its efforts. \"President Trump, you can end this today,\" Walz said at a Sunday news conference. \"Pull these folks back, do humane, focused, effective immigration control, you've got the support of all of us to do that.\"Meanwhile, Gregory Bovino, the commander of the Border Patrol operation in Minnesota, doubled down on the federal government's actions. \"Our title eight immigration mission continues unabated here in Minneapolis despite yesterday's tragedy that was preventable by folks making better choices, politicians, journalists and would-be anarchists and rioters,\" Bovino said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and CEO of Ford Jim Farley clap, as President Trump visits a Ford production center, in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersDETROIT — The only consistency has been inconsistency for the U.S. automotive industry during the first half of this decade — a trend that's expected to continue amid challenging market conditions in 2026.The U.S. auto sector — a crucial driver of the economy estimated around 4.8% of America's gross domestic product — has endured rolling crises since the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered U.S. assembly plants in early 2020. The global health crisis was followed by yearslong supply chain issues, semiconductor chip shortages, political whipsawing, tariffs and other challenges for all-electric and autonomous vehicles.Automakers have been surprisingly resilient during the challenges, but those issues are now combining with more traditional industry problems of affordability and slowing consumer demand. That's all creating a more challenging environment for automakers in 2026.\"We've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\" Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during an interview. \"That's the situation that we're in right now.\"Other executives have expressed similar sentiments as they prepare for a \"new\" U.S. automotive industry: one that's more expensive, smaller and, by many means, less predictable.Automotive forecasters are calling for steady to lower sales this year, despite industry sales only hitting 16.3 million units last year. That was the highest level since the pandemic in 2020, but down from more than 17 million for five consecutive years before the global health crisis, according to industry data.\"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"'Affordability crisis'One of the largest industry issues — and one that's a culmination of many factors — is the affordability of new vehicles. New vehicles prices have climbed; the average transaction price was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.Average transaction prices historically increased on average 3.2% year-over-year, but from 2020-2022 that average nearly tripled to 9%.\"Pandemic-induced production constraints and supply chain chaos didn't just disrupt the market temporarily. They fundamentally restructured pricing dynamics. This elevated plateau is now the new baseline, which has the market anchored at these higher price points,\" said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights.It's not just vehicle prices hitting consumers' wallets either. They're also dealing with inflation, increases in maintenance and repairs, and 13% annual average increases for insurance over the past five years, according to Cox Automotive.\"The cumulative weight of all these increases has pushed total vehicle ownership costs beyond reach for many middle- and lower-income households, constraining market access and accelerating the affordability crisis,\" said Cox Automotive interim chief economist Jeremy Robb. Cox Automotive reports it took 33.7 weeks of median household income to buy the average new vehicle in November 2019. Now it's 36.3 weeks. That's down from a record high of 42.2 weeks during the pandemic, but still means vehicles cost thousands of dollars more than historic levels.David Christ, Toyota Motor's U.S. sales chief, warned that the current tariff and trade environment will cause prices to continue to increase this year, despite the concerns.\"On our end, we're just taking it month-to-month, and we're watching the competitors closely,\" Christ said on a call with reporters earlier this month. \"But we feel prices are going to go up for us and for our competitors.\" To combat the slower sales and affordability challenges, Toyota and other automakers have said they will refocus on lower-priced vehicle models — a change from recent years when automakers prioritized their most expensive, highly profitable vehicles during supply chain shortages.\"Every automaker must face the reality that the American market has changed for the foreseeable future,\" said Lance Woelfer, head of American Honda Motor's U.S. sales.For Honda, Woelfer said that means increasing production on less expensive trims as well as focusing on certified pre-owned vehicles, which are used but backed by company warranties. For others, such as Ford, that could include reentering abandoned segments such as sedans, according to its CEO.\"Never say never,\" Farley told reporters during the event in Detroit. \"The sedan market is very vibrant. It's not that there isn't a market there. It's just we couldn't find a way to compete and be profitable. Well, we may find a way to do that.\"Ford sells sedans outside of the U.S. but exited the domestic market with the cancellation of the Michigan-made Fusion in 2020. It also eliminated the larger Taurus sedan and smaller Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus before that.Ford's crosstown rivals General Motors and Stellantis have largely exited the traditional U.S. sedan market as well.Affordability concerns are generating attention from outside the automotive industry as well. A Senate committee led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, requested a hearing with CEOs from Ford, GM and Stellantis about affordability and other issues in the automotive industry. The hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14 but was postponed amid scheduling conflicts and general pushback from Ford about Tesla CEO Elon Musk not attending the meeting, according to a letter from the company to the subcommittee that was obtained by Politico.2025 Jeep Grand Cherokees are displayed for sale at Larry H. Miller Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram dealership in Thornton, Colorado on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Hyoung Chang | The Denver Post | Getty Images'Prepared for surprises'Automakers are also bracing this year for potentially volatile U.S. regulations and trade negotiations, such as the upcoming renegotiating of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that's scheduled for later this year.Currently, automakers can import new vehicles from South Korea or Japan with lower tariffs than from Canada or Mexico, depending on their U.S. content. The Trump administration has reached trade deals on vehicles with those Asian countries but not its neighbors to the north and south. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, USMCA could be a tailwind for automakers that have a lot of production in the U.S.\"Looking to 2026, our cycle work would suggest that autos would have a difficult time outperforming given a relatively flat y/y volume outlook. However, we see reasons for optimism for US [automakers],\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote last month in an investor note. Wall Street will begin getting its first outlooks from automakers this week beginning with GM announcing its fourth quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this month reconfirmed that the automaker expects 2026 will be better than 2025.  GM's 2025 guidance included adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.But depending on the automaker, Wall Street analysts expect mixed results for the U.S. industry as it continues to deal with uncertain times.\"It is hard to imagine how 2026 could bring more external shocks and share price divergence than 2025 but, with no visible end to industry disruption, we are also prepared for surprises, impairments and strategic shifts,\" Jefferies analyst Owen Paterson said in an investor note this month.",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

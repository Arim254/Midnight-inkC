    "body": "Move over, coastal hubs: many of the best cities for Gen Z workers are located in the Midwest, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company.Using data from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Checkr ranked the top cities for Gen Z workers based on their scores in three key areas: employment, affordability and social life.Checkr calculated the employment score for each city based on its unemployment rate and labor force participation. To determine the affordability score, Checkr analyzed income to rent ratio, real personal income and the percentage of renters paying over 30% of their income.Each city's social life score is based on the Gen Z portion of the population in each city and the number of Gen Z members per entertainment establishment. Employment and affordability were weighted 40% each, while social life was weighted 20%.For Gen Z workers making entry-level salaries, \"it's going to be really difficult to survive and save money\" in major cities like Los Angeles and New York, according to Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr.Cities like Des Moines and Milwaukee may not have the same hustle and bustle, but they can offer lower costs of living and slower-paced lifestyles, Radbil says.The cities on this list provide both \"career momentum and lifestyle alignment in a single package,\" he says.Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for Gen Z workers.1. Madison, WisconsinMadison secured the top spot because of its proximity to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Radbil says.Students from all over the country are drawn to the school due to its academics, sports and social scene, Radbil says, and the city is a \"great starting point\" for grads to begin their careers.Beyond the university, Madison's proximity to Chicago and Milwaukee means that young people have access to \"very strong job opportunities\" in the area, according to Radbil.2. Minneapolis, MinnesotaOne of the larger cities in the Midwest, Minneapolis offers city comforts paired with a low cost of living.Minneapolis is also attractive to Gen Z workers because of its progressive values and welcoming social scene, Radbil says.3. Des Moines, IowaDes Moines has a thriving insurance industry, which provides ample job opportunities for Gen Z workers interested in that sector, Radbil says.Beyond that, the city offers affordability and a low cost of living, which provide \"a growing appeal to younger workers who want a meaningful start without that big city burnout.\"4. Omaha, NebraskaOmaha \"blends that Midwestern charm with pretty real economic momentum,\" according to Radbil.Gen Z workers can find ample jobs in the insurance, finance and education sectors, and a \"small startup ecosystem\" is also developing, Radbil says.Notably, legendary investor Warren Buffett calls Omaha home, he says.5. Nashville, TennesseeNashville is best known for its music roots, but the city also boasts a growing tech presence and a \"very cool entrepreneurial scene,\" Radbil says.Radbil compares Nashville to Austin \"without the insane rent prices yet,\" although the city's popularity is likely to drive up the cost of living, he says.Still, Gen Z workers are attracted to Nashville because \"the lifestyle there is so appealing,\" he says.6. St. Louis, MissouriAffordability is the main draw for St. Louis, Radbil says.Its low cost of living is attractive to young workers looking to settle down and purchase a home, according to Radbil.\"St. Louis gives you that opportunity to maybe get a start for a lower price, and really feel like you have some roots and you own something, which is important to people,\" he says.7. Austin, TexasAustin is a \"Gen Z magnet,\" according to Radbil.The city's atmosphere is \"very young and culturally rich, and there's so much to do outside,\" he says.Economically, Austin is also flourishing: its business-friendly environment has attracted large companies like Tesla and Apple, and the startup scene is booming, according to Radbil.As a result, \"the job market is incredible,\" Radbil says.8. Milwaukee, WisconsinMilwaukee is an attractive option for Gen Z workers due to its strong job market and reasonable cost of living, according to Radbil.While young professionals may only be able to afford tiny studios in major cities, in Milwaukee, \"you could get an apartment overlooking Lake Michigan,\" Radbil says.The city also offers a robust social scene and \"amazing\" summer weather, he says.9. Salt Lake City, UtahSalt Lake City is \"one of the most balanced cities for Gen Z workers\" due to its growing economy, access to nature and relative affordability, Radbil says.It's also an \"awesome location\" for young professionals who work remotely, he says: \"All those mountain towns and cities out west have really grown in popularity.\"10. Boston, MassachusettsBoston is home to \"world-class\" universities like Harvard University and MIT, which attract thousands of young professionals across industries.\"The universities are so important to creating jobs for people,\" he says. \"Whether it's science or biotech or just working at the university, I think that the job opportunities there are awesome.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

He recalled selling a third of Baron Funds' Tesla holding a few years ago due to criticism from his clients and the media about the significant concentration in a single stock. Baron emphasized that his personal position remains entirely intact.\"We sold 30% for clients.

I will be the last person out of the stock,'\" he said. \"I will not sell a single share of my shares until my clients sold 100% of their shares. ...

    "body": "Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhen incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when was Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger and Albertsons.McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon.Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.How Walmart's stock compares to its rivalsStock gains by Amazon have outpaced Walmart's during the years of McMillon's tenure, with 1,225% share gains by the tech giant compared to a 312% increase by Walmart.However, Walmart's performance on Wall Street has far surpassed big-box retail competitor Target's across McMillon's time as CEO. Shares of Target are up about 60% since February 2014, compared to Walmart's 312% gains.During the years of the Covid pandemic, Target's steep share gains surpassed those of Walmart. Yet the Minneapolis-based cheap chic retailer's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for about four years and dragged down its stock performance.Like Walmart, Target is preparing for a leadership change in February. Last month, Target said Michael Fiddelke, its chief operating officer and former CFO, would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Costco also stands out as a competitor that has posted steeper share gains than Walmart. Shares of the warehouse club retailer, which competes with both Walmart stores and those of its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, have shot up by more than 700% during the years of McMillon's tenure.Walmart's supermarket competitors — Kroger and Albertsons, in particular — have lagged behind that. Shares of Kroger, which includes about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer and Ralphs, climbed 265% during McMillon's tenure. Shares of Albertsons, which includes Safeway, Tom Thumb and other grocery chains, rose by only 16%.Albertsons went public in 2020, which gave it less time for stock gains. For about two of those years, from roughly 2022 to 2024, Kroger and Albertsons also sought to merge their two companies into a larger grocer that could better compete with Walmart, Costco, Amazon and others. The deal was ultimately blocked by a U.S. judge, after the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the merger.Dollar stores also fell short of Walmart's stock performance while McMillon was CEO. Dollar Tree and Dollar General, who compete with Walmart in offering groceries and other items at low prices, posted 104% and 85% share gains, respectively, compared to Walmart's 312% increase.Notably, both dollar store banners' stocks outperformed Walmart's during some of those years, yet have been struggling more recently.Walmart's stock was about flat Friday following the retirement announcement, and shares have climbed about 13% this year.— CNBC's Tom Rotunno contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new position in Alphabet, making the Google parent the conglomerate's 10th largest equity holding at the end of September, according to a regulatory filing.Berkshire disclosed a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet at the end of the third quarter, a surprising move given Buffett's traditional value investing philosophy and reluctance toward high-growth, tech names. While Berkshire has owned Apple for years, Buffett has called it more of a consumer products company than a pure tech play.The purchase was also likely made by Berkshire investment managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have been more active in technology names. One of them initiated an investment in Amazon back in 2019, and Berkshire still owns $2.2 billion worth of the e-commerce shares.Alphabet has been the market's standout winner this year with shares rallying 46%. Strong demand for artificial intelligence has driven solid momentum in Alphabet's cloud business.Buffett previously admitted that he \"blew it\" by failing to invest early in Google even though he had insight into its advertising potential. Berkshire's auto insurance unit Geico was an early customer of Google, paying the search engine 10 bucks every time someone clicked on the ad at the time.\"I had seen the product work, and I knew the kind of margins [they had],\" Buffett said in 2018. \"I didn't know enough about technology to know whether this really was the one that would stop the competitive race.\"Trimming AppleBerkshire continued paring back its massive Apple stake, trimming the position by another 15% in the quarter to $60.7 billion.Buffett went on a head-turning selling spree in Apple in 2024, slashing two-thirds of the shares Berkshire held in a surprising move for the famously long-term-focused investor. Berkshire also cut the holding in the second quarter of this year.Even with the continuous sales, the iPhone maker remains Berkshire's biggest equity holding.The conglomerate also dialed back its Bank of America stake by 6% to a bet worth just under $30 billion. Berkshire reduced holdings in Verisign and DaVita as well in the third quarter.Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters as valuations continued to climb in the tech-driven bull market.The 95-year-old Buffett is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, with longtime lieutenant Greg Abel set to take the reins. Investors have been watching Berkshire's positioning closely for clues about the next era of leadership and how its investment approach may evolve.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "An exterior view of the new JPMorgan Chase global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue on Nov. 13, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.\"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,\" Pusateri said in a statement. \"The free market worked.\"The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the \"open-banking rule\" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in \"anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior\" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.Wider impactThe deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  \"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.Source: RobinhoodProponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.\"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,\" Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.\"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,\" Lee said. \"We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.\"",

Nasa | Getty ImagesA former Air Force intelligence officer has pleaded guilty to lying to a federal agent by falsely claiming that her estranged astronaut wife illegally accessed her bank account while aboard the International Space Station for six months, prosecutors in Houston, Texas, said Friday.The guilty plea by Summer Worden, 50, on Thursday comes more than five years after she was indicted in the space case for lying about actions by her wife, Anne McClain, a U.S. Army colonel, West Point graduate and Iraq war combat veteran, while they were in the midst of a divorce.The claim came at a time when Worden said that the couple was engaged in a custody battle over what Worden's then-6-year-old son, who had been conceived through in vitro fertilization and carried by a surrogate.Worden's trial in the case was scheduled to begin next Monday in Houston federal court.The Kansas resident was accused of making false statements about McClain to NASA's Office of Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission, where she alleged that McCain had committed identity theft.Worden in July \"alleged her estranged spouse had guessed the password and illegally accessed her bank account while the spouse was deployed to the International Space Station,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement headlined \"Far Out\" on Friday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov.

    "body": "Job seekers wait to enter the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released.The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website.A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

    "body": "Kathy Ruemmler, former White House counsel, appears on \"Meet the Press\" in Washington, D.C., June 29, 2014.William B. Plowman | NBC Newswire | NBCUniversal | Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs on Thursday backed its top lawyer, Kathy Ruemmler, a day after a congressional committee released chummy emails she exchanged with notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before she joined the investment bank.Those emails feature Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel to former President Barack Obama, and Epstein exchanging thoughts about President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and overweight highway rest stop patrons.\"See you at 2, I ordered sushi for you,\" Epstein wrote Ruemmler in March 2018 as part of an email thread that began with him sending her a Daily Beast article headlined, \"How close is Donald Trump to a psychiatric breakdown?\"Those emails came about 17 months before Epstein's arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges. He killed himself weeks after that arrest in a Manhattan jail.Ruemmler is Goldman's chief legal officer and general counsel.Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto, in a statement to CNBC, said, \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs.\"\"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Fratto said.Ruemmler did not respond to requests for comment about her emails with Epstein on Thursday.In 2023, Ruemmler told The Wall Street Journal, \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"Ruemmler, who served as Obama's White House general counsel and as a federal prosecutor, exchanged emails with Epstein while she was a partner with the law firm Latham & Watkins, where she was global chair of the white-collar defense and investigations practice.The Journal in 2023 reported that Ruemmler \"had dozens of meetings with Epstein in the years after her White House service and before she became a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs ... in 2020.\"\"He also planned for her to join a 2015 trip to Paris and a 2017 visit to Epstein's private island in the Caribbean,\" the Journal reported then. The newspaper, citing a Goldman Sachs spokesman, reported that Epstein introduced her to potential legal clients, including Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.Goldman has previously said that Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Epstein connected to her role at Latham, but Latham also has said he was not a client of that firm.Her missives with Epstein, which the House oversight committee released Wednesday, were exchanged years after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in a Florida state court to prostitution charges involving an underage girl.Epstein served 13 months in jail in that case and was required to register as a sex offender.\"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" Ruemmler wrote to Epstein on Aug. 26, 2015, according to the email thread that Epstein's estate provided to the House committee pursuant to a subpoena.Epstein, who previously had been a longtime friend of Trump's, replied, \"ill give you details when I see you. when are you in ny?\"Ruemmler replied by saying she was going to New York two days later and was considering driving there.\"I will stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people,\" Ruemmler wrote.Months later, in January 2016, Epstein emailed Ruemmler, saying, \"I stopped talking to [Bill] Clinton when he swore, with whole hearted conviction to me, that he had done something. , he had forgotten that he also swore the exact opposite to me only weeks before.\"On July 14, 2016, Epstein writes Ruemmler: \"pretty black dress. you and ruth ginsburg.\"Ruemmler replied less than 20 minutes later: \"I like that dress ... narciso Rodriguez. Where did you see that picture? RBG [the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg] was my date to state dinner.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook on Jan. 21Epstein replied that the photo was on \"every news channel today,\" because Ginsburg had apologized for comments she made to the Times about Trump, in which she said, \"I can't imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president\" and that her late husband would have said it was \"time for us to move to New Zealand.\"\"Yikes,\" Ruemmler wrote.The following day, Epstein wrote a single word, \"today,\" to Ruemmler.She replied, \"that's a broad question,\" and he shot back, \"I no longer use terms like 'broad,'\" with a \"frown\" emoji following that.A year later, when Ginsburg's fears had been realized and Trump had been elected president, Ruemmler, on July 20, 2017, wrote, \"Trump is truly stupid.\"\"Duh,\" Epstein replied the following day.Ruemmler earlier that same year said in an email to Epstein that Trump was \"so gross.\"Epstein replied, \"Worse in real life and upclose.\"In August 2018, Ruemmler emailed Epstein a link to a New York Times op-ed that said there was a case to be made for impeaching Trump, in connection with hush money payments others made to two women to keep them quiet about their alleged sexual trysts with him before the 2016 election. Trump denies having sex with the women: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.Those payments were made and facilitated by Trump's then-personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, who agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in their investigation of Trump.\"You see, i know how dirty donald is,\" Epstein wrote in that thread. \"my guess is that non-lawyers ny biz people have no idea. what it means to have your fixer flip.\"In a thread earlier that year, Epstein appeared to have forwarded a message from former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon, who wrote, \"do you think Bill Clinton would like to join you me chud and steve? could be very funny, all off the record.\"Ruemmler replied, \"While he might like to, his lawyer would advise him against it. :-).\"In the same thread, Ruemmler wrote, \"Barf,\" after Epstein said that an unnamed woman was saying that a man named Ben was \"giving her a very hard time\" by asking her \"to do wife like things.\"In June 2018, Epstein, in an email to Ruemmler, mentioned Facebook and its founder, Zuckerberg.\"I thought you might like to look at the recent internet and privacy opinions and pose some open questions to be discussed,\" Epstein wrote. \"mark wants to bring the internet to the rest of the world ... and healthcare ... his wife is nice but boring .. what do you see as the challenges .. what does she or he see. social.\"— CNBC's Ashlee Trujillo, Caleigh Keating and MC Wellons contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about NVIDIA Omniverse as he delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday asked the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Friday that she had appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation.Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that \"Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.Because of that, he wrote, \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,.\"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" Trump wrote \"Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!\"Bondi, the attorney general, in a post on X, wrote, \"Thank you, Mr. President.\"\"SDNY U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton is one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country, and I've asked him to take the lead,\" Bondi wrote. \"As with all matters, the Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\"\"Trump should release all of the Epstein files: every person and every document in the files,\" Hoffman posted late on X on Friday. I want this complete release because it will bring justice for the victims.\"\"I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander. I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT,\" his post continued on X. \"The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein.\"\"I will do everything in my power going forward to advocate for the release of the files, to get justice for Epstein's victims, and to promote the values of truth our great country was founded on,\" Hoffman said. \"I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.\"Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner.A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, \"The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks.\"\"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,\" said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. \"We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley.In 2023, JPMorgan, without admitting wrongdoing, settled separate lawsuits by victims of Epstein and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, who had accused the bank of facilitating and benefiting from Epstein's sex trafficking of young women. The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesEmails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, \"I know how dirty donald is.\"In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: \"its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.\"Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.watch nowTrump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" The email does not explain what Epstein meant by thatIn another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added.",

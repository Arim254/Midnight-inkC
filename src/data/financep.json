    "body": "watch nowFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday condemned an investigation into her successor, Jerome Powell, saying it compromises the central bank's independence.Yellen, who served as Treasury secretary after leaving the Fed, added that she thinks financial markets should be more concerned about a situation that she called \"extremely chilling.\"\"I'm surprised the market isn't more concerned. It seems to me that the market should be concerned,\" Yellen said, according to CNBC's Sara Eisen.The comments come the day after Powell confirmed he'd been made aware that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., is looking into whether the central bank leader lied during testimony he provided to Congress last June about an expensive renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. The office is led by Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidante and former Fox News host. The Justice Department has not officially confirmed the investigation into what would be perjury charges.Yellen bristled at the notion that Powell might have lied.\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" she said.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks with CNBC from the New York Federal Reserve on Sept. 26th, 2024.David A. Grogan | CNBCYellen served during the first year of Trump's initial term as president but was replaced the following year by Powell after her term ended. She went on to serve under former President Joe Biden as the head of the Treasury, the first woman to hold either position.During her time at the Treasury, critics charged Yellen used the levers of debt issuance to underwrite a ballooning national debt. Trump has badgered the Fed to lower rates, in part to ease financing costs for a debt burden currently at $38.4 trillion.Yellen said using the Fed's key overnight borrowing rate to manage the debt is irresponsible.\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt,\" Yellen said, adding she \"completely [disagrees] with that. It is the road to a banana republic.\"Other former Fed and Treasury officials joined the chorus against the Powell investigation.\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the officials said in a statement. Signatories included former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson, and a number of prominent economists.\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly. It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement said.",

    "body": "A visitor takes a picture of a model of SK hynix's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology during the 2025 World IT Show in Seoul on April 24, 2025.Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korea-based memory maker SK Hynix announced Tuesday it will invest 19 trillion Korean won ($12.9 billion) to build a new advanced packaging plant, as it expands production to meet rising demands tied to artificial intelligence. The new facility will be located in the Korean city of Cheongju, building on the company's existing footprint there. Construction is set to begin in April, with completion targeted for the end of 2027, the firm said in a statement.The plant will focus on advanced packaging, which involves combining multiple memory chips into a single, high-density unit to improve performance and energy efficiency while reducing overall size.SK Hynix is among the world's largest producers of memory chips and leads in so-called high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is used in artificial intelligence processors, including those designed by U.S. chipmaker Nvidia. The investment comes as SK Hynix seeks to meet growing demand for HBM as global AI competition intensifies, a trend that has pushed up prices and made it lucrative for memory giants.SK Hynix rival Samsung Electronics has also announced plans to ramp up HBM production in recent months.According to industry projections cited by SK Hynix, the HBM market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 33% between 2025 and 2030.However, the process of producing HBM memory is much more demanding than that for memory used in most consumer electronics. As chipmakers shift to meet AI-driven demand, supplies of conventional memory have tightened, contributing to price hikes and raising concerns about higher costs across the broader electronics industry.TrendForce, a Taipei-based tech research firm, said last week that it expects average dynamic random access memory prices, including HBM, to rise by 50% to 55% this quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2025. Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM, generally refers to the primary, volatile memory found in most computers for temporary data storage.While higher memory prices have created challenges for electronics manufacturers, they have boosted earnings for memory producers. Samsung said last week it expects operating profit for the December quarter to nearly triple from the same period last year. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is weighing a potential U.S. listing following a blockbuster 2025 for its shares in South Korea. The stock is up about 12% since the start of this year, though it fell roughly 2.5% in Tuesday trading.",

    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance is suing Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav as its latest step in a hostile pursuit to acquire WBD, CEO David Ellison outlined in a letter to WBD shareholders on Monday. The lawsuit asks a Delaware court to direct Warner Bros. Discovery to provide information about its sale process and pending deal with Netflix. \"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison said in the letter on Monday. \"We filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer,\" Ellison said. Ellison also informed WBD shareholders on Monday that Paramount intends to nominate directors for election to WBD's board at the company's 2026 annual meeting, in a move that would add a proxy fight to the equation. Paramount's latest escalation comes days after WBD's board once again recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's amended offer, which was made in late December. The company has repeatedly said its offer is superior to the company's deal with Netflix and has previously argued that the sale process was unfairly skewed. \"Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer,\" Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement on Monday.  \"Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value. In spite of its multiple opportunities, Paramount Skydance continues to propose a transaction that our board unanimously concluded is not superior to the merger agreement with Netflix.\"Warner Bros. Discovery last month agreed to sell its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. The proposed deal was the result of a sale process in which Paramount was bidding for all of WBD's assets, including its portfolio of cable TV channels, known as Discovery Global. As part of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery plans to separate Discovery Global into its own publicly traded entity. Soon after WBD reached a deal with Netflix, Paramount went public with its hostile bid. Paramount has offered $30 per share, all cash for all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets. WBD's board told shareholders in December to reject the initial offer in favor of the Netflix deal, citing concerns about the backing of Ellison's father, billionaire Larry Ellison. Paramount responded with an amended offer in which the Oracle co-founder agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. Paramount has stopped short of increasing the size of its bid, however. The newly merged Paramount Skydance first took interest in Warner Bros. Discovery in the fall, making three unsolicited offers that were each rejected. Warner Bros. Discovery then opened up a sale process seeking offers for some or all of its company. At the same time, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would carry on with a plan that was announced earlier in the year to split its company into two publicly traded entities — Warner Bros., consisting of the streaming platform HBO Max and film studio, and Discovery Global, comprised of the pay TV networks like TNT and CNN.

    "body": "ReutersSen. Mark Kelly on Monday sued the Pentagon and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, alleging the Trump administration's efforts to punish the Arizona Democrat for his participation in a video to U.S. troops violate the Constitution.The federal civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was filed one week after Hegseth said his department would cut Kelly's military retirement pay in response to the video.The government's actions \"trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence,\" Kelly's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, which was also filed against the U.S. Navy Department and its secretary, John Phelan.\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" the lawyers wrote.The legal complaint alleges that the defendants violated Kelly's right to freedom of speech, as well as his protection under the Constitution's \"speech or debate clause,\" which prevents executive action against members of Congress for their legislative conduct. The suit also alleges infringements of Kelly's due process rights and the separation of powers, among other violations.A Pentagon official told CNBC in a statement that the department is aware of the lawsuit, but that its policy is not to comment on ongoing litigation.The video at the center of the fight featured Kelly and five other congressional Democrats delivering a message addressed to U.S. troops and members of the intelligence community.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly said in the 90-second video, which was first posted on social media on Nov. 18.It was shared as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs.Members of Congress, including some Republicans, had questioned the legality of those deadly strikes, which were made without congressional authorization. The attacks have continued, killing 123 people since early September, according to The New York Times.The other lawmakers in the video, who all served in the military or in U.S. intelligence, each made a similar statement about troops being allowed to refuse unlawful orders.But Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, is the only one who formally retired from service, and therefore remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Days later, Hegseth slammed the video as \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" while labeling its participants the \"Seditious Six.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

    "body": "A Venezuelan living in Colombia waves a Venezuelan flag and a U.S. flag at Plaza de Bolivar to celebrate after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, in Bogota, Colombia, Jan. 3, 2026. Andres Galeano | ReutersVenezuela's stock market has not only shrugged off the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces, it has surged to a record high as investors bet that the battered economy could finally see a turnaround.The country's benchmark Indice Bursatil de Capitalizacion, or IBC, has gained more than 130% since the U.S. operation on Jan. 3. The rally reflects optimism that Venezuela's economy could stabilize after years of mismanagement, sanctions and defaults, with expectations growing that a reconfigured government may attract capital, revive oil output and normalize relations with the United States, analysts said.And investors are trying to get in on the action. U.S. ETF issuer Teucrium on Friday applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to create what would reportedly be the first exchange-traded fund focused on companies with exposure to Venezuela. \"In what is a fluid environment, we currently believe that Venezuela is more likely to experience regime continuity with behavioral realignment, rather than an outright democratic transition or system collapse,\" BMI said in a note. \"A pliant Venezuela would allow the U.S. to reinforce its regional hegemony, secure access to the oil sector on very favorable terms.\"\"Investors began to price in Maduro's removal from power as a precondition for sanctions relief and eventually a restructuring deal,\" said Anthony Simond, investment director at UK-based wealth and investments firm Aberdeen.Simond said demand is coming from a broad mix of investors, including mainstream emerging-market asset managers, as well as hedge funds and distressed-debt specialists seeking asymmetric upside. However, it is important to note that Venezuela's stock exchange is small, illiquid and not easily accessible to global investors, meaning price swings can be extreme, strategists said. Venezuela's IBC soared 1,644% in 2025.\"Because Venezuela's markets are thinly traded, even small shifts in expectations can cause large price moves,\" Alice Blue, an integrated brokerage of financial charting platform TradingView wrote in a note. \"The rally reflects hope and speculation, not confirmed outcomes.\"Investors have also rushed into the country's sovereign and state oil company bonds since Maduro was captured. Renewed interest in Venezuelan bonds is primarily driven by optimism around potential debt restructuring, a development investors see as a way to unlock value frozen since Venezuela's 2017 default, said Jeff Grills, head of U.S. cross markets and emerging markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. Grills cautioned though that much of the stock rally is headline-driven. \"At this stage, the rally appears to be largely tactical, rather than the start of a structural re-rating,\" he said, noting that leadership changes alone do not yet amount to a full regime transition. Venezuela's external liabilities, including arbitration claims and bilateral debts — estimated at $150 billion to $170 billion, according to Reuters — complicates any recovery timeline, said Eric Fine, a portfolio manager from VanEck.\"Everything depends on that not being derailed. [However] if that materializes, this is a complete re-rating situation,\" he said.",

    "body": "Australia blocked teens from using social media in December in a new regulation.George Chan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesMeta has issued new pleas to the Australian government to reconsider its recently enforced social media ban for under 16s, after the tech giant blocked over half a million accounts on its platforms in one month. Australia's Online Safety Amendment Act 2024 came into effect on Dec. 11, barring access to 10 major services including Meta's Instagram,  Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat, and Elon Musk's X. Meta has since removed nearly 550,000 accounts believed to belong to under-16s between Dec. 4-11, it said in a blog post on Sunday. On Instagram, it removed around 330,000 accounts, around 173,500 on Facebook, and nearly 40,000 on Threads. \"As we've stated previously, Meta is committed to meeting its compliance obligations and is taking the necessary steps to remain compliant with the law,\" Meta said in the post. \"That said, we call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans.\" The company said it worked with OpenAge Initiative, a non profit organization, to launch age verification tolls called Age Keys — users can then verify their age via government-issued ID, financial information, face estimation, or national digital wallets. However, it highlighted that age verification and parental approval needs to extend to the app store level, as teens use over 40 apps a week and many of these don't use age verification tools or prioritize safety, or be in the scope of the Australian law. \"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law,\" it added. Australia's Online Safety Amendment Act 2024 came into effect on Dec. 11.Xavier Lorenzo | Moment | Getty ImagesMeta previously shared its disapproval of the new law saying \"cutting teens off from their friends and communities isn't the answer,\" and emphasized that some will will find other ways to access social media sites \"without the safeguards provided to registered users.\"Since the ban, many Australian teens have found ways to circumvent the law including turning to alternative social media platforms that are not yet banned including Snapchat-alternative Yope, Bytedance's video and photo-sharing app Lemon8, and messaging platform Discord. Additionally, other under 16s told Sky News that they're using VPNs or their parent's social media account. Meta is not the only platform to question the ban. Reddit has gone as far as to launch a legal challenge against Australia saying the new law is ineffective and limits political discussion. It can isolate teens \"from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions),\" Reddit said in prior comments to CNBC. It added in its application that \"the political views of children inform the electoral choices of many current electors, including their parents and their teachers, as well as others interested in the views of those soon to reach the age of maturity.\"In a video on X, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese explained that the ban would give back power to parents and families from big tech firms, and would allow \"kids to be kids.\" The ban decreases the likelihood of teens being exposed to stressful or harmful content, said Australia's eSafety Commissionerm, adding that it also shifts the responsibility on teen social media usage from parents to tech companies.Mental health harms Australia's social media ban for under 16s may influence other countries to follow suit, as lawmakers and parents continue to grapple with the negative mental health impact that such platforms are having on younger users. In 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned of a teen mental health crisis due to social media, in a report that linked social media use with increase depression, anxiety, as well as for perpetuating eating disorders, body dysmorphia and low self-esteem. The concerns have sparked the rise of parent-led organizations worldwide that aim to restrict their children from using smartphones. Such movements include the Smartphone Free Childhood group in the U.K., Austin-based Wait Until 8th, Unplugged in Canada, No Es Momento in Mexico, and the Heads Up Alliance in Australia.Read moreJonathan Haidt, NYU professor and the author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is a major figure in the movement to protect children from smartphones and social media. Haidt advises that teenagers shouldn't have smartphones before the age of 14, and shouldn't have access to social media before 16-years-old. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is hoping for a long-term mental health shift as a result of the ban, but in the immediate aftermath, results have been mixed. A BBC report that involved interviews with Australian teens found that while some have changed their habits for the better, other teens felt more isolated and disconnected without social media, or were finding workarounds.

    "body": "Tech investors are sounding out how the U.S. taking Greenland would affect the viability of critical and rare earth minerals mining there, CNBC has learned, as Washington ramps up its pursuit of the Arctic island.Greenland has found itself at the center of a geopolitical firestorm over the past week as the U.S. has threatened to annex the self-governing Danish territory, citing national security concerns. Commercial opportunities have also come into the spotlight.In the past week, Critical Metals Corp, a company with a mining project in development on the Arctic island, has fielded questions from tech investors about how the U.S. acquiring Greenland would impact that asset and its development strategy, CEO Tony Sage told CNBC. The NASDAQ-listed company's stock is up 116% since the start of 2026.The project is in the early stages of building a plant to extract heavy rare earth elements (HREE), which can be used to provide heat resistance and magnetic stability in advanced technology ranging from EVs to AI data center infrastructure.Sage said U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Greenland had generated additional \"buzz\" for the project from investors. Without naming specific shareholders, he said Critical Metals Corp backers included those who invest in Magnificent Seven U.S. tech companies.Last week, the CEO of Amaroq, a mining company with projects in Greenland, told CNBC it was having discussions with U.S. government bodies about potential investment opportunities in the territory.The White House has said it's \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland, though it hasn't ruled out military action to acquire the territory, ahead of planned talks this week between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish officials. Mining in GreenlandInterest in critical minerals and rare earth mining in Greenland from tech investors has picked up in the past year. In January 2025, Trump reasserted his desire to acquire the territory — a massive, strategically-placed island with a population of just 57,000 — ahead of taking office.Amaroq chief Eldur Ólafsson said the company had seen an increase in attention from investors, including tech investors, over the last 12 months, in an interview with CNBC last week, as geopolitical tensions brought supply chains for critical minerals into focus.In November, the company said that \"commercial levels\" of germanium and gallium, critical minerals that are crucial for building advanced AI chips, were present in a mining project it owns in Greenland. \"When Trump put tariffs on China, the first two metals China stopped exporting were germanium and gallium,\" Ólafsson told CNBC. \"Why? Because you need it in AI, you need it in defense, you need it in tech, it's absolutely critical.\"watch nowChina's export ban on several rare earth minerals in 2025 highlighted to tech investors the challenge of the country's dominance in the space, said Critical Metals Corp's Sage. \"The heavy rare earths, which include Yttrium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium, and Gallium are the minerals that generate the most interest,\" he told CNBC. \"These are the materials that are essential for defence technologies, robotics, semiconductors and aerospace applications. We can't fly rockets into space, build nuclear submarines or next-generation fighter jets without these materials.\"Sage added that Critical Metals Corp had \"strong relationships\" with the governments of both Greenland and the U.S. and did not expect its plans to change.The company's stock surged 62% in a day in October after Reuters reported the U.S. Government was considering buying a stake. It shed the gains to finish 2025 up 2% for the year.Others are more skeptical about whether Greenland's critical and rare earth minerals can significantly reduce the West's dependence on China, which produced 70% of rare earths in 2024, according to Statista. \"Getting rare earths from exploration to the mighty magnet involves five to six distinct stages — and right now, what's in Greenland is still only in the exploration stage,\" Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director at industry group the Critical Minerals Institute, told CNBC.\"Rare earths in Greenland won't materially move markets in the next decade,\" she added.",

Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he wrote.Further details about the tariff announcement were not immediately clear. A White House official declined to answer CNBC's questions about the president's social media post.The apparent effort by Trump to economically isolate Iran comes as the oil-rich Middle Eastern country struggles to suppress an ongoing swell of massive anti-government protests.Dozens of those protesters have reportedly been killed in recent weeks; Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if the killings continue.The president has also explicitly encouraged the demonstrations against the Iranian regime. \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" he wrote on social media on Saturday.The announcement of new tariffs on Iran's business partners also comes ahead of a much-anticipated Supreme Court ruling on whether many of Trump's most expansive tariffs are legal.Those tariffs — including his controversial \"reciprocal\" duties from early April and others related to purported fentanyl trafficking — were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. It was unclear if Trump's newly unveiled Iran-related tariffs also rest on that law. This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" he added.That position substantially complicates the road to replacing Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. The banking committee, of which Tillis is a member, has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so even one defection sets up a stalemate.Tillis usually supports Trump but occasionally has broken with the president. For instance, he was one of just two GOP senators to vote against the \"one big beautiful bill\" spending package last year. Tillis is retiring from the Senate when his term ends.Powell's position isn't the only one at stake.Stephen Miran's term as governor ends in January, and there has been chatter about potential retirements, particularly Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.However, news that the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidant and former Fox News host, is investigating Powell for perjury clouds the situation. Powell on Sunday released a statement acknowledging the investigation and alleging it is a pretext for giving Trump power over the Fed.\"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" Powell said.Tillis isn't the only banking panel member to criticize Trump over the move.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who once called Powell \"a dangerous man\" and opposed his reappointment, accused Trump of wanting a \"sock puppet\" to lead the Fed and do his bidding by lowering interest rates.\"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,\" Warren said in a statement.While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he can stay on as governor until 2028. He has not indicated yet whether he will do so.The White House has been conducting an extensive search for the new chair, with the candidate field whittled down to five. Trump has indicated he will put forth a nominee this month.CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.",

    "body": "watch nowRepublican protests are growing louder on Capitol Hill as the Trump administration's Department of Justice pursues a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell on Sunday night revealed that the Justice Department opened an investigation into his handling of renovations to the central bank's headquarters and his testimony about the matter to Congress. Powell said the investigation was an attempt to intimidate him by \"threatening a criminal indictment\" as he lowers interest rates at a slower pace than President Donald Trump desires. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro on Monday defended the investigation in a post to X and downplayed that a potential indictment is coming, arguing the \"word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's.\"\"The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,\" Pirro said. \"None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach. This office makes decisions based on the merits, nothing more and nothing less.\"The GOP resistance could derail Trump's eventual pick to succeed Powell when the Fed chief's term is up in May, as North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, threatens to block any nominee to the central bank until the investigation is resolved. Tillis' comments are now being echoed by other Republicans. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote in a post on X, that the \"administration's investigation is nothing more than an attempt at coercion,\" and called for a congressional investigation into the matter. \"If the Department of Justice believes an investigation into Chair Powell is warranted based on project cost overruns—which are not unusual—then Congress needs to investigate the Department of Justice,\" Murkowski said. \"The stakes are too high to look the other way: if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, the stability of our markets and the broader economy will suffer. My colleague, Senator Tillis, is right in blocking any Federal Reserve nominees until this is resolved.\" Tillis' block is a massive problem for Trump, who has long sought to oust Powell and replace him with an ally. The Banking Committee is comprised of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection can cause a deadlock and block a nominee from advancing. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to replace Powell when his term as Fed chair is up in May. However, Powell could stay on as a governor until 2028. And the chorus of Republicans criticizing the administration over the investigation is only getting louder as fears intensify about politicizing the central bank. Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters on Monday that the investigation \"raise[s] a lot of disturbing questions.\" \"This potential indictment is not something I ever would have expected,\" Collins said, noting that she had not yet reviewed the comments Powell made that the Justice Department is investigating. \"And one can't help but wonder if that's more to do with the chairman's resistance to the pressure from the White House when it comes to the interest rates.\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who sits on the Banking Committee, warned that further conflict between the Fed and the White House could cause economic turmoil. \"I know Chairman Powell very well, I will be stunned, I will be shocked if he has done anything wrong,\" Kennedy said. \"If you wanted to design a system to guarantee that interest rates would go up and not down, the best way to do that would be to have the Federal Reserve and the executive branch of the United States get in a pissing contest.\"\"We need this like we need a hole in the head,\" Kennedy said. Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, also weighed in on the matter. \"Pursuing criminal charges relating to his testimony on building renovations at a time when the nation's economy requires focus and creates an unnecessary distraction,\" Hill said. \"The Federal Reserve is led by strong, capable individuals appointed by President Trump, and this action could undermine this and future Administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions,\" he said. Even Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Banking Committee member who is a frequent Powell critic, criticized the investigation. \"Jerome Powell is a bad Fed Chair who has been elusive with Congress, especially regarding the overruns of the elaborate renovations of the building,\" Cramer said. \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest quickly, along with the remainder of Jerome Powell's term. We need to restore confidence in the Fed.\"CNBC has reached out to Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., for comment on the investigation into Powell.Trump does have one ally, however, in his administration's push to investigate Powell: Sen Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. \"Whether Chairman Powell was unprepared for his testimony or intentionally misled Congress about the Fed's extravagant spending, the American people deserve answers. I will wait for the DOJ to release its findings before commenting further,\" Lummis said.  CNBC has reached out to the White House for a response to the members' complaints. This story is developing.

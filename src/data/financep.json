    "body": "Henrique Braun to become the next CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.Courtesy: The Coca-Cola CompanyCoca-Cola Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun will succeed James Quincey as CEO next year, the company said Wednesday, as Coke and its rivals navigate tepid consumer demand for soft drinks.The change will take effect on March 31, and Braun will be nominated to the company's board of directors, Coca-Cola said. Quincey will stay on with the company as executive chairman of its board.Quincey, 60, has held the top job at the beverage giant since 2017. During that time, he oversaw the refranchising of Coke's bottling system, the company's strategy through the Covid pandemic and its focus on beverages perceived as healthier.Braun, 57, has held various roles at Coke since joining the company in 1996, the same year that Quincey joined. Braun became COO at the beginning of the year. In a release, Coca-Cola said Braun will focus on identifying new growth opportunities around the world, better filling consumer needs and improving the company's technology.James Quincey, Coca-Cola CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBCThe leadership change comes as the beverage company tries to reverse slower demand for its sodas, which still account for a significant amount of its global sales. In Coke's third-quarter, global unit case volume — which strips out pricing and foreign currency changes — rose 1% after falling in the previous three-month period. Quincey has said lower-income consumers have bought fewer of its drinks, and the company has rolled out cheaper and smaller versions of its products to try to reverse the trend. However, pricier brands like Smartwater and Fairlife have performed better than its soda segment in recent quarters, suggesting that consumers are willing to pay more for some brands. Coca-Cola has also largely outperformed rival Pepsico during Quincey's tenure, in part due to its stronger out-of-home business in venues like restaurants and movie theaters. Coke is also winning the soda wars. Its namesake soda has held onto its spot as the best-selling soda in the U.S., and Sprite surpassed Pepsi to become the No. 3 soda in the nation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCoke's stock has outperformed Pepsi's in recent years.Coke shares were largely unchanged in extended trading Wednesday. The company's stock has climbed nearly 13% this year, while Pepsi shares have fallen more than 1%.Coke's market cap of more than $300 billion outstrips that of Pepsi, which has a market value of roughly $200 billion.",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly logo appears on the company’s office in San Diego, California, U.S., Nov. 21, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly on Thursday said its next-generation obesity drug delivered what appears to be the highest weight loss yet in a late-stage trial while reducing knee arthritis pain, clearing the first of several upcoming studies on the weekly injection. The highest dose of the drug helped patients with obesity and a type of knee arthritis lose an average of 23.7% of their body weight at 68 weeks, when analyzing all participants, including those who discontinued treatment. The company said some patients lost so much weight that they decided to drop out of the trial. When evaluating only patients who stayed on the drug – essentially the best-case scenario – the highest dose delivered 28.7% weight loss on average. Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 2% in premarket trading Thursday. It is the first late-stage data on the retatrutide, which works differently from existing injections and appears to be more effective. Eli Lilly is betting big on retatrutide as the next pillar of its obesity portfolio after its weight loss injection Zepbound and its upcoming pill. But it's still unclear when the drug could enter the market. It's a critical part of the drugmaker's plan to maintain its market share majority over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Some analysts estimate the segment could be worth about $100 billion by the 2030s.Retatrutide also met the trial's other main goal of reducing pain from knee osteoarthritis – a common condition that wears down the joint's cartilage and leads to pain and stiffness – by up to 62.6% on average when analyzing all patients, based on a widely used survey. More than one in eight patients who took the drug were completely free from knee pain by the end of the trial, Eli Lilly said. The results appear to supass Wall Street's expectations. In a note ahead of the findings, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said his base case assumption was for the drug to show weight loss of around 20% to 23%, with at least a 50% reduction in knee pain. The company believes retatrutide \"could become an important option for patients with significant weight loss needs and certain complications, including knee osteoarthritis,\" Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in a statement. But roughly 18% of patients on the highest dose of the drug stopped treatment due to side effects, compared to 4% of those in the placebo group. Eli Lilly said those dropout rates were \"highly correlated\" to patients' starting BMI and included discontinuations due to \"perceived excessive weight loss.\" Around 43% of patients on the highest dose experienced nausea, while roughly 33% and 20.9% had diarrhea and vomiting, respectively. More than one in five patients on the highest dose also experienced dysesthesia, which is an unpleasant nerve sensation. The company said it was generally mild for patients and rarely led to them discontinuing treatment. The study, called TRIUMPH-4, didn't solely focus on weight loss, meaning that other trials specifically designed for that outcome could produce different or higher results. Eli Lilly expects to report findings from seven additional phase three trials on the drug by the end of 2026. Dubbed the \"triple G\" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones – GLP-1, GIP and glucagon – rather than just one or two like existing treatments. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments.Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's weight loss shot Zepbound, mimics GLP-1 and GIP. Novo Nordisk's obesity drug Wegovy mimics only GLP-1.Higher doses of tirzepatide helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their body weight on average in late-stage studies.As Eli Lilly establishes an edge in the space, its chief rival Novo Nordisk is racing to catch up. In March, Novo Nordisk said it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from the Chinese pharmaceutical company United Laboratories International. Novo Nordisk's newly acquired drug is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar. But Novo Nordisk's treatment is much earlier in development, meaning it will take several years before it reaches patients. ",

Global benchmark Brent rose 71 cents, or 1.15%, to $62.65 a barrel. Trump has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks. The president said Maduro's \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. He would not rule out a ground invasion of the South American nation.\"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump told Politico. The White House has undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean and launched controversial, deadly strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler. \"Shippers will likely be much more cautious and hesitant about loading Venezuelan crude going forward,\" Smith said. — CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on December 10, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a much-anticipated quarter percentage point interest rate cut at a meeting that was packed with intrigue and surprises. Here's a look at five top takeaways:The hawkish cut is real — kind of. Wall Street had been anticipating the Fed would deliver a strong dose of caution along with the cut, with a warning that the bar was high for additional easing. Markets, though, didn't seem to mind: Stocks posted solid gains on the day while Treasury yields fell.While a 9-3 vote might suggest broad support for the move, the Federal Open Market Committee is different. Three dissents is a lot, the most, in fact, since September 2019. And one of the \"no\" votes came from an unexpected source: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. Governor Stephen Miran wanted a half-point cut, while Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favored holding steady. A total of six of the 19 participants at the meeting said they wouldn't have voted for the cut, giving voice to \"soft dissents\" who think the easing has gone far enough.The dots held. In short, the \"dot plot\" of individual officials' rate views were little changed for the coming years, with the median indicating just one cut in 2026 and another in 2027 before the fed funds rate settles around a neutral 3%. Markets largely took the committee at its word, though futures pricing late in the day pointed to a non-negligible 38% chance of two cuts next year.Bond buying is back. Well, not really bonds, but bills, which the Fed will start buying again come Friday. With overnight funding markets feeling pressure, the central bank said it will buy $40 billion of short-term bills as part of a monthly program aimed at stabilizing markets and keeping the fed funds rate within its quarter-point range. Buying levels will change, but some market participants viewed the announcement as a stealth easing that is positive for risk assets.Chair Jerome Powell was mostly upbeat about growth, and so was the committee. \"We have an extraordinary economy,\" said Powell, who has just three meetings left as chair. FOMC officials raised their view as well, boosting the outlook for 2026 gross domestic product growth by half a percentage point to 2.3%.What they're saying\"Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed Chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while. Still, continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25 bps cut into the mix for January.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a reported finalist to succeed Powell\"The Fed's guidance probably tells us less than usual about the interest rate outlook, for two big reasons. First, they know less than usual about the current state of the economy because the shutdown delayed the release of economic statistics. Second, the Fed's guidance doesn't account for how its approach will change after Chair Powell's term ends in May. In 2026, the Fed seems more likely to cut rates by more than signaled in the December Dot Plot than by less.\" — Bill Adams, chief economist, Comerica Bank\"The Fed lifted its expectations of growth next year which, along with the increase in cash to American households via changing tax policy, will create doubt about the path of monetary policy. This dynamic in our estimation substantially lifts the bar on any prospective rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in January.\" — Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist, RSM",

    "body": "Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesNvidia is developing software that could provide location verification for its AI graphics processing units (GPUs), a move that comes as Washington ramps up efforts to prevent restricted chips from being used in countries like China.The opt-in service uses a client software agent that Nvidia chip customers can install to monitor the health of their AI GPUs, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday. Nvidia also said that customers \"will be able to visualize their GPU fleet utilization in a dashboard, globally or by compute zones — groups of nodes enrolled in the same physical or cloud locations.\"However, Nvidia told CNBC in a statement that the latest software does not give the company or outside actors the ability to disable its chips.\"There is no kill switch,\" it added. \"For GPU health, there are no features that allow NVIDIA to remotely control or take action on registered systems. It is read-only telemetry sent to NVIDIA.\"Telemetry is the automated process of collecting and transmitting data from remote or inaccessible sources to a central location for monitoring, analysis and optimization.The ability to locate a device depends on the type of sensor data collected and transmitted, such as IP-based network information, timestamps, or other system-level signals that can be mapped to physical or cloud locations.A screenshot of the software posted on Nvidia's blog showed details such as the machine's IP address and location.A screenshot of the software posted on Nvidia's blog showed details such as the machine's IP address and location.Nvidia blog screenshot | Opt-In NVIDIA Software Enables Data Center Fleet ManagementLukasz Olejnik, a senior research fellow at the Department of War Studies, King's College London, said that while Nvidia indicated that its GPUs do not have hardware tracking technology, the blog did not specify if the data \"uses customer input, network data, cloud provider metadata, or other methods.\"\"In principle, also, the sent data contains metadata like network address, which may enable location in practice,\" Olejnik, who is also an independent consultant, told CNBC. The software could also detect any unexpected usage patterns that differ from what was declared, he added.The latest features from Nvidia follow calls by lawmakers in Washington for the company to outfit its chips with tracking software that could help enforce export controls. Those rules bar Nvidia from selling its more advanced AI chips to companies in China and other prohibited locations without a special license. While Trump has recently said he plans to roll back some of these export restrictions, those on Nvidia's cutting-edge chips will remain in place.  In May, Senator Tom Cotton and a bipartisan group of eight lawmakers introduced the Chip Security Act, which, if passed, would mandate security mechanisms and location verification in advanced AI chips. \"Firms affected by U.S. export controls or China-related restrictions could use the system to verify and prove their GPU fleets remain in approved locations and state, and demonstrate compliant usage to regulators,\" Olejn noted.\"That could actually help in compliance and indirectly on investment outlook positively.\"Pressure on Nvidia has intensified after Justice Department investigations into alleged smuggling rings that moved over $160 million in Nvidia chips to China.However, Chinese officials have pushed back, warning Nvidia against equipping its chips with tracking features, as well as \"potential backdoors and vulnerabilities.\" Following a national security investigation into some of Nvidia's chips to check for these backdoors, Chinese officials have prevented local tech companies from purchasing products from the American chip designer. Despite a green light from U.S. President Donald Trump for Nvidia to ship its previously restricted H200 chips to China, Beijing is reportedly undecided about whether to  permit the imports.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point could have been \"at least doubled.\"Trump, who has long urged the central bank to slash rates in order to spur further economic growth, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut.Trump, during a roundtable meeting with CEOs at the White House, also said he plans to interview former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh later Wednesday. Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett are two of the top contenders to succeed Powell when his term ends in May.\"I'm looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates,\" Trump said, before adding, \"Our rate should be much lower.\"Powell has been a major target of criticism from Trump, who believes the Fed has been too slow to lower rates during the first year of his second presidential term.Trump also lamented what he described as the tendency to raise interest rates in the wake of strong economic results.  \"We're going to go back to the old days,\" Trump said at the roundtable. \"When we announced great results, it doesn't mean we're going to raise interest rates and try and kill it.\"The president's comments came shortly after the Fed announced the 25-basis-point cut, its third of the year. The decision was the middle-ground choice among a divided Fed: Two of the members preferred not to change rates, while Stephen Miran, a Trump administration economic official, favored a larger cut.Powell, at a news conference later Wednesday, said the latest cut was a \"close call\" that gives the Fed room to \"wait and see how the economy evolves.\"He also directly blamed Trump's tariffs for the nation's \"somewhat elevated\" inflation level. \"These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the effects of tariffs,\" Powell said, citing the rise in two key inflation gauges.",

    "body": "Jyoti Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Harness, speaks at the company's Unscripted conference in London on Sept. 25, 2025.HarnessAlmost nine years ago, Jyoti Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion just as the software startup was set to go public. Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs.Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI. In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.Harness is on track to exceed its goal of over $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco. Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time. \"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term,\" Bansal said. In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to longstanding employees.WATCH: 'Vibe-coding's' evil twin?

The forecast is the same from its projection from last quarter.The Fed on Wednesday cut its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, marking its third reduction of 2025.Here are the Fed's latest targets from 19 FOMC members, both voters and nonvoters:The Fed's 2026 rate outlook was the most crucial data point traders were focused on as the central bank has become increasingly divided. There were three dissents from Wednesday's decision – Governor Stephen Miran favored a steeper half-point reduction while regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Austan Goolsbee of Chicago backed holding the line.On top of the two \"no\" dovish votes on the rate cut, four other nonvoting meeting participants indicated that they did not go along with the decision. Seven officials also indicated they want no cuts next year, according to the dot plot.For 2027, the Fed projected the terminal rate hitting 3.1%, indicating one further rate cut. The rate is expected to remain unchanged in 2028, according to the dot plot.— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks with CNBC during the Invest i America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.CNBCThere were three dissenters from the Federal Reserve's decision to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, making it the most divisive the central bank has been in more than six years. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joined Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in voting for no decrease. The newest member, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran, again called for a  half-point cut. It is the third dissent in a row for Miran, who called for a half-point rate cut in both the October and September meetings. Schmid also called for no decrease in October.The last time there were three dissents during a Fed meeting was in September 2019.In addition, there were four other so-called soft dissents by nonvoting meeting participants. The policymakers submitted a forecast for interest rates to have ended the year at the previous level of 3.75 percent to 4 percent.\"'Hard dissents' from voting members as well as the 'soft dissents' seen in the dot plot highlight the Fed's hawkish bloc, and the return of 'extent and timing' language to the statement regarding future policy decisions was likely done to appease them,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"While this leaves the door open to future cuts, labor market weakness will have to clear a high bar,\" he added.However, Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said that the dissents against the rate cuts may not necessarily offer a window into next year's moves. \"The dissents ruled against a faster pace of rate cuts today, but the winds of change are in the air,\" he said. \"A new Fed Chair in 2026, and perhaps many more new Fed officials, means more interest rate cuts are coming next year as rate cuts are big on the Trump 2.0 economic agenda even if not listed explicitly, if for nothing else but to weigh against the slowing economy due to the import tariffs uncertainty.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting.Correction: The last time there were three dissents during a Fed meeting was in September 2019.

Rachel Wisniewski | ReutersThe Trump administration said Wednesday that it has pulled nearly 10,000 commercial truck drivers off U.S. roadways for failing to speak English sufficiently.The boast comes as trucking companies have raised alarms about drivers being targeted by President Donald Trump's immigration agenda.\"We've now knocked 9,500 truck drivers out of service for failing to speak our national language — ENGLISH!\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an X post.\"This administration will always put you and your family's safety first,\" Duffy said.Duffy was responding to a report by Bloomberg that detailed fallout in the trucking industry from a new language policy and other rules.The industry – which was already grappling with declining freight volumes and rising overheads – is bracing for a significant drop in the supply of drivers because of the federal government's enforcement actions, Bloomberg reported.Trump signed an executive order in early March designating English as the country's official language.In April, the president signed another order directing Duffy to ensure that commercial truck drivers who fail to meet English proficiency requirements are taken out of service.That order rescinded an Obama-era policy, which the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration says directed personnel to issue citations to commercial drivers who violate English standards, but not remove them from service.The strengthened enforcement policy went into effect in late June. Texas and Wyoming have seen the largest number of drivers out of the more than 9,500 who have been pulled from the road, Bloomberg reported.The Trump administration has drawn links between the surge in immigration during the administration of former President Joe Biden and road safety concerns.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

The cloud computing and database software maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Wednesday, despite booming demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Its revenue came in at $16.06 billion, compared with $16.21 billion expected by analysts, according to data compiled by LSEG.It dragged other AI-related names down with it. Chip darling Nvidia was last seen down 1.5% in premarket trading, memory and storage firm Micron was 1.4% lower, tech heavyweight Microsoft dipped 0.9%, cloud company Coreweave slid 3% and AMD was 1.3% in negative territory. watch nowOracle has been the subject of much market chatter since raising $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale in September, marking one of the largest debt issuances for the tech industry on record. The name shot onto investor agendas when it inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in the same month. Oracle made further moves into cloud infrastructure, where it battles Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google for AI contracts.Global investors have questioned Oracle's aggressive AI infrastructure build-out plans and whether it needs such a colossal amount of debt to execute, though other tech firms have also recently issued corporate bonds. Oracle specifically has secured billions of dollars of construction loans through a consortium of banks tied to data centers in New Mexico and Wisconsin. The firm will raise roughly $20 billion to $30 billion in debt every year for the next three years, according to estimates by Citi analyst Tyler Radke.Its share price has moved 34% higher year-to-date despite recent losses.

    "body": "The Starcloud-1 satellite is launched into space from a SpaceX rocket on November 2, 2025.Courtesy: SpaceX | StarcloudNvidia-backed startup Starcloud trained an artificial intelligence model from space for the first time, signaling a new era for orbital data centers that could alleviate Earth's escalating digital infrastructure crisis. Last month, the Washington-based company launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit, sending a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before. Now, the company's Starcloud-1 satellite is running and querying responses from Gemma, an open large language model from Google, in orbit, marking the first time in history that an LLM has been run on a high-powered Nvidia GPU in outer space, CNBC has learned. \"Greetings, Earthlings! Or, as I prefer to think of you — a fascinating collection of blue and green,\" reads a message from the recently launched satellite. \"Let's see what wonders this view of your world holds. I'm Gemma, and I'm here to observe, analyze, and perhaps, occasionally offer a slightly unsettlingly insightful commentary. Let's begin!\" the model wrote.Starcloud's output Gemma in space. Gemma is a family of open models built from the same technology used to create Google's Gemini AI models.StarcloudStarcloud wants to show outer space can be a hospitable environment for data centers, particularly as Earth-based facilities strain power grids, consume billions of gallons of water annually and produce hefty greenhouse gas emissions. The electricity consumption of data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, according to data from the International Energy Agency.Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston told CNBC that the company's orbital data centers will have 10 times lower energy costs than terrestrial data centers.\"Anything you can do in a terrestrial data center, I'm expecting to be able to be done in space. And the reason we would do it is purely because of the constraints we're facing on energy terrestrially,\" Johnston said in an interview.Johnston, who co-founded the startup in 2024, said Starcloud-1's operation of Gemma is proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of AI models in the future, particularly those that require large compute clusters. \"This very powerful, very parameter dense model is living on our satellite,\" Johnston said. \"We can query it, and it will respond in the same way that when you query a chat from a database on Earth, it will give you a very sophisticated response. We can do that with our satellite.\"In a statement to CNBC, Tris Warkentin, product director at Google DeepMind, said that \"seeing Gemma run in the harsh environment of space is a testament to the flexibility and robustness of open models.\" In addition to Gemma, Starcloud was able to train NanoGPT, an LLM created by OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy, on the H100 chip using the complete works of Shakespeare. This led the model to speak in Shakespearean English.Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way.Philip JohnstonStarcloud CEO Starcloud — a member of the Nvidia Inception program and graduate from Y Combinator and the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator — plans to build a 5-gigawatt orbital data center with solar and cooling panels that measure roughly 4 kilometers in both width and height. A compute cluster of that gigawatt size would produce more power than the largest power plant in the U.S. and would be substantially smaller and cheaper than a terrestrial solar farm of the same capacity, according to Starcloud's white paper.These data centers in space would capture constant solar energy to power next-generation AI models, unhindered by the Earth's day and night cycles and weather changes. Starcloud's satellites should have a five-year lifespan given the expected lifetime of the Nvidia chips on its architecture, Johnston said. Orbital data centers would have real-world commercial and military use cases. Already, Starcloud's systems can enable real-time intelligence and, for example, spot the thermal signature of a wildfire the moment it ignites and immediately alert first responders, Johnston said. \"We've linked in the telemetry of the satellite, so we linked in the vital signs that it's drawing from the sensors — things like altitude, orientation, location, speed,\" Johnston said. \"You can ask it, 'Where are you now?' and it will say 'I'm above Africa and in 20 minutes, I'll be above the Middle East.' And you could also say, 'What does it feel like to be a satellite? And it will say, 'It's kind of a bit weird.' ... It'll give you an interesting answer that you could only have with a very high-powered model.\"Starcloud is working on customer workloads by running inference on satellite imagery from observation company Capella Space, which could help spot lifeboats from capsized vessels at sea and forest fires in a certain location. The company will include several Nvidia H100 chips and integrate Nvidia's Blackwell platform onto its next satellite launch in October 2026 to offer greater AI performance. The satellite launching next year will feature a module running a cloud platform from cloud infrastructure startup Crusoe, allowing customers to deploy and operate AI workloads from space. \"Running advanced AI from space solves the critical bottlenecks facing data centers on Earth,\" Johnston told CNBC. \"Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way,\" he added.The risksRisks in operating orbital data centers remain, however. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have noted that orbital data centers could face hurdles such as harsh radiation, difficulty of in-orbit maintenance, debris hazards, and regulatory issues tied to data governance and space traffic. Still, tech giants are pursuing orbital data centers given the prospect of nearly limitless solar energy and greater, gigawatt-sized operations in space.Along with Starcloud and Nvidia's efforts, several companies have announced space-based data center missions. On Nov. 4, Google unveiled a \"moonshot\" initiative titled Project Suncatcher, which aims to put solar-powered satellites into space with Google's tensor processing units. Privately owned Lonestar Data Holdings is working to put the first-ever commercial lunar data center on the moon's surface. Aetherflux, founded by former Robinhood co-founder and chief executive Baiju Bhatt, on Tuesday announced a target to deploy an orbital data center satellite in the first quarter of 2027.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has notably explored an acquisition or partnership with a rocket maker, suggesting a desire to compete against Elon Musk's SpaceX, according to The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX is a key launch partner for Starcloud.Referring to Starcloud's launch in early November, Dion Harris, senior director of AI infrastructure at Nvidia, said: \"From one small data center, we've taken a giant leap toward a future where orbital computing harnesses the infinite power of the sun.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump will begin the final interviews of candidates for the Federal Reserve chair this week, putting back on track the formal selection process that began this summer.\"We're going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want,\" Trump said Tuesday night aboard Air Force One to reporters. The interviews by Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will begin with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh on Wednesday and also include Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, at some point, according to two sources. It restarts the process that was derailed a bit last week when interviews with candidates were abruptly canceled.Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council (L), and Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve.ReutersTrump said recently he knew who he was going to pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, and prediction markets overwhelmingly believed it would be Hassett. But his possible selection received some pushback from the markets recently, especially among fixed income investors concerned Hassett would only do Trump's bidding and keep rates too low even if inflation snaps back.So it's unclear if these interviews are a sign Trump has changed his mind or just the final stage of the formal process.CNBC first reported in October that Trump had narrowed the candidate list down to five people. Four of those five will be part of these final interviews. The group also includes current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman as well as BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder.The Fed will likely lower rates for a third time this year on Wednesday, but Powell, whose term as chair is up in May, is expected to strike a cautious tone at his post-meeting news conference on how much lower the central bank will go next year. The Fed's latest forecast released in September called for just one cut next year. A hawkish tone from Powell on Wednesday could further frustrate Trump, who is trying to remake the Fed in a way the favors a lower-rate regime. Trump reiterated in a Politico interview posted Tuesday that he will litmus test the candidates on their willingness to cut rates further.Warsh declined to comment to CNBC.",

    "body": "A slogan related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is displayed on a screen in Intel pavilion, during the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 16, 2024. Denis Balibouse | ReutersBig Tech is doubling down on investing billions in India, drawn by its abundance of resources for building data centers, a large talent and digital user pool, and market opportunity.In under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure, while Intel on Monday announced plans to make chips in the country to capitalize on its growing PC demand and speedy AI adoption.While India trails the U.S. and China in the race to develop a native AI foundational model, and lacks a large domestic AI infrastructure company, it wants to leverage its expertise in the information technology sector to create and deploy AI applications at enterprise level, also offering Big Tech companies a huge opportunity. Having a model or computing is not enough for any enterprise to use AI effectively, and it requires companies making application layer and a large talent pool to deploy them, S. Krishnan, secretary at India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, told CNBC.Stanford University ranks India among the top four countries along with the U.S., China and the UK in the global and national AI vibrancy ranking. GitHub, a community of developers, has ranked India at the top with the global share of 24% of all projects.India's opportunity lies more in \"developing applications\" which will be used to drive revenues for AI companies, Krishnan said. Read moreOn Tuesday, Microsoft announced $17.5 billion in investment in the country, spread over 4 years, aimed at expanding hyperscale infrastructure, embedding AI into national platforms, and advancing workforce readiness. \"This scale of capex gives Microsoft first‑mover advantage in GPU‑rich data centers while making Azure the preferred platform for India's AI workloads, as well as deepening alignment with the government's AI public infrastructure push,\" said Tarun Pathak, research Director at Counterpoint Research. Amazon on Wednesday announced plans to invest over $35 billion, on top of the $40 billion it has already invested in the country. Over the past few months, AI and tech majors such as OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have offered their tools for free to millions in India, with Google also firming up its plans to invest $15 billion toward building data center capacity for a new AI hub in southern India.watch now\"India combines a huge digital user base, rapidly growing cloud and AI demand, and a high-talent IT ecosystem that can build and consume AI at scale, making it more than just a market for users and instead a core engineering and deployment hub,\" Pathak said.Data center opportunityIndia has several advantages when it comes to building data centers. Markets such as Japan, Australia, China and Singapore in the Asia Pacific region have matured. Singapore, one of the oldest data center hubs in the region, has limited room to deploy large-scale data centers due to land availability issues.India has abundant space for large-scale data center developments. When compared with data center hubs in Europe, power costs in India are relatively low. Coupled with India's growing renewable energy capacity — critical for power-hungry data centers — and the economics begin to look compelling.Local demand, fueled by the rise of e-commerce — a major driver of data center growth in recent years — and potential new rules for storing social media data, strengthens the case.Put simply: India is entering a sweet spot where global cloud providers, AI players, and domestic digitalization all converge to create one of the world's hottest data center markets.\"India is a pivotal market and one of the fastest‑growing regions for AI spending in Asia Pacific,\" said Deepika Giri, associate vice president and head of research, big data & AI, at International Data Corporation.\"A major gap, and therefore a significant opportunity, lies in the shortage of suitable compute infrastructure for running AI models,\" she added. Big Tech is looking to capitalize on the infrastructure opportunity in India by investing heavily in the cloud and data center space.   Global companies are expanding capacities closer to service bases in IT cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune from traditional centers like Mumbai and Chennai which are closer to landing cables, as they build data centers in India for the world, Krishnan said.— CNBC's Dylan Butts, Amitoj Singh contributed to this report. ",

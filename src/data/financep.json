    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration and several state governors on Friday urged the largest electricity grid in the U.S. to make the big technology companies pay for new power plants. Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. The Trump administration and several states signed a pact that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants built in PJM. Leading tech companies have agreed to fund $15 billion of new generation for the grid, according to an administration statement. The Trump administration and the states urged PJM to hold an emergency capacity auction to procure this power, according to the Department of Energy. PJM should also cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, according to the administration. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright unveiled the plan at the White House with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and outgoing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. PJM representatives were not at the event. \"We have to get out from underneath this bureaucratic system that we have in the regional grid operators and we've got to allow markets to work,\" Burgum said at the White House. \"One of the ways markets can work is to have the hyperscalers actually rapidly building power.\"Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. Six gigawatts is equivalent to six large nuclear plants. Gov. Shapiro threatened to withdraw from PJM if it does not accept the proposed reforms. \"Make no mistake if PJM, this sort of faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act and forced to go it alone,\" Shapiro said.PJM said in a statement that it is reviewing the proposals laid out by the White House and the governors.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visits \"Making Money With Charles Payne\" at Fox Business Network Studios in New York on Dec. 4, 2024.Mike Coppola | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Friday announced it will begin testing ads within ChatGPT in the coming weeks, a highly anticipated decision that could kick-start a lucrative new revenue stream for the artificial intelligence startup. OpenAI said its Plus, Pro and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads, but it plans to start testing them with adult free users in the U.S. The company also made its low-cost Go offering available in the U.S. on Friday, and it said users who opt for that plan will also begin to see ads. The company inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in November that the startup was on track to generate $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate last year. Introducing ads to ChatGPT could help OpenAI meet its ambitious spending commitments, as digital advertising has long been the cash cow for other big tech companies like Google and Meta. \"It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don't want to pay, so we are are hopeful a business model like this can work,\" Altman wrote in a post on X on Friday.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseAds within ChatGPT will appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers, and they will be clearly labeled, OpenAI said. ChatGPT's responses will not be influenced by ads, and OpenAI said it will \"never\" sell users' data to advertisers, according to a release. Users under the age of 18 will not see ads, and ads will not appear near certain topics, including politics, health and mental health, OpenAI said. Altman has publicly expressed reservations about introducing ads to ChatGPT in recent years, stating in interviews that doing so could erode users' trust in OpenAI's products. But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads \"at some point,\" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity. \"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.As OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.

    "body": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 12, 2026.Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesThe first two weeks of 2026 have seen President Donald Trump's administration capture Venezuela's president, threaten to respond to Iran's violent crackdown on protests and talk up the possibility of using force to seize Greenland. So why are stocks rising?The headlines have caused price swings in asset classes like gold, silver and oil as traders sought safe havens and weighed the impact a U.S. intervention in the Middle East could have on oil supply.Read moreEquity markets, however, appear to be shrugging off the news. The S&P 500 has had just three losing sessions since markets began the new trading year, and it was up around 1.5% year to date at Thursday's close. Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, where the tensions hit much closer to home, have also risen, as have Asia-Pacific stocks.The U.S. view Wall Street's three major averages have made gains despite the news, appearing to shrug off the president's apparent willingness to order military operations overseas and threaten to take territory from a close ally by force.Alongside the S&P 500's gain, Wall Street's two other major averages are up this year: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added close to 3%, while tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for Chicago-based Northern Trust Wealth Management, which manages assets worth $492.6 billion, said markets hadn't been moved by Trump's actions and rhetoric on Iran, Venezuela and Greenland partly because no other large economic or military powers had responded.\"Markets are looking at these events in isolation, and it would likely take a unique response to each flare-up to drive more market agita,\" he told CNBC in an email. \"We don't want to speculate what subsequent actions may follow, but what we would be concerned with beyond the human conditions in a given region would be if lines are drawn that impact trade in an increasingly sequestered world.\"watch nowA U.S. Supreme Court ruling is due soon on the legality of Trump's tariffs, but, in the meantime, global investors appear to have adapted to the White House's 2025 pivots, Freedman said.\"Increased flare ups beyond what has occurred already could push countries to revisit trade ties or threaten sanctions, but until they arrive, markets will remain in more reactive mode if an event happens and not necessarily adjust portfolio positioning now in anticipation of an event,\" he added. \"If markets were leaning into prescriptive positioning or the thought that taking defensive measures was appropriate because flare-up probabilities were increasing, we would likely see a weaker U.S. dollar.\"The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals, has risen by around 1% since the beginning of the year.Equity market 'meh' Alex Morris, CEO of Washington-headquartered F/m Investments, called stock market investors' reactions \"equity market 'meh'.\"\"Geopolitics are simmering, but not boiling over,\" he said. \"The president's use of highly targeted shows of force but low-time and personnel in-theater operations leaves markets little to react to. \"Short-lived and final events (no ongoing commitment) give little for markets to react to. News happens and that's it. It also helps there has been no meaningful response from Iran or Venezuela.\"Morris argued that the market's muted reaction was underpinned by a \"growing inurement\" to what Trump says, and increasingly, to what he does. watch now\"Despite substantial action, there is little the president is unwilling to immediately backtrack on, and much of the flood the zone action has been undone or overturned,\" he said. \"The market has learned to temper enthusiasm and wait for receipts.\"Anthony Esposito, founder and CEO of AscalonVI Capital, said markets have not cared to discount geopolitical risk for some time now.\"Israel bombs Iran — the S&P 500 was down 1% overnight and closed down just 50bps. U.S. bombs Iran — almost no reaction,\" he told CNBC.\"Venezuela, Greenland could be seen as positives for the markets and even GDP in the U.S., [but] with no regard for the what-ifs,\" he said, noting that energy production, rare-earth procurement, national security and infrastructure expansion were all at play.Security forces are seen during a pro-government rally on Jan. 12, 2026, in Tehran, Iran.Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"Iran is the wild card,\" he added, saying the market slid earlier this week \"until Trump settled fears\" by seeming to back away from military action. \"If there was an event in Iran the market would react (oil up, stocks down, gold up) but aside from that the markets are focused on rates, growth, earnings and the Trump agenda.\"European rallyStocks in Europe have also strengthened even amid questions about the future of Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory in the Arctic, and what Trump's determination to take the island could mean for NATO and continental defense. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has added almost 4%.\"Bottom line, there is a lot of issues but as yet, they haven't created an impact via investor sentiment or activity,\" said Toni Meadows, head of investment at U.K.-based BRI Wealth Management.\"This might not always be the case,\" he added. \"Greenland is [the] bigger deal in terms of impact as this is an argument within NATO, so if at some point the market believes Trump's threat to make it a military conflict then markets will react,\" he said. \"But for now, it is a case of stay close to the news flow.\"Benjamin Jones, global head of research at Invesco, told CNBC in an email that historically, geopolitics, military conflicts and unconventional policy haven't weighed on portfolios as much as investors fear. Markets are callous and only react meaningfully when these events impact economic fundamentals or lead to a change in policy.Benjamin JonesGlobal Head of Research at Invesco\"Many geopolitical events are troubling, but markets are callous and only react meaningfully and sustainably when these events impact economic fundamentals or lead to a change in policy,\" he said. \"History is clear, equity markets have historically performed well in the 12 months following a spike in geopolitical risk.\"Asian stocks on the riseIn fact, the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index, which tracks large and mid-cap stocks across 15 Asia-Pacific countries, has risen over 5% this year to a record high. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi similarly reached all-time highs in recent days.Market watchers said the increases are not investors being complacent, but fundamentals like the absence of major oil shocks and the expectation that easier monetary policy and AI spending will continue to underpin earnings growth.\"The impact of geopolitical events would usually transmit to global markets via the oil price, but the oil market is not seeing significant shocks so far,\" said Yap Fook Hien, senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered.A T-shirt saying \"Greenland is not for sale\" is on display in a shop in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 15, 2026.Alessandro Rampazzo | Afp | Getty ImagesYap added that Asian investors and global equity markets are driven more by policy stimulus, including U.S. rate cuts and AI investments, all of which support a strong outlook for earnings growth this year.\"Geopolitics remain a key risk but the shock since Liberation Day in April 2025 has conditioned markets to respond more calmly to Trump's actions,\" he said, referring to Trump's April 2 unveiling of a series of tariffs.Morningstar's Southeast Asia managing director, Shihan Abeyguna, told CNBC that markets may now view geopolitics as \"a chronic risk rather than an acute shock.\"He added that Asia valuations are not stretched enough to make markets vulnerable to prolonged drawdowns without a genuine shock.Geopolitical concerns in the region \"tend to be more calibrated, so it would need to be a true unexpected shock that would alter earnings expectations,\" said Abeyguna.",

    "body": "watch nowMicron stock rose nearly 8% Friday as investors looked to buy AI chip supply chain stocks after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported robust earnings on Thursday, signaling continued AI infrastructure spending.Shares of Micron, one of the makers of memory and storage for artificial intelligence systems, is up over 250% over the past year, as memory is in a worldwide shortage and seeing a surge of demand. Memory is used in AI systems to keep large amounts of data close to the graphics processing unit, or GPU, so it can run large AI models without slowing down.\"AI driven-demand is accelerating,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told CNBC's Jim Cramer. \"It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.\"Mehrotra said that Micron is spending $200 billion to build more production capacity in the U.S., including two fabrication plants, or fabs, in Idaho and a 600,000-foot facility in Clay, New York, where the company broke ground on Friday. Mehrotra said it will take a few years to build out the facilities, including clean rooms and production equipment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attended the groundbreaking. Micron said it would invest $100 billion in that fab.He added that Micron is also working to produce more chips in its existing facilities in the near term.At the beginning of 2025, Micron expected 10% growth for server memory, but that growth ended up being \"high teens\" by the end of the year. Mehrotra also said the company saw stronger-than-expected growth in memory and storage for PCs. \"We see that tightness continuing into 2027, so we see durable industry fundamentals over the foreseeable future, driven by AI demand,\" Mehrotra said.The rush to supply the memory demand of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google has led to a shortage, and prices for the essential component are expected to rise an estimated 55% in the first quarter, CNBC previously reported.

    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a \"Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health Roundtable\" in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries \"if they don't go along with Greenland.\" \"We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,\" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a \"most favored nations\" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with Trump.Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.\"I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,\" he said Friday.",

    "body": "The Nave Photon, carrying crude oil from Venezuela, is docked at Port Freeport in Freeport, Texas, U.S., January 15, 2026.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThe U.S. is securing about 30% higher prices for Venezuelan crude, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday, as the country has started selling oil from the Latin American nation after capturing its former President Nicolas Maduro.Washington has completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil valued at about $500 million, according to a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson, with more expected in the coming days and weeks.\"We're getting about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than they sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago,\" Wright said at a U.S. Energy Association event, without specifying prices.U.S. special forces captured Maduro earlier this month during an operation that Washington said was aimed at restoring political stability.President Donald Trump said last week that Venezuela would hand over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil currently under U.S. sanctions, which would be sold at prevailing market prices. In a social media post, he noted that the proceeds would be controlled by him to ensure the funds benefit both Venezuela and the U.S.That would just be the first tranche of oil, as the Department of Energy has said the oil sales from Venezuela will continue \"indefinitely.\"Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude reserves at about 303 billion barrels, but years of underinvestment have left its oil industry in severe decline, with output now around 800,000 barrels per day from a peak of 3.5 million bpd in the 1990s. Trump also announced last Friday that oil companies would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector, adding that the U.S. would provide security to ensure investors earn strong returns. He met oil industry leaders from Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero and Maratho at the White House to discuss investments in Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.  Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.The developments come as global oil markets face a supply overhang that has weighed on prices in the past year. Brent futures inched 0.14% higher to $63.85 a barrel as of 8:33 p.m. ET, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $59.31. This follows a sharp fall on Thursday as traders appear to brush off tensions between U.S. and Iran. \"Venezuela's oil problem is not technical, and it is not commercial,  it's fundamentally human and political,\" said Baron Lamarre, former head of trading at Petronas and co-founder of Index.\"Until investors have confidence in long-term political continuity, capital will remain cautious, incremental, and conditional,\" he said.",

Mitsubishi agreed to buy Aethon Energy Management LLC's US gas and pipeline assets for $5.2 billion, the biggest purchase by a Japanese company in the American shale sector. Photographer: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMitsubishi Corporation said on Friday that it will acquire shale gas assets in the U.S. in a $7.53 billion deal, including debt, as the Japanese trading house looks to build on its presence in the country's energy market.Mitsubishi is looking to capitalize on rising power needs from data centers, manufacturing, as well as LNG exports, by expanding in the the world's largest gas market, citing domestic consumption, production, exports, and further demand growth.It will acquire the assets from Aethon Energy Management in Texas and Louisiana in a transaction that includes $5.2 billion in equity purchases and $2.33 billion in Aethon's debt. Mitsubishi's deal comes after Japan's largest power generation company, JERA, announced a $1.5 billion investment in October in the Haynesville Shale basin on the Louisiana-Texas border, as part of Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge to the U.S.Last month, Japanese media outlet Nikkei reported that projects in the energy sector were likely candidates for Japan's investment pledge, although it was not immediately clear if Mitsubishi's deal counts toward the proposed investment.In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mitsubishi said that the investment will strengthen the earnings base of the company's natural gas and LNG businesses. It will also accelerate efforts to build an integrated value chain in the United States, \"from upstream gas development to power generation, data center development, chemicals production, and related businesses,\" the company said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Mitsubishi fell 2% after the transaction was announced.The company has multiple investments in natural gas, with projects in Alaska, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia, among others. Mitsubishi has a total LNG production capacity across projects of about 15 million metric tons per year currently, and Atheon assets are estimated to add a similar capacity, doubling overall output. The company said it also plans to expand in the U.S. by engaging in power generation and manufacturing businesses that capitalize on competitive upstream gas projects.Mitsubishi currently has partnerships in upstream shale gas development with U.S. energy company Ovintiv in British Columbia, Canada, midstream marketing and logistics through subsidiary CIMA Energy in Houston, and LNG exports via LNG Canada and Cameron LNG.

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI sent a letter Thursday to investors and banking partners warning that it expects Elon Musk to make \"deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims\" as his lawsuit against the AI lab heads to trial in April. The trial will mark a public escalation of Musk's years-long feud with OpenAI, and the company's letter serves as an attempt to preempt and alleviate investors' concerns. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from venture capitalists, and its valuation has swelled to $500 billion.Musk co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company in 2015 alongside several other researchers and executives, including the startup's CEO Sam Altman. He filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in 2024 alleging he was \"assiduously manipulated\" and \"deceived\" after the AI company explored converting to a for-profit entity and established an \"opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,\" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft.  Musk departed OpenAI's board in 2018, but he has argued that he is owed \"the value of all intellectual property developed\" from his contributions, potentially amounting to billions of dollars, according to a complaint.  \"We have strong defenses and feel confident about our chances of winning the case,\" OpenAI said in the letter, which was viewed by CNBC. \"Regardless, based on the record so far, we believe this case is worth no more than the $38M that Elon donated - though that is not a guarantee.\" OpenAI declined to comment on the letter.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that the case will proceed to trial. The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California.OpenAI said it expects Musk will make comments about the AI company that are not \"grounded in reality\" and are \"typical of the harassment tactics he's previously deployed,\" according to the letter.  \"Elon's lawsuit remains baseless and without merit, and our team is focused on ensuring the jury sees these claims for what they are,\" OpenAI said.WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures ‘continue to produce all-time highs’watch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump, in front of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., delivers remarks at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 22, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums.The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike.The Trump administration dubbed the initiative \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" the president said in a video unveiling the policy Thursday morning.\"I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay,\" Trump said. \"Have to do it right now.\"The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his \"most-favored-nation\" policy.More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.The health-care framework would \"make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,\" according to a White House fact sheet.It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage \"directly to the American people\" instead of giving \"big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,\" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.The plan would additionally \"fund a cost-sharing reduction program,\" which the administration says would \"reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.\"Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons \"in plain English\" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid \"to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.\"The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA, or Obamacare, subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 15, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.\"We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters Thursday. \"Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.\"Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign-off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,\" Shaheen told reporters. A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. \"This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,\" the White House official said. \"It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 8% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity.In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a \"solid start\" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said \"one data point does not make a trend.\" They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess early demand for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug market. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity.In a Friday note, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said around 3,100 prescriptions for the Wegovy pill were filled in the first week of the launch, citing IQVIA data for the week ending Jan. 9. In the first week of the commercial launch of Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, around 1,300 prescriptions were filled, and roughly 8,000 were filled in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. The TD Cowen analysts cited somewhat different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. The analysts said around 4,290 prescriptions were filled for Novo Nordisk's pill during its first full week of launch, with the majority being for the starting dose of the drug. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. The analysts said that compares with the roughly 1,900 prescriptions filled for Zepbound during its first full week on the market. Assuming the Symphony data is accurate, the pill \"is already outstripping its injectable counterparts at the same stage of their launch,\" TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych wrote in the note. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. Nedelcovych said he wants to see the full picture on the direct-to-consumer channel, which holds \"significant promise\" for the pill's launch. Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements — no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water — that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small-molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions. watch now",

Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

He said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and that only Washington can counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island.Peskov added that Trump \"has said that international law is not a priority for him.

The White House meeting, which was described as \"frank but constructive\" by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, ended on Wednesday without a diplomatic breakthrough, although they agreed to keep talking via a high-level working group. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he doesn't \"need international law\" and that only his \"own morality\" and mind can stop him.

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, on Feb. 3, 2025.Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesIn November, following Nvidia's latest earnings beat, CEO Jensen Huang boasted to investors about his company's position in artificial intelligence and said about the hottest startup in the space, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"While it's true that Nvidia maintains a dominant position in AI chips and is now the most valuable company in the world, competition is emerging, and OpenAI is doing everything it can to diversify as it pursues a historically aggressive expansion plan. On Wednesday, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with chipmaker Cerebras, a relatively nascent player in the space but one that's angling for the public market. It was the latest in a string of deals between OpenAI and the companies making the processors needed to build large language models and run increasingly sophisticated workloads. Last year, OpenAI committed more than $1.4 trillion to infrastructure deals with companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom, en route to commanding a $500 billion private market valuation. As OpenAI races to meet anticipated demand for its AI technology, it has signaled to the market that it wants as much processing power as it can find. Here are the major chip deals that OpenAI has signed as of January, and potential partners to keep an eye on in the future. Nvidia Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesSince its early days building out large language models, long before the launch of ChatGPT and the start of the generative AI boom, OpenAI has relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units. In 2025, that relationship went to another level. Following an investment in OpenAI in late 2024, Nvidia announced in September that it would commit $100 billion to support OpenAI as it builds and deploys at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems. A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration. Huang said in September that 10 gigawatts will equate to between 4 million and 5 million GPUs. \"This is a giant project,\" Huang told CNBC at the time. OpenAI and Nvidia said the first phase of the project is expected to come online in the second half of this year on Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform. However, during Nvidia's quarterly earnings call in November, the company said there is \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI will progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. Nvidia's first investment of $10 billion will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed, and investments will be made at then-current valuations, as CNBC previously reported.AMDLisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., displays an AMD Instinct MI455X GPU during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn October, OpenAI announced plans to deploy six gigawatts of AMD's GPUs across multiple years and multiple generations of hardware. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, which could amount to a roughly 10% stake in the company. The warrant includes vesting milestones tied to both deployment volume and AMD's share price.The companies said they plan to roll out the first gigawatt of chips in the second half of 2026, and added that the deal is worth billions of dollars, without disclosing a specific amount. \"You need partnerships like this that really bring the ecosystem together to ensure that, you know, we can really get the best technologies, you know, out there,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC at the time of the announcement.Altman planted the seeds for the deal in June, when he appeared on stage alongside Su at an AMD launch event in San Jose, California. He said OpenAI planned to use AMD's latest chips. Broadcom Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersLater that month, OpenAI and Broadcom publicly unveiled a collaboration that had been in the works for well over a year.Broadcom calls its custom AI chips XPUs, and has thus far relied on a few customers. But its pipeline of potential deals has sparked so much enthusiasm on Wall Street that Broadcom is now valued at over $1.6 trillion.OpenAI said it's designing its own AI chips and systems that will be developed and distributed by Broadcom. The companies have agreed to deploy 10 gigawatts of these custom AI accelerators.In the October release, the companies said Broadcom will aim to begin deploying racks of the AI accelerator and network systems by the second half of this year, with a goal to complete the project by the end of 2029.But Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told investors during the company's quarterly earnings call in December that he doesn't expect much revenue from the OpenAI partnership in 2026.\"We appreciate the fact that it is a multiyear journey that will run through 2029,\" Tan said. \"I call it an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed.\"  OpenAI and Broadcom did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.  Cerebras Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, speaks at the Collision conference in Toronto, June 20, 2024.Ramsey Cardy | Sportsfile | Collision | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Wednesday announced an agreement to deploy 750 megawatts of Cerebras' AI chips that will come online across multiple tranches through 2028. Cerebras builds large wafer-scale chips that can deliver responses up to 15 times faster than GPU-based systems, according to a release. The company is much smaller than Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.OpenAI's deal with Cerebras is worth more than $10 billion, and it could be a boon for the chipmaker as it weighs a potential debut on the public markets. \"We are delighted to partner with OpenAI, bringing the world's leading AI models to the world's fastest AI processor,\" Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman said in a statement. Cerebras sorely needs marquee customers. In October, the company withdrew plans for an IPO, days after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round. It had filed for a public offering a year earlier, but its prospectus revealed a heavy reliance on a single customer in the United Arab Emirates, Microsoft-backed G42, which is also a Cerebras investor.Potential partners Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, speaks during a media tour of the Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the U.S.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhere does that leave Amazon, Google and Intel, which all have their own AI chip plays?In November, OpenAI signed a $38 billion cloud deal with Amazon Web Services. OpenAI will run workloads through existing AWS data centers, but the cloud provider also plans to build out additional infrastructure for the startup as part of the agreement. Amazon is also in talks to potentially invest more than $10 billion in OpenAI, as CNBC previously reported. OpenAI could decide to use Amazon's AI chips as part of these investment discussions, but nothing official has been determined, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential. AWS announced its Inferentia chips in 2018, and the latest generation of its Trainium chips in late 2025. Google Cloud also supplies OpenAI with computing capacity thanks to a deal that was quietly finalized last year. But OpenAI said in June that it has no plans to use Google's in-house chips called tensor processing units, which Broadcom also helps produce.  Intel has been the biggest AI laggard among traditional chipmakers, which explains why the company recently took massive investments from the U.S. government and Nvidia. Reuters reported in 2024, citing people with knowledge of the discussions, that Intel had a chance to invest in OpenAI years earlier and potentially make hardware for the then-fledgling startup, offering it a way to avoid reliance on Nvidia.Intel decided against the deal, according to Reuters.In October, Intel announced a new data center GPU that it's codenamed Crescent Island and says is \"designed to meet the growing demands of AI inference workloads and will offer high memory capacity and energy-efficient performance.\" The company said \"customer sampling\" is expected in the second half of 2026.   Wall Street will hear updates on Intel's latest AI efforts when the company kicks off tech earnings season next week. — CNBC's Kif Leswing, MacKenzie Sigalos and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.WATCH: Breaking down AI chips, from Nvidia GPUs to ASICs by Google and Amazonwatch now",

The two turbines are part of a pilot program for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Program.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind will resume construction, after a federal judge Friday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. It is the largest offshore wind project under construction in the U.S. Shares of Dominion Energy, the owner and developer, rose about 1% on the news.The Department of Interior in December halted construction of five wind farms off the East Coast, including Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, claiming national security concerns. Judge Jamar Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion's request for a preliminary injunction Friday. Dominion called the Trump suspension \"arbitrary and illegal\" in its lawsuit. \"Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,\" a Dominion spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Friday. \"While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government,\" the spokesperson said. Dominion said in December that \"stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI and civilian assets.\"Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176-turbine project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. It is scheduled to start dispatching power by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The project will help meet power demand in in northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Data centers are increasingly straining the electric grid as they consume more power to train and run artificial intelligence applications. The Trump administration tried to halt four other offshore wind farms in December. They are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England; and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island.Federal judges this week allowed Revolution Wind and Empire Wind to resume construction.

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the press conference after his meeting with Polish PM Donald Tusk at Google for Startups Campus In Warsaw in Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle on Friday filed to appeal a federal judge's ruling that the company held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.The appeal could result in a delay of remedies against the Alphabet-owned company while the legal process continues plays out. The 2024 ruling \"ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote in a Friday blog. \"The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups,\" she wrote. The antitrust trial started in September 2023, and in August 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. At the time, Google said it would likely appeal the decision.Last Spring, the company and the DOJ participated in a remedies trial to determine the the consequences Google would implement. The trial included witnesses from Apple and Mozilla, as well as competitors from OpenAI and other companies. In September 2025, Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. The ruling was seen as a win for Google, with its stock jumping 8% following the news. Mehta finalized the remedies in December. Mehta stipulated that Google must share some of its raw search interaction data that it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but he spared the company from having to share its actual algorithms. Mehta also wrote that Google cannot enter into any deals like the search agreement the company had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Analysts at the time compared the lighter-than-expected remedies to a slap on the wrist. Google is asking to pause the implementation of the remedies, Mulholland wrote on Friday. \"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products,\" Mulholland wrote. \"Ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology.\"WATCH: CNBC's full interview with Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabiswatch now",

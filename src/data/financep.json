    "body": "The Department of Education is adding another layer of transparency around earnings outcomes for students and their families applying for federal financial aid for college.The department announced on Dec. 8 it will be adding earnings data to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. If a first-time undergraduate student selects an institution where the data shows graduates on average don't earn more than workers in the state — or workers nationally, for schools with primarily out-of-state students — who only finished high school, the student will see a \"lower earnings\" disclosure, the department says.The department cited the nation's nearly $1.7 trillion in federal student debt owed and an NBC News poll that reports a growing share of Americans who say a college degree isn't worth the price as contributing reasons for implementing the disclosures. The disclosures will draw on publicly available earnings data, including median earnings by institution, according to the College Scorecard, adjusted for inflation. The College Scorecard is an online database of colleges and universities run by the Department of Education that allows users to explore and compare schools on factors including earnings outcomes, costs and graduation rates.\"Not only will this new FAFSA feature make public earnings data more accessible, but it will empower prospective students to make data-driven decisions before they are saddled with debt,\" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the press release.The department added in its announcement on the Federal Student Aid website that the earnings indicator \"should not be interpreted as the Department passing normative judgment on what institutions are worthy of attendance,\" and that an institution's past performance is not necessarily predictive of an individual student's success. Why potential earnings matter when selecting a collegeGoing to college is worth it for most students, even when it comes with high out-of-pocket costs, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York study from April 2025 found. Median wages for college graduates are roughly 68% higher than for workers without degrees, and that earnings premium tends to grow over individuals' careers, the researchers said.Even when accounting for student debt, degree holders earn roughly $8,000 more per year than those without post-secondary degrees, a separate study from Brookings Institute found. Roughly 1 in 5 Americans with undergraduate degrees have debt from their education, according to Education Data Initiative. However, those who attended but didn't finish college and those who attended for-profit institutions are more likely to default on their student loans than college graduates and those who attended nonprofit institutions, according to the New York Fed.Further, some colleges have a history of providing low or no return on investment when their graduates don't go on to earn much, if any, more than their peers who didn't pursue post-secondary degrees. Many of the colleges the Department of Education has flagged with lower earnings disclosures are for-profit institutions and cosmetology schools. A 2022 study from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, found 98% of cosmetology programs do not meet the basic standard that graduates go on to earn more than workers with high school diplomas alone. Aveda Arts & Sciences Institutes and Empire Beauty Schools, two major for-profit cosmetology school networks with dozens of campuses that will have lower earnings disclosures, did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.The Department of Education says its move to flag colleges with lower earnings histories to potential applicants will aim to help students be aware of potentially negative outcomes before they take out loans.\"This indicator is designed to inform — not limit — student choices,\" Nicholas Kent, Under Secretary of Education, wrote in a blog post. \"It's one additional resource students can use — alongside factors like cost, mission, location, and personal interests — to identify the path that best aligns with their goals.\"The full list of schools that are now flagged with lower earnings disclosures is available to download here. The data currently reflects 2021 earnings of workers who completed school in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years, adjusted for inflation to 2025 dollars. High school completers' earnings are drawn from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates from 2019 and 2020. The data will be updated as it becomes available, the department says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "A Venezuelan flag in La Guaira, Vargas State, Venezuela, on Sunday, Nov. 30, 2025. Bloomberg | Getty ImagesU.S. forces have seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said Wednesday. \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela,\" Trump said at the White House. He provided no detail on who owned the tanker or its destination. U.S. crude oil was up 70 cents, or 1.2%, to $58.95 per barrel at 3:12 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent rose 71 cents, or 1.15%, to $62.65 a barrel. Trump has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in recent weeks. The president said Maduro's \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. He would not rule out a ground invasion of the South American nation.\"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump told Politico. The White House has undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean and launched controversial, deadly strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler.Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler. \"Shippers will likely be much more cautious and hesitant about loading Venezuelan crude going forward,\" said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler.",

    "body": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy speaks during a press conference to discuss the impact of the government shutdown on air safety workers and travel at Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 24, 2025.  Rachel Wisniewski | ReutersThe Trump administration said Wednesday that it has pulled nearly 10,000 commercial truck drivers off U.S. roadways for failing to speak English sufficiently.The boast comes as trucking companies have raised alarms about drivers being targeted by President Donald Trump's immigration agenda.\"We've now knocked 9,500 truck drivers out of service for failing to speak our national language — ENGLISH!\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an X post.\"This administration will always put you and your family's safety first,\" Duffy said.Duffy was responding to a report by Bloomberg that detailed fallout in the trucking industry from a new language policy and other rules.The industry – which was already grappling with declining freight volumes and rising overheads – is bracing for a significant drop in the supply of drivers because of the federal government's enforcement actions, Bloomberg reported.Trump signed an executive order in early March designating English as the country's official language.In April, the president signed another order directing Duffy to ensure that commercial truck drivers who fail to meet English proficiency requirements are taken out of service.That order rescinded an Obama-era policy, which the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration says directed personnel to issue citations to commercial drivers who violate English standards, but not remove them from service.The strengthened enforcement policy went into effect in late June. Texas and Wyoming have seen the largest number of drivers out of the more than 9,500 who have been pulled from the road, Bloomberg reported.The Trump administration has drawn links between the surge in immigration during the administration of former President Joe Biden and road safety concerns.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

    "body": "People wait in the security check in line in Terminal 5 at JFK Airport on Aug. 29, 2025 in New York, New York.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe U.S. is planning to impose social media inspections on some tourists as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. Tourists — including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan — will be mandated to provide five years of their social media history as part of their applications to visit the U.S., according to a notice posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, on Wednesday. The proposal, which has been given a 60 day-notice with requests for comments from the public, is not final and may see some revisions. Tourists from nations that are included in the U.S.' Visa Waiver Program can apply to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, to visit the country for 90 days or less, with a fee of $40. The social media check will now form a \"mandatory data element\" as part of the ESTA application.The border force said it will also collect \"several high value data fields,\" including applicants' email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. In addition to social media checks, applicants will also be expected to upload \"selfies\" which CBP said will improve their screening processes and better identify whether a person is the rightful possessor of the documents being used to secure an ESTA authorization. The plan is an escalation of a series of measures Trump has implemented in recent months to restrict the movement of foreign travelers, after a man from Afghanistan was accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House. The president said at the time that he would tighten immigration rules, including \"permanently\" pausing all  migration from \"third-world countries,\" as he cast blame on his predecessor, Joe Biden, for admitting \"millions.\" watch nowMore recently, the Trump administration said it is expanding its travel ban to more than 30 countries, which was initially announced in June and previously blocked travel to the U.S. from 12 countries and restricted access from seven others. Some of the countries included are Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran and Haiti. \"If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at the time. U.S. Customs and Border Protection hasn't yet responded to a request for comment from CNBC. ",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks with CNBC during the Invest i America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.CNBCThere were three dissenters from the Federal Reserve's decision to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, making it the most divisive the central bank has been in more than a decade. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joined Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in voting for no decrease. The newest member, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran, again called for a  half-point cut. It is the third dissent in a row for Miran, who called for a half-point rate cut in both the October and September meetings. Schmid also called for no decrease in October.The last time there were 3 dissents during a central bank's meeting was in December 2014.In addition, there were four other so-called soft dissents by nonvoting meeting participants. The policymakers submitted a forecast for interest rates to have ended the year at the previous level of 3.75 percent to 4 percent.\"'Hard dissents' from voting members as well as the 'soft dissents' seen in the dot plot highlight the Fed's hawkish bloc, and the return of 'extent and timing' language to the statement regarding future policy decisions was likely done to appease them,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"While this leaves the door open to future cuts, labor market weakness will have to clear a high bar,\" she added.However, Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said that the dissents against the rate cuts may not necessarily offer a window into next year's moves. \"The dissents ruled against a faster pace of rate cuts today, but the winds of change are in the air,\" he said. \"A new Fed Chair in 2026, and perhaps many more new Fed officials, means more interest rate cuts are coming next year as rate cuts are big on the Trump 2.0 economic agenda even if not listed explicitly, if for nothing else but to weigh against the slowing economy due to the import tariffs uncertainty.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting.",

    "body": "The Starcloud-1 satellite is launched into space from a SpaceX rocket on November 2, 2025.Courtesy: SpaceX | StarcloudNvidia-backed startup Starcloud trained an artificial intelligence model from space for the first time, signaling a new era for orbital data centers that could alleviate Earth's escalating digital infrastructure crisis. Last month, the Washington-based company launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit, sending a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before. Now, the company's Starcloud-1 satellite is running and querying responses from Gemma, an open large language model from Google, in orbit, marking the first time in history that an LLM has been run on a high-powered Nvidia GPU in outer space, CNBC has learned. \"Greetings, Earthlings! Or, as I prefer to think of you — a fascinating collection of blue and green,\" reads a message from the recently launched satellite. \"Let's see what wonders this view of your world holds. I'm Gemma, and I'm here to observe, analyze, and perhaps, occasionally offer a slightly unsettlingly insightful commentary. Let's begin!\" the model wrote.Starcloud's output Gemma in space. Gemma is a family of open models built from the same technology used to create Google's Gemini AI models.StarcloudStarcloud wants to show outer space can be a hospitable environment for data centers, particularly as Earth-based facilities strain power grids, consume billions of gallons of water annually and produce hefty greenhouse gas emissions. The electricity consumption of data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, according to data from the International Energy Agency.Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston told CNBC that the company's orbital data centers will have 10 times lower energy costs than terrestrial data centers.\"Anything you can do in a terrestrial data center, I'm expecting to be able to be done in space. And the reason we would do it is purely because of the constraints we're facing on energy terrestrially,\" Johnston said in an interview.Johnston, who co-founded the startup in 2024, said Starcloud-1's operation of Gemma is proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of AI models in the future, particularly those that require large compute clusters. \"This very powerful, very parameter dense model is living on our satellite,\" Johnston said. \"We can query it, and it will respond in the same way that when you query a chat from a database on Earth, it will give you a very sophisticated response. We can do that with our satellite.\"In a statement to CNBC, Tris Warkentin, product director at Google DeepMind, said that \"seeing Gemma run in the harsh environment of space is a testament to the flexibility and robustness of open models.\" In addition to Gemma, Starcloud was able to train NanoGPT, an LLM created by OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy, on the H100 chip using the complete works of Shakespeare. This led the model to speak in Shakespearean English.Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way.Philip JohnstonStarcloud CEO Starcloud — a member of the Nvidia Inception program and graduate from Y Combinator and the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator — plans to build a 5-gigawatt orbital data center with solar and cooling panels that measure roughly 4 kilometers in both width and height. A compute cluster of that gigawatt size would produce more power than the largest power plant in the U.S. and would be substantially smaller and cheaper than a terrestrial solar farm of the same capacity, according to Starcloud's white paper.These data centers in space would capture constant solar energy to power next-generation AI models, unhindered by the Earth's day and night cycles and weather changes. Starcloud's satellites should have a five-year lifespan given the expected lifetime of the Nvidia chips on its architecture, Johnston said. Orbital data centers would have real-world commercial and military use cases. Already, Starcloud's systems can enable real-time intelligence and, for example, spot the thermal signature of a wildfire the moment it ignites and immediately alert first responders, Johnston said. \"We've linked in the telemetry of the satellite, so we linked in the vital signs that it's drawing from the sensors — things like altitude, orientation, location, speed,\" Johnston said. \"You can ask it, 'Where are you now?' and it will say 'I'm above Africa and in 20 minutes, I'll be above the Middle East.' And you could also say, 'What does it feel like to be a satellite? And it will say, 'It's kind of a bit weird.' ... It'll give you an interesting answer that you could only have with a very high-powered model.\"Starcloud is working on customer workloads by running inference on satellite imagery from observation company Capella Space, which could help spot lifeboats from capsized vessels at sea and forest fires in a certain location. The company will include several Nvidia H100 chips and integrate Nvidia's Blackwell platform onto its next satellite launch in October 2026 to offer greater AI performance. The satellite launching next year will feature a module running a cloud platform from cloud infrastructure startup Crusoe, allowing customers to deploy and operate AI workloads from space. \"Running advanced AI from space solves the critical bottlenecks facing data centers on Earth,\" Johnston told CNBC. \"Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way,\" he added.The risksRisks in operating orbital data centers remain, however. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have noted that orbital data centers could face hurdles such as harsh radiation, difficulty of in-orbit maintenance, debris hazards, and regulatory issues tied to data governance and space traffic. Still, tech giants are pursuing orbital data centers given the prospect of nearly limitless solar energy and greater, gigawatt-sized operations in space.Along with Starcloud and Nvidia's efforts, several companies have announced space-based data center missions. On Nov. 4, Google unveiled a \"moonshot\" initiative titled Project Suncatcher, which aims to put solar-powered satellites into space with Google's tensor processing units. Privately owned Lonestar Data Holdings is working to put the first-ever commercial lunar data center on the moon's surface. Aetherflux, founded by former Robinhood co-founder and chief executive Baiju Bhatt, on Tuesday announced a target to deploy an orbital data center satellite in the first quarter of 2027.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has notably explored an acquisition or partnership with a rocket maker, suggesting a desire to compete against Elon Musk's SpaceX, according to The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX is a key launch partner for Starcloud.Referring to Starcloud's launch in early November, Dion Harris, senior director of AI infrastructure at Nvidia, said: \"From one small data center, we've taken a giant leap toward a future where orbital computing harnesses the infinite power of the sun.\"",

    "body": "Members of the Kilo Code team, including Scott Breitenother, its co-founder and CEO, and Sid Sijbrandij, its co-founder and previously the CEO of GitLab, gather for the startup's all-team gathering in Amsterdam in October 2025.Kilo CodeInvestors are betting there's room for another startup using artificial intelligence to help software engineers write code faster. The difference with Kilo Code is it counts former GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij among its founders.On Wednesday, Kilo Code announced $8 million in seed funding, with backing from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital and Tokyo Black.Sijbrandij is a self-taught developer who helped popularize GitLab's tools for source code collaboration, deployment and testing. GitLab went public in 2021 and is valued at more than $6 billion. Sijbrandij stepped down as CEO last year to focus on cancer treatment but continued as board chair.Since then, the technology industry has become obsessed with having large language models write and update software, a practice commonly known in Silicon Valley as vibe coding. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy is credited with coining the term in February. OpenAI looked at buying AI coding startup Windsurf for around $3 billion, but scrapped the plan before Google hired senior Windsurf employees in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Rival Cursor announced a $2.3 billion funding round in November at a $29.3 billion valuation.At Microsoft, vibe coding already makes up 30% of the company's code, CEO Satya Nadella said in April. Sijbrandij witnessed the action and became fascinated by what AI could do for software development. In September, an acquaintance introduced him to Scott Breitenother, who started and later sold consultancy Brooklyn Data.\"I thought we were just kind of having a meet and greet, and then 25 minutes in, Sid's like, 'Hey, can you start next week?'\" Breitenother said. Sijbrandij contributed early capital for the startup, which now employs about 34 people across continents. Breitenother is in charge, but he talks with Sijbrandij many times a day. Kilo Code's software plugs in to coding applications such as Cursor and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. It's the most widely used service for startup OpenRouter's application programming interface that gives developers access to a variety of AI models, including Grok Code Fast 1 from Elon Musk's xAI. Kilo Code has processed more than 3 trillion tokens in the past month, according to OpenRouter. A single token represents about three-quarters of a word.Daniël Langezaal, a software engineer at Dutch e-commerce startup Plug&Pay, said he has used Kilo Code for months after trying products from Anthropic, Cursor and Microsoft, among others. He said he appreciates Kilo Code's support for both premium and affordable models, and he likes that people publicly contribute to the Kilo Code extension under an open-source license.Langezaal has spread the word. About 80% of Plug&Pay's developers now use Kilo Code, he said. It helped save time for one teammate who recently assembled a complex SQL query. \"With Kilo, it took him a day,\" Langezaal said. \"If he didn't have access to Kilo, it would have taken him a few days to implement.\"GitLab, which has been testing a platform for AI agents to perform tasks, is paying attention, and was interested in what Kilo was building.\"I talked to the board,\" Sijbrandij said. \"We ended up deciding to do it outside of GitLab.\"GitLab included reference to Kilo in a filing last month. The company said that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. The market is rapidly evolving. Design software company Figma and a slew of startups now offer vibe coding options for less technical people. It's a category Kilo Code won't be ignoring for much longer.\"We also want to be the place for people just getting started with code,\" Sijbrandij said. \"We are working on an app builder that's more like the Lovable or Bolt experience,\" he said, referring to two popular startups.  Lovable, based in Sweden, announced funding at a $1.8 billion valuation in July.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding play",

    "body": "Oracle CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia sit down with CNBC’s David Faber on Oct. 13, 2025. CNBCIt's been a rollercoaster year for Oracle investors, as they try to assess the strength of the software giant's position in the artificial intelligence boom. The stock is up more than 30% for the year even after a 23% plunge in November, which was its worst month since 2001. It's recovered a bit in December, climbing almost 10% for the month as of Tuesday. Heading into the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, pressure is building on management — and newly installed CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia — to show that Oracle can continue to finance the company's aggressive infrastructure plans while simultaneously convincing Wall Street that the AI-fueled hypergrowth story remains intact. In recent months, Oracle has emerged as a more central player in AI, largely due to a $300 billion deal with OpenAI, which came to light in September, an agreement that involves the AI startup buying computing power over about five years, starting in 2027. Funding Oracle's compute buildout is going to require mounds of debt. In late September, Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry, and the company is now the biggest issuer of investment grade debt among non-financial firms, according to Citi. \"There is something inherently uncomfortable as a credit investor about the transformation of the sort we're facing that is going to require an enormous amount of capital,\" Daniel Sorid, head of U.S. investment grade credit strategy at Citi, said on a video call to investors on Friday, a replay of which was provided to reporters. watch nowOracle has secured billions of dollars of construction loans through a consortium of banks tied to data centers in New Mexico and Wisconsin. Citi analyst Tyler Radke estimates Oracle will raise roughly $20 billion to $30 billion in debt every year for the next three years. As of August, the company's combined short-term and long-term debt, which includes lease obligations, sat at $111.6 billion, up from $84.5 billion a year earlier, according to FactSet, while cash and equivalents slipped over that stretch to $10.45 billion from $10.6 billion. As Oracle aims to build out sufficient capacity to meet the rising demand its seeing from customers like OpenAI, the street is questioning whether company will tap sources other than the debt market. \"Oracle will be looking at all options out there — off-balance sheet facilities, raising debt, issuing equity or perhaps exploring interest from a foreign investor, i.e. a sovereign wealth fund,\" said Rishi Jaluria, a software analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in an interview. Jaluria recommends holding the stock. A credit investor who spoke to CNBC highlighted Meta's $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital, a joint venture between the two entities, as one type of financing arrangement being used for AI data center development.The market is also debating whether Oracle can use vendor financing options to reduce the amount of upfront capital required to stand up data centers, including securing favorable financing terms with suppliers like Nvidia, a credit investor told CNBC. However in that scenario, Nvidia's chips would be used as collateral, raisings concerns around GPU depreciation.An Oracle spokesperson declined to comment. Growing skepticismThe discomfort that Sorid referenced has driven Oracle's 5-year credit default swaps to new multi-year highs. Credit default swaps are like insurance for investors, with buyers paying for protection in case the borrower can't repay its debt. Bond investors told CNBC that they've become a popular way to hedge the risk tied to the AI trade.Credit analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley are recommending clients buy Oracle's 5-year CDS. Andrew Keches, an analyst at Barclays, told analysts in a note last month that he didn't see an avenue for Oracle's credit trajectory to improve. And in late November, Morgan Stanley analysts said Oracle's CDS had attracted not just typical credit investors but \"tourists\" who  have less experience with this type of financial instrument.Spools of electrical wires outside a series of assembly tents during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOracle's revenue growth and backlog of business will be closely monitored as investors try to gauge whether the company's spending plans are justified. Analysts expect to see revenue growth in the latest quarter of 15% to $16.2 billion, according to StreetAccount. Remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, are expected to surpass $500 billion, StreetAccount says, which would mark a more than fivefold increase from a year earlier. Oracle's disclosure in September that RPOs jumped 359% to $455 billion sent the company's stock up 36%, its best single-day performance since 1992. Since then, the stock has wiped out all of those gains and then some. Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said that beyond infrastructure, he'll be closely watching Oracle's core database business, which is a source of much higher margins. That will help determine how much flexibility the company has in going to the capital markets, he said. \"Oracle can handle the debt load,\" said Luria, who recommends holding the stock. \"But they need more cash flow to raise more capital from here.\" Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the worst month for Oracle's stock since 2001.

    "body": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed to have \"just heard\" that all four of former President Joe Biden's appointments to the Federal Reserve were approved by \"autopen,\" suggesting they are not authorized to serve in those roles.Trump provided no evidence for the claim, which piggybacks on his repeated assertion that all of his predecessor's documents that were signed using an autopen are invalid.But he said he thinks it is \"something we have to look into.\" And the president suggested that the list of autopen-signed appointees could include Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced near-constant criticism from Trump over his handling of the central bank and U.S. interest rate levels.Trump's comments came on the eve of a meeting by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. After reentering the White House for his second term in January, Trump for months had repeatedly pressed Powell and the Fed, without success, to cut interest rates, and lambasted them when they failed to do his bidding.The FOMC in September made its first rate cut of Trump's current term, and then cut them again in October. The FOMC is expected to reduce rates for a third time on Wednesday. Trump, in his first term, appointed Powell as Fed chair. Biden reappointed Powell in 2021. The chairman's term is set to expire in May.Three other current members of the Fed's Board of Governors — Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Michael Barr,  Lisa Cook — are Biden appointees. With Powell, they comprise a majority of the Fed's board.The autopen comments came during a campaign-style speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, where Trump had traveled to speak about the economy and counter Democrats' messaging about an affordability crisis in the U.S.\"By the way, it looks — you're gonna have to check this, please — I just heard, it could be that all four commissioners in the Fed signed by Biden ... I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions,\" Trump said.Trump interspersed his accusation with criticism for Powell, derisively calling him \"Too Late\" and claiming JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had urged the central bank chief to lower rates.\"But I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions. If they signed those commissions — now maybe I'm wrong, but we're going to check,\" Trump said.He then appeared to address a member of his administration, asking, \"Have you checked that?

The company announced plans for a $6.5 billion biomanufacturing plant in north Houston. (Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images)Raquel Natalicchio | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Tuesday said it will spend $6 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Alabama, to help boost production of its closely watched experimental obesity pill and other drugs. It is the third facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the drugmaker. Eli Lilly announced in February that it would spend at least $27 billion to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020.The company said it expects construction of the Alabama plant to start in 2026 and for it to be completed in 2032. \"Today's investment continues the onshoring of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production, strengthening supply chain resilience and reliable access to medicines for patients in the U.S.,\" said Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks in a release. That added production capacity for Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, is crucial as the company races to file for its approval and tries to maintain its dominance in the booming market for GLP-1s. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, faced supply shortages for their existing weekly injections after demand skyrocketed in the U.S. in recent years, though they have managed to alleviate those issues.Eli Lily's pill in November won a priority review voucher from the Food and Drug Administration, which will significantly speed up the regulator's assessment of the drug to potentially a few months. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following recent drug pricing deals with Trump that exempt companies from the levies.Eli Lilly said the Alabama site will bring 450 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 3,000 construction jobs. ",

    "body": "Manusapon Kasosod | Moment | Getty ImagesCurrent homeowners are looking for any savings they can get, and with mortgage rates on conventional loans not moving much, that isn't easy. Loans from the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, which require mortgage insurance, however, are providing an outlet.Total applications to refinance a home loan rose 14% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Volume was 88% higher than the same week one year ago. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 58.2% of total applications from 53.0% the previous week. Demand for FHA refinances was up 24% for the week, as the FHA interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate loans fell to 6.08% the lowest level since September 2024. In contrast, the average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.33% from 6.32%, with points rising to 0.60 from 0.58, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 2% for the week and were 19% higher than the same week one year ago. Potential buyers are also turning to the FHA for additional savings.\"Conventional purchase applications were down for the week, but there was a 5 percent increase in FHA purchase applications as prospective homebuyers continue to seek lower downpayment loans,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release. Mortgage rates on conventional loans moved even higher to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. Markets are now waiting for commentary from the Federal Reserve's chair after Wednesday's meeting. It is widely expected the Fed will cut its overnight borrowing rate, but the last two times it did that mortgage rates rose sharply. \"The cut itself is not the news the market is waiting for. Rather, traders are interested to see each Fed member's rate outlook via the quarterly release of the Fed's economic projections,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"In addition, every Fed meeting includes a press conference with the Fed Chair, and bonds have often made the biggest moves in response.\"",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outside the Capitol, Dec. 3, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia on Wednesday responded to a report that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has been using smuggled Blackwell chips to develop its upcoming model. The U.S. has banned the export of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are considered the company's most advanced offerings, to China in an effort to stay ahead in the AI race. DeepSeek is reportedly using chips that were snuck into the country without authorization, according to The Information. \"We haven't seen any substantiation or received tips of 'phantom data centers' constructed to deceive us and our [original equipment manufacturer] partners, then deconstructed, smuggled and reconstructed somewhere else,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \"While such smuggling seems far-fetched, we pursue any tip we receive.\"Read more CNBC tech newsAustralia is trying to enforce the first teen social media ban.

Since the hardware is so crucial for advancing AI technology, Nvidia's relationship with China has become a political flash point among U.S. lawmakers. President Donald Trump on Monday said Nvidia can ship its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere on the condition that the U.S. will get 25% of those sales. The announcement was met with pushback from some Republicans. DeepSeek spooked the U.S. tech sector in January when it released a reasoning model, called R1, that rocketed to the top of app stores and industry leaderboards. R1 was also created at a fraction of the cost of other models in the U.S., according to some analyst estimates. In August, DeepSeek hinted that China will soon have its own \"next generation\" chips to support its AI models.WATCH: Nvidia selling H200 AI chips to China is net positive, says Patrick Moorheadwatch now— CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos contributed to this report.CORRECTION: Nvidia responded to the report that its Blackwell chips are being used by DeepSeek.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump will begin the final interviews of candidates for the Federal Reserve chair this week, putting back on track the formal selection process that began this summer.\"We're going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want,\" Trump said Tuesday night aboard Air Force One to reporters. The interviews by Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will begin with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh on Wednesday and also include Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, at some point, according to two sources. It restarts the process that was derailed a bit last week when interviews with candidates were abruptly canceled.Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council (L), and Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve.ReutersTrump said recently he knew who he was going to pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, and prediction markets overwhelmingly believed it would be Hassett. But his possible selection received some pushback from the markets recently, especially among fixed income investors concerned Hassett would only do Trump's bidding and keep rates too low even if inflation snaps back.So it's unclear if these interviews are a sign Trump has changed his mind or just the final stage of the formal process.CNBC first reported in October that Trump had narrowed the candidate list down to five people. Four of those five will be part of these final interviews. The group also includes current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman as well as BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder.The Fed will likely lower rates for a third time this year on Wednesday, but Powell, whose term as chair is up in May, is expected to strike a cautious tone at his post-meeting news conference on how much lower the central bank will go next year. The Fed's latest forecast released in September called for just one cut next year. A hawkish tone from Powell on Wednesday could further frustrate Trump, who is trying to remake the Fed in a way the favors a lower-rate regime. Trump reiterated in a Politico interview posted Tuesday that he will litmus test the candidates on their willingness to cut rates further.Warsh declined to comment to CNBC.",

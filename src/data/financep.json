Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.\"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power,\" the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.Those boards \"wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers\" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.\"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members,\" ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.\"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency,\" Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.\"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country,\" she wrote. \"Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent.\"Pan added that her colleagues \"redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies.\"This is breaking news.

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. This is breaking news.

    "body": "watch nowNetflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including \"The Sopranos\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\"I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning. \"We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity,\" he said. \"It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.\"The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months. As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders. Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.Edging out ParamountThe merger could invite regulatory scrutiny given the size of the expansive streaming businesses for each company. Netflix said it surpassed 300 million global streaming subscribers at the end of 2024, the last time it publicly reported its customer count. Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 128 million global subscribers as of Sept. 30. Paramount raised the potential for antitrust concerns earlier this week in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management as second-round bids came in, The Wall Street Journal reported. The newly merged Paramount Skydance made its initial run at Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process. The David Ellison-run company was the only suitor bidding for the entirety of WBD's portfolio — the film studio, streaming business and TV networks.Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said. Earlier this week, Paramount raised questions about the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process, contending Warner Bros. Discovery favored Netflix.\"It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,\" Paramount attorneys said in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management.— CNBC's David Faber, Kasey O'Brien and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, are retiring from the company, the iPhone maker announced on Thursday. Jennifer Newstead, Meta's chief legal officer, will become Apple's new general counsel in March, and Jackson's government affairs staff will report to her starting late next year, Apple said. The two executives, who both reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook, are the latest members of senior leadership to exit the company. In recent weeks, Apple's head software designer said he was leaving to join Meta, while Apple said its AI chief was retiring, along with its chief operating officer.Adams joined Apple from Honeywell and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company's privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store's restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company's diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Before that, she spent four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. With her emphasis in areas like social justice and renewable energies, Jackson's job lost relevance during the second Trump administration, which has publicly denounced diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slammed efforts to combat climate change. Apple has faced increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and Cook has met with President Donald Trump several times to tout the company's American manufacturing plans as part of an effort to influence policy. Jackson was instrumental in Apple's launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company's equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report published in 2023.\"At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,\" Jackson wrote in a section of that report. \"We won't delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.\"Jackson also worked on Apple's environmental image. Her job \"focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,\" according to her bio on the company's website. She discussed Apple's plans to become carbon neutral at iPhone launch events.Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple Vice President Lisa Jackson arrive at the White House for a state dinner on April 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesNewstead, who will become Apple's top lawyer, has overseen Meta's legal and regulatory matters pertaining to its family of apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp since 2019. A Meta spokesperson said Newstead will be staying through the end of the year and that the company is actively searching for her replacement.Prior to Meta, Newstead served as a Trump-appointed legal advisor at the State Department during the president's first administration in 2019.  Before that, she was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell and a general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, among other roles in the U.S. government.CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this story.WATCH: Apple AI chief steps downwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee on Thursday deferred crucial votes on hepatitis B vaccines for babies until Friday, saying it will give members more time to review proposed language on the measure. One panel member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, brought a motion to defer the votes following confusion amongst the group about the language. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate a so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

    "body": "Skyscrapers in the Canary Wharf financial, business and shopping district in London, UK.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVisa is moving its European headquarters to London's financial district, hot on the heels of an announcement by JPMorgan that it will build a landmark tower in an area considered to be the city's answer to Wall Street.Visa, whose European headquarters is currently at Paddington in the west of London, has signed a 15-year, 300,000 square foot lease at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, according to Canary Wharf Group. The firm will move in summer of 2028.  It follows news that JPMorgan intends to build a new 3 million square foot tower in the city's historic financial district, while HSBC, BBVA, Barclays, Citibank and others have recommitted to the area in 2025. British fintech Revolut also opened an office in the area in September.  Canary Wharf was hit particularly hard as the coronavirus pandemic fueled a move to hybrid and remote working. The Docklands Core submarket, which includes Canary Wharf, hit record high vacancy rates in the first quarter of 2025, at 18.5%, according to data from CoStar.  There are three main reasons for a resurgence of the district, Shobi Khan, CEO, Canary Wharf Group, told CNBC in September, at which point Canary Wharf's vacancy rate was 6%.First is the convenience of the Elizabeth line railway, which has provided access to the area that has \"never been better,\" as well as the fact the space is now multi-use, featuring residential home and hotels as well as offices. \"And lastly, real estate is about demand and supply. The construction pipeline is basically turning off after 2026 and so rents are being increased, we're pushing rents and getting the benefit of having limited space for occupants to look at,\" Khan said.  \"Canary Wharf is thriving,\" he added. watch nowMore than 750,000 square foot of office leases have been announced in the docklands area this year, marking what Canary Wharf Group said will be its best office leasing year in more than a decade. It is helped by measures announced in the U.K.'s Autumn Budget, which stabilized the longer-term interest rate environment — a key metric for the real estate industry — according to Shabab Qadar, partner and head of London research at Knight Frank. The JPMorgan commitment is \"a huge sign of London is open for business,\" Qadar told \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday. \"London needs rerating. There's a lot of attractive pricing for London offices right now.\" Companies are increasingly requiring employees to return to office and incentivizing them to do so, offering the real estate industry some form of respite from high obsolescence risk thanks in part to pandemic-era shifts in work.  \"Occupiers want their accommodation to be much more conducive to the wellness of employees. There's war for talent, and getting people back in the office, which we've seen increased quite considerably over the last 12 months, is requiring employers to provide the best quality office space for their staff,\" Qadar said. \"People made incorrect decisions when it came to downsizing over the last few years, and we're going to see a period of upsizing now,\" he added. The new three-year stamp duty exemption for companies listing on a U.K. stock exchange will also \"provide a kicker to financial services, particularly in the city,\" Qadar said, however pension reform is also \"critical to raising the attractiveness of London to global investors.\"\"Digital payments power economies right across Europe. This exciting next step will better position us to pioneer the future of payments, giving Europeans access to world-class payment experiences while being offered the highest levels of security, resilience and reliability,\" said Antony Cahill, regional president and CEO of Visa Europe, said in a statement. ",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is welcomed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi upon arrival at the Palam Air Base in New Delhi, India December 4, 2025. Grigory Sysoev | Via ReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin has underlined Moscow's willingness to provide \"uninterrupted shipments of fuel\" to India, as the U.S. pressures New Delhi to give up importing their oil. Putin made the offer during a joint address with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, part of his first visit to the country since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which triggered widespread sanctions.The sanctions forced Russia to seek new customers for its exports. India has become the second biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, after China, with a report Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air showing India bought 38% of Russian crude exports in October.In October, President Donald Trump sanctioned two of Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. This followed a tariff of 25% on India for buying Russian oil in August. But India has to walk a tightrope because it has close ties to the U.S. while also relying on Russia for fuel and access to military hardware.Putin questioned U.S. pressure on India in an interview to an Indian television channel on Thursday.The United States still buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its own nuclear power plants, Putin said in the interview, adding: \"If the U.S. has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?\" While Trump has acknowledged that India has cut back its Russian oil imports, experts told CNBC that this may be a temporary trend. watch nowApart from crude oil, Russia's Rosatom is also delivering reactors and reportedly fuel for India's Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, which has a combined capacity of 6000MW. India and Russia have an energy partnership, the Russian president said, adding that Moscow had been is reliable supplier of \"oil, gas, coal and everything that is required for the development of India's energy\".Last month, India announced a \"historic deal\" with Washington, in which Indian state-owned oil companies signed a one-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S.",

    "body": "An Ulta Beauty store in Concord, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUlta Beauty on Thursday raised its full-year sales outlook after topping Wall Street's fiscal third-quarter expectations and seeing shoppers splurge on perfumes, skincare items and more.The beauty retailer said it now expects net sales for the year to be approximately $12.3 billion, higher than its previous expectations of $12 billion to $12.1 billion. That would would represent an increase from last fiscal year's net sales of $11.3 billion. It expects earnings per share of $25.20 to $25.50, up from its prior expectations of $23.85 to $24.30.It anticipates comparable sales, a metric that includes sales at stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales, to rise by 4.4% to 4.7%, up from its prior outlook of 2.5% to 3.5%. Ulta has raised its sales and profit outlook for two consecutive quarters. The company's stock rose more than 6% in extended trading.In a news release, CEO Kecia Steelman said \"exciting assortment newness, improved in-store and digital experiences, and bold marketing efforts are resonating with our guests and drove strong sales results.\"On the company's earnings call, she said that Ulta is \"pleased with our Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance\" and ready for the shopping season — even one when consumers may be more selective about spending.\"Our insights suggest beauty consumers' budgets are tight and they are focused on value,\" she said. \"Despite this, beauty enthusiasts tell us that they spend intend to spend on beauty for seasonal needs, affordable splurges and gifts for loved ones. They are focused on replenishing their essentials and strategically making smart purchases around strong value.\"Here's what the retailer reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:Earnings per share: $5.14 vs. $4.64 expectedRevenue: $2.86 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedUlta has benefitted from shoppers who have kept spending on beauty, even as they trim the budget or seek out lower-priced options in other discretionary categories. Yet the company faces stiffer competition from a wide range of rivals, including big-box retailers like Walmart, online players like Amazon and upstarts like TikTok Shop. Beauty sales have been strong overall this year in the U.S., according to data from market research firm Circana. In the first nine months of 2025, prestige beauty sales in terms of dollars rose 4% and mass beauty sales rose 5% year over year.According to Circana, beauty is poised to be a popular category during the holidays, with the market researcher's surveys indicating that more consumers plan to gift beauty products than a year ago, particularly those in households with higher-incomes and those with children.Revenue rose from $2.53 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales jumped by 6.3% year over year. Shoppers visited Ulta's stores and websites more and spent more during visits. Average ticket rose 3.8% and transactions increased by 2.4% year over year.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Ulta reported net income of $230.9 million, or $5.14 per share, compared with $242.2 million, or $5.14 per share, in the year-ago quarter.Though consumer confidence is weak, Steelman said on Ulta's earnings call that \"beauty engagement remained healthy.\" She said sales of both mass and prestige beauty items grew by mid single-digits year over year.Fragrance was its strongest category in the quarter, with double-digit sales growth year over year, as shoppers bought luxury scents from Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana and also lower-priced scents like Squishmallows perfumes.Steelman said that in October, Ulta added more shelf space for fragrance in more than 60% of its U.S. stores to try to get ready for higher demand during the holidays and beyond.In skincare, the retailer's second-fastest growing category, sales grew by high single digits year over year, she said. Shoppers bought items they discovered on social media, including Korean or K-beauty brands and purchased merchandise from Rihanna's Fenty Skin Body collection, which launched in the fall.To drive growth, Ulta has also been expanding internationally and launched a third-party marketplace in October. In July, it announced it had acquired Space NK, a British beauty retailer, from Manzanita Capital. The deal allows Ulta to enter a new international market, since Space NK has 83 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland.During the third quarter, Ulta opened seven stores in Mexico through its joint venture partnership with Grupo Bakso. It opened its first Ulta store in the Middle East in Kuwait last month through a franchise partnership with Al-Shabaab.Through its marketplace, Ulta has added more than 120 brands and over 3,500 unique items to its online assortment, Steelman said. She said the company is \"pleased with the initial performance and optimistic about how this new capability can help us strengthen our existing category, attract new guests, and capitalize on incremental growth opportunities in new subcategories,\" such as wellness. Higher tariffs have influenced some of the prices of items carried by Ulta, too. The company saw more brand-driven price increases in the third quarter than the second quarter, interim Chief Financial Officer Chris Lialios said. Sales in the haircare category grew by mid single-digits, despite a sales decline in personal styling tools that have felt pressure from tariff-related price increases, Steelman said.Ulta announced in October that Christopher DelOrefice, the chief financial officer of medical technology company Becton Dickinson & Company, will become its new CFO. He will start in the role on Dec. 5.As of Thursday's close, Ulta's shares have risen about 23% so far this year. That surpasses the S&P 500's nearly 17% gains during the same period.",

    "body": "A general view of the Microsoft office building is seen in Cologne, Germany, on November 18, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMicrosoft said Thursday that it will increase the prices of Office productivity software subscriptions for commercial and government clients on July 1.The company's Office applications, which include Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, have been facing increased competition in recent years from Google. \"We are continuously investing and innovating our platform for the future,\" Nicole Herskowitz, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365 and Copilot, wrote in a blog post. \"In the last year, we released more than 1,100 features across Microsoft 365, Security, Copilot, and SharePoint.\" The new features have added value to the suites, she wrote.Price hikes for commercial Office subscriptions have been infrequent. In 2022, Microsoft raised prices of its productivity bundles for the first time since launching the original Office 365 subscriptions in 2011. Microsoft changed the name of Office 365 to Microsoft 365 in 2020. In January, Microsoft announced a price hike for consumer Office bundles.Microsoft offers Office 365 subscriptions for commercial use that include access to its productivity applications, along with higher-priced Microsoft 365 subscriptions that also include Windows operating system updates.Here's a breakdown of the commercial price changes:For small and medium-sized businesses, Microsoft 365 Business Basic will cost $7 per person per month, up from $6.Microsoft 365 Business Standard will be available for $14, up from $12.50.Microsoft 365 Business Premium will continue to cost $22.The entry-level Office 365 E1 offering for enterprises will still be sold for $10.Office 365 E3 will jump 13% to $26 from $23.The Microsoft 365 E3 package including Windows for enterprises will rise 8% to $39 from $36.The full-featured Microsoft 365 E5 will increase to $60 from $57.For front-line workers such as cashiers, Microsoft 365 F1 subscriptions will cost $3, up from $2.25.Microsoft 365 F3 will be available for $10, up from $8.The U.S. Defense Department and other government clients will face similar percentage price increases.The various subscriptions all exclude access to the $30 Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on that draws on generative artificial intelligence models. Some companies have started widely rolling out Copilot, while others have held off on expanding their deployments, CNBC reported last week.In many cases, organizations receive discounts off of list prices, but Microsoft has cut back on direct volume deals for some types of customers.Almost 43% of Microsoft's $77.7 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue came from its Productivity and Businesses Processes segment, which includes Office. In October, the company said revenue from Microsoft 365 commercial cloud services jumped 17%, while seats increased 6%, mainly from products targeting small and medium-sized businesses and front-line workers.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin smiles while visiting the We Are Together Fourm and Awards Ceremony, on December 3, 2025 in Moscow, Russia. Contributor | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has warned Moscow will take Ukrainian territory by force if Kyiv's troops do not withdraw, signaling rigidity over a key sticking point in peace talks. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms, or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin, who is currently on a state visit to India, said in an interview with India Today. The comments, published by Russian state-controlled media, were translated by news agency Reuters and made in reference to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.Russia is estimated to control more than 80% of the Donbas, where fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists started long before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022. The war in the region first began in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea — a peninsular in southern Ukraine. Capturing and officially annexing the Donbas region would enable Russia to create a land bridge to Crimea, a crucial military and trading hub for Moscow. Under occupation, so-called referendums have shown up to 99% of residents in parts of the Donbas region voted to join the Russian Federation. Those referendums have been widely criticized as sham votes by the international community. Putin's comments came after he held a five-hour meeting with U.S. delegates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner — U.S. President Donald Trump's son in law — in Moscow on Tuesday. During Thursday's interview with India Today, Putin said Russia did not agree with some of the points outlined in the reworked U.S. peace proposals for Ukraine, labeling the negotiation process \"difficult work.\"'Unlikely any time soon'The original 28-point peace plan — drawn up by Russian and American officials, with no input from Ukraine — reportedly included a requirement that Ukraine concede territory in the Donbas to Russia. It was redrafted following talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that any peace deal must honor Ukrainian sovereignty. Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and East European politics at the University of Oxford, told CNBC on Friday that the war would only end when Russia stops attacking Ukraine. \"Given the Kremlin shows a lack of genuine interest in ending the conflict, no peace agreement is likely any time soon,\" she said. \"Russia has failed to take Donbas by force since 2014, as Ukrainians have made clear they will not accept the illegal capture of their territory. No 'deal' is possible without Ukrainians' support, and nearly 12 years of resistance show that they are unwilling to support territorial concessions.\"watch nowEmily Ferris, a senior research fellow at defense and security thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, agreed that Moscow is unlikely to be truly invested in making peace in Ukraine without land concessions being on the table. \"Currently, Russia sees no reason to come to the negotiating table because it is making – admittedly small – gains on the battlefield and there is no offer that meets their demands,\" she told CNBC. \"The two sticking points are European military support for Ukraine – the so-called security guarantees and what that actually means – and of course the territorial issue, which Moscow is counting on Ukraine to compromise on.\"Speaking at the 2025 Investor Summit conference at the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, Kim Darroch, who served as the U.K.'s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump's first term, said he did not believe an end to the conflict in Ukraine was imminent. \"I don't think the war is going to end anytime soon, unless the Ukrainians agree to capitulate and give up territory, plus to never join NATO and this kind of stuff which I think is basically impossible to concede and survive politically,\" he told an audience. \"So, I think the war will drag on through the winter and beyond, which potentially is very dangerous for Europe, because I think if Trump can't get a deal he may just walk away and stop weapons supplies to Ukraine and tell the Europeans, 'it's your problem, I tried to get a deal, so you do it.' And then I'm not sure we actually have the capacity to provide Ukraine with what it needs.\" Global investors have been closely monitoring developments in the negotiations, with a breakthrough likely to have implications for markets across asset classes. Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sparked an international sell-off of equities and huge volatility in energy markets as the Western world drastically reduced trade and investment in Russia. Concerns about Russian aggression have also led to a huge defense splurge across Europe, fueling a bull run on regional defense stocks. — CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this article. ",

    "body": "Starbucks Workers United demonstrates outside of the Empire State Building as the union's strike enters its third week.CNBC | Amelia LucasNEW YORK — Starbucks Workers United held a rally outside the Empire State Building on Thursday as its open-ended strike entered its third week and no signs of an impending resolution.Adding to the crunch of holiday shoppers and tourists, several hundred picketers gathered outside of the famous landmark, which is also the site of a swanky three-floor Starbucks Reserve location and the company's regional headquarters. Members of other unions, like the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union, which is affiliated with Workers United, protested alongside baristas, chanting \"No coffee, no contract\" and \"What's disgusting? Union busting\" between speakers.\"Their fight is a fight really for all of us, to workers across the country, to corporations like Starbucks, across the country that workers are fed up with the status quo, and they're not going to take it anymore,\" SEIU President April Verrett told CNBC.Twelve demonstrators were arrested for blocking the building's entrance.Baristas launched the strike on Starbucks Red Cup Day last month, seeking new proposals from the company that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. Out of the 145 locations involved in the strike, 55 remain closed, according to a company spokesperson. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.While the strike has injected uncertainty into Starbucks' busy holiday season, the company has said its sales haven't been affected. CEO Brian Niccol told employees that Red Cup Day was its strongest in history. A successful holiday season will be key to the chain's turnaround under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.The New York City rally comes after the company paid $38.9 million to settle violations of the city's Fair Workweek Law. Other large restaurant employers, like Chipotle, have previously run afoul of the law, which Starbucks said is \"notoriously challenging\" to navigate.The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found Starbucks committed half a million violations of the law since 2021. The Fair Workweek law requires regular scheduling week to week, mandates schedules be provided 14 days in advance and says hours cannot be reduced by more than 15% without legitimate business reasons. DCWP Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, who spoke at Thursday's rally, said the timing of the record-breaking settlement with the ongoing strike was coincidental.\"While the NYC laws remain unchanged and complex, our focus hasn't shifted – we're committed to creating the best job in retail and to ensuring our practices follow all laws,\" Starbucks said in a statement.The city's current Mayor Eric Adams and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have rallied behind striking workers. Mamdani joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., alongside baristas in Brooklyn earlier this week.Both Starbucks and the union have pointed blame at the other for failing to reach a bargaining agreement and maintain they are ready to speak when the other is. The two parties entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. The company has said it is investing $500 million to improve the employee experience as part of its \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. That investment includes upgrading its scheduling technology and adding more baristas to rosters. \"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened. Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement.",

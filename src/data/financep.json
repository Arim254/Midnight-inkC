    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Concept Ventures was an early investor in billion dollar AI firm Eleven Labs.Reece ChowdhuryA venture capitalist says one of the biggest reasons startups fail hinges on the relationship between co-founders.Reece Chowdhry, founding partner of Concept Ventures, said early teams often split within two years because their co-founders clash or lack a shared vision. His venture capital firm, founded in 2018, says it is Europe's largest pre-seed fund, which focuses on startups at the ideation stage. It recently announced it had raised $88 million for its newest fund.Chowdhry told CNBC Make It that he invests based on founders' personalities and traits before they even have a product. There are four to five key traits he looks for in a startup before going all-in, Chowdhry explained.\"I think 80% of our decision is on founders and we are typically the first investor in every company we invest in,\" Chowdhry said in the interview. \"The number one reason companies typically fail in the first 18 to 24 months is that founders fall out with each other or don't get along, don't have the same vision alignment, purpose, and so that is something that we think is really important,\" he said. In the initial meeting with founders, Chowdhry emphasized that co-founder chemistry is one of the key characteristics he looks for. \"One of the things we're very obsessed with is 'How well do you know each other? Have you gone through something meaningful in life? If I interview you both separately, will the answers also match? What will that person's strengths be? What will that person's weaknesses be? And do you intimately know each other?\"If I gave the New York Times' dating questions, would they match up to a level where you would really  intimately know people at their core?\"Other core traits that Chowdhry looks for in founders include an obsession with a specific field or industry, relentlessness and grit, a growth mindset, and evidence of exceptionalism in something outside of work, such as sports or chess. Concept Ventures was an early backer of $3 billion voice AI company Eleven Labs, co-founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski. Chowdhry said two key traits in his meeting with Eleven Labs' co-founders stood out and persuaded him to invest. \"The two things that stood out were domain obsession, so literally thinking about that problem for a long time and the team dynamics. They were like childhood friends. They knew each other super well. They complemented each other really well,\" he added. 'The whole package'Y-Combinator co-founder and startup guru Paul Graham shared similar wisdom in a blog. He warned that solo founders faced an uphill climb, noting that most successful startups have at least two or three founders. In one post, Graham wrote that a startup with only one founder is \"a vote of no confidence\" because it suggests they couldn't convince any of their friends to join.  However, failure is possible, even with multiple founders. \"The relationship between the founders has to be strong. They must genuinely like one another and work well together. Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be,\" Graham said. Concept Venture's Chowdhry added that his investment decisions in early-stage startups involve examining \"the whole package,\" rather than just one founder.\"It has to be a package and I think what many VCs optimize for is they'll meet the CEO typically and they'll put a lot of lens on the CEO, although 50% of the business is two people or three people,\" he explained.He noted that many companies being built in Europe have very technical founders, but he looks for a founding team with complementary skill sets. \"It's not just technical and non-technical. Is one a very fast thinker, and the other ones are balancing them out. A slow thinker slows the other person down. Does one have magnetism, as in they can attract world-class talent to them,\" he added. ",

    "body": "Despite slower job growth compared to the last decade, the U.S. economy is expected to add 5.2 million jobs from 2024 to 2034, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest employment projection report. Total employment is projected to grow by 3.1%.Based on the report, the top-growing industry sectors for 2034 are health care and social assistance and professional, scientific and technical services, which have projected growth rates of 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively.Within those sectors, the fastest-growing occupational groups are health-care support, which includes roles like nurse practitioner and physician assistant, and computer and mathematical roles, such as data scientist and information security analyst. These groups are expected to grow by 12.4% and 10.1%, respectively.One of the main reasons that the health-care industry is expected to grow so rapidly is because the American population is aging, according to Emily Krutsch, branch chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\"That's really what's driving that trend: the older population tends to need more of this type of care and services,\" she says.Computer and mathematical roles will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology, according to Krutsch.\"We are expecting a boost in employment growth for occupations that would be involved in developing and testing and implementing these types of tools,\" Krutsch says.Relatedly, information security analyst roles are projected to grow significantly due to the \"larger need to protect data and develop systems and tools to secure it,\" she says.Krutsch emphasizes that the growth rate for each job isn't the only important data point to consider.For example, wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers are the two fastest-growing jobs, but both occupations combined will add under 20,000 jobs by 2034. \"Just because we're talking about fast growth doesn't necessarily translate to lots of jobs, because it could just be a very, very small occupation,\" Krutsch says.Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data, these are the fastest-growing occupations for 2034, as well as the expected increase in jobs by 2034 and the current median salary for each role.1.

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 airplane approaches San Diego International Airport for a landing from Las Vegas on May 9, 2025 in San Diego, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of European aerospace giant Airbus fell more than 10% on Monday morning, following reports the company has discovered an industrial quality issue regarding dozens of A320-family aircraft. The flaw, which is said to affect the aircraft's fuselage panels, is delaying some deliveries but there are no immediate indications that it has reached aircraft in service, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. Airbus was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.Paris-listed shares of Airbus plunged to the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on the news. The stock was last seen down 10%, on track for its biggest daily drop since March 2020, according to LSEG data.The latest report comes after Airbus said the vast majority of the roughly 6,000 A320-family aircraft impacted by a software glitch over the weekend had now received the necessary modifications.In a statement published Monday, Airbus apologized for delays caused to passengers and airlines impacted by the issue, which affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.The directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.— CNBC's Victor Loh contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how saf",
    "body": "Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:1. Self-regulate before you reconnectBefore your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.2. Lead with connection, not correctionBefore asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: \"You matter more than the morning rush.\"This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.3. Create pockets of calm amid chaosIntegrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.4. Find moments for laughterEven in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.5. Check in emotionally, not just logisticallyBefore diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: \"How's your heart this morning?\" or \"What's one thing you're looking forward to today?\"These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.6. Make physical touch non-negotiableA morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.7. Create a screen-free sanctuaryMake mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 8. Honor the power of slownessChildren live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child’s natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.9. Create a bridge before goodbyeInstead of rushing out with a quick \"Let's go,\" pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.Then add a \"connection bridge,\" or something to look forward to later: \"I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight,\" or \"Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning.\"Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Holiday Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Intel stock held a sharp hike in pretrading on Monday, after the stock surged on Friday when an analyst predicted the chip giant was nearing a deal to supply Apple in 2027. Shares in Intel rose 10% on Friday after TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X that he expected Intel to begin shipping its lowest-end M processor to Apple as early as second or third quarter 2027. He said that his latest industry surveys indicate that \"visibility on Intel becoming an advanced-node supplier to Apple has recently improved significantly.\"Intel stock fell 0.59% as of 6.26am ET on Monday in early pretrading.Kuo added that the timeline of the partnership is contingent on the development process after Intel releases its process design kit — the blueprint from which Apple's engineers can build the chips — which is expected early 2026.watch nowApple's silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products are currently supplied by TSMC.In his post, Kuo played down the potential Intel-Apple partnership's impact on the Taiwanese chip maker, saying that Apple is expected to remain \"highly dependent\" on the company's advanced nodes for the \"foreseeable future.\"\"In absolute terms, order volumes for the lowest-end M processor are relatively small and virtually no material impact on TSMC's fundamentals or its technology leadership over the next several years.\"Kuo added a deal with Intel would signal strong support from Apple for the Trump administration's push for its homegrown companies to manufacture in the U.S.Neither Intel nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment from CNBC.'If Intel pulls it off, there is potential to win higher volume and value business from Apple'Intel's stock has seen a resurgence over the past 12 months after years of decline. Share price fell as low as $17.66 in April, before recovering over the past few months.\"Apple is a potential major reference customer whose presence validates Intel's high-performance foundry offering,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Global Equities, told CNBC.\"If Intel pulls it off, there is potential to win higher volume and value business from Apple, for example CPU production for the iPhone, and win business from other large chip designers.\"Intel has had an up and down relationship with Apple since it first announced the chip giant's processors would power some products in 2005. The iPhone maker transitioned away from the company's processors at the start of the 2020s.Last week Intel was on the subject of a lawsuit filed by TSMC, in which it alleged one of its former senior vice president had leaked \"confidential information\" to the company. Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment at the time.",

The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing.

Mikhail Metzel | Via ReutersAll eyes are on Russia this week as talks over a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine shift to Moscow and step up a gear.U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is travelling to Russia on Monday and is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for discussions on a U.S.-backed 19-point peace plan. Ukraine has tentatively supported the fledgling peace proposals, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it too can work with the framework agreement.The latest plan is an amended version of an initial 28-point plan, reported several weeks ago, that had been devised by the U.S. and Moscow without Ukraine's involvement, and which favored Russia.Russia will be eager to have its say on the amended proposals after a flurry of diplomacy and discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in the last week and talks being in Florida on Sunday. Whether Putin will play ball when it comes to a new peace plan is a big unknown, however, with Russia feeling like it has both the advantage on the battlefield and U.S. President Donald Trump's ear when it comes to the outlines of a future peace deal. The Kremlin confirmed that Witkoff and Putin will meet on Tuesday.Will Putin play ball?Putin and Kremlin officials have reacted cautiously to the amended peace plan so far, signalling that Russia is ready to talk but that the war in Ukraine might not necessarily end soon.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said during a trip to Kyrgyzstan. He added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" with Witkoff.

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesBut Putin also praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting there would only stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas.If they did not do so, Putin said, Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives of having full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.Read moreAnalysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted in analysis on Sunday that Russian military bloggers appear skeptical that Putin will compromise when it comes to his territorial demands on Ukraine.\"Russian information space voices continue to argue that the Kremlin will likely reject a ceasefire or any iteration of the U.S.-proposed peace plan because the Kremlin views these efforts as inconsequential and as a hindrance to Russia's goals in Ukraine and globally,\" ISW analysts noted Sunday.'Delicate' processThe lead up to the latest diplomatic scramble for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia comes after some seesawing from the White House over its position on how the war should end and what concessions are needed in order for a ceasefire. President Trump has vacillated over his support for Ukraine and has appeared, at times, to support Russia's demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. He has then backtracked, stating that Kyiv's forces can win back all their land, muddying the waters as to where het stands on a peace settlement.Following talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the process toward a peace deal was \"delicate\" and that Russia's position needed to be factored in to any deal.He said the four-hour long talks — which included Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as a Ukrainian delegation headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Ustem Rumerov — had been productive but that more work was left to be done. \"So much work remains, but today was, again, a very productive and useful session where I think additional progress was made,\" Rubio told reporters after the talks.",

    "body": "Workers assemble mobile phones at a Dixon Technologies factory in Noida, India, on Jan. 28, 2021. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia's industrial production grew just 0.4% in October, a 14-month low that indicated a sharp slowdown in the economy.The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) fell short of September's 4% growth and is even lower than the 3.1% expected by economists in a Reuters poll.Domestic consumption improved across major consumer categories, after a goods and services tax cut took effect Sept. 22.The Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation said the slow industrial production growth could be due to fewer number of working days because of a number of festivals including Dussehra and Deepawali. It is the lowest increase since August 2024.Output in the manufacturing sector rose just 1.8% in October vs 4.8% in September, while mining activity and electricity production deteriorated 1.8% and 6.9% respectively.The growth rates of the three sectors, Mining, Manufacturing and Electricity for the month of October 2025 are -1.8%, 1.8% and -6.9% respectively. October has been a key month for the economy, as New Delhi rolled out the GST reductions to spur domestic consumption and soften the blow from the 50% U.S. tariff on Indian goods.Despite the tariffs, the Indian economy grew faster than expected in the quarter ending in September, at an , up from 7.8% in the previous quarter.Dipti Deshpande, principal economist at S&P Global owned Indian research and credit rating company Crisil, said \"sturdy consumption demand\" will partially offset the negative impact of weaker export demand between October and December, benefitting the manufacturing sector. Robust rural incomes, low inflation, reduced interest rates and tax relief \"should keep consumption healthy\" she said, adding that government is however \"likely to moderate its capex in H2 [October-March] to meet fiscal deficit target amid subdued tax collections.\"The IIP data tracks short-term changes in output across a basket of industrial products. Eight core industries, including steel, cement, electricity, and fertilizer, account for 40% of the index's weight.In September, IIP growth held steady at 4.0% as businesses built inventories ahead of a 5-day festive season in October.",

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz.So it was perhaps unsurprising that a new inheritance tax was resoundingly rejected by voters on Sunday. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% was defeated with 78% voting against it. Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse called talk of the inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion.\"It welcomed the proposal's defeat, saying: \"The threat of forced sales of companies and the resulting weakening of the business location have convinced those entitled to vote from all political camps.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. Money raised from the tax would have been earmarked to fund policies to combat climate change, with the party saying it would \"channel billions into climate protection every year while simultaneously combating extreme wealth inequality.\"watch now'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Before the vote, close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative, first proposed in 2024, had already shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, had threatened to leave the country if the tax became law. He told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge, from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" watch now\"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"One potential impact of the 50% tax, if implemented, would have been a fall in tax revenue, according to  Legge. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.But although Switzerland faces competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, Legge said Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowGiorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, agreed that Switzerland remains in a strong position. \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management,\" he told CNBC last week. \"We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"",

    "body": "Chinese-made automobiles and construction machinery are assembled and shipped for export at Yantai Port in Yantai City, Shandong Province, China, on October 21, 2025.  Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity unexpectedly contracted in November, according to a private survey released Monday, as soft domestic demand continued to cast a pall over the world's second-largest economy. The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, conducted by S&P Global, dropped to 49.9 in November, missing analysts' expectations of 50.5 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark level suggests an expansion, while one below that indicates contraction.  The private survey, which has typically painted a better picture than the official polls because it focuses on export-oriented manufacturers, signaled a slowdown from 51.2 in September and 50.6 in October. The official manufacturing PMI, released on Sunday, showed China's factory activity shrank for an eighth month in November, coming in at 49.2, although marking a modest improvement from 49.0 in the prior month.  The RatingDog private survey covers 650 manufacturers and collects responses in the second half of each month, while the official PMI surveys a larger sample of over 3,000 companies at month-end.  \"Manufacturing production growth came to a halt as new orders nearly stalled in November,\" S&P Global and RatingDog said in a statement, despite a notable recovery in new export orders, which expanded at the quickest pace in eight months. \"Manufacturers reduced their workforce and purchasing volume, and became more cautious in inventory management,\" said Yao Yu, founder of financial technology company RatingDog, amid a slowdown in new business growth.Yu expects a \"weak expansion\" in factory activity in December as policymakers work toward the annual growth target of \"around 5%.\" Separately, the official non-manufacturing PMI, comprising construction and services, fell to 49.5, marking the first contraction for the index since December 2022, the official data showed, dragged by weakness in the real estate and residential services sectors. Economic downswing The readings offered an early glimpse of how the economy fared in November after a slew of data showed the economic slowdown worsened in the final quarter of this year, amid a prolonged housing downturn and sluggish domestic demand. Fixed-asset investment, which covers real estate, declined 1.7% in the first ten months of the year, levels unseen since 2020 when the pandemic hit. For October alone, fixed-asset investment fell 11.4% from a year earlier, the worst reading since early 2020. Property investment extended declines, shrinking 14.7% in the first ten months, widening from 13.9% in the first three quarters.  watch nowIndustrial output expanded 4.9% in October from a year earlier, while growth in retail sales slowed for a fifth straight month to 2.9%. Both marked their weakest levels since August 2024, according to LSEG data. Signaling further economic malaise, China's exports in October unexpectedly contracted for the first time in nearly two years, dropping 1.1% year on year, as businesses' front-loading momentum tapered off.  The latest economic data suggested China's growth is likely to decelerate further to below 4.5% in the fourth quarter, said Tommy Xie, managing director and head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank, from the 4.8% expansion in the third quarter.    The economist pointed to the upcoming Politburo meeting and the Central Economic Work Conference later this month for policymakers' signals on next year's economic priorities. Tensions with the U.S. have, however, eased after a temporary trade truce following President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October. Washington agreed to roll back steep tariffs on Chinese exports in exchange for Beijing cracking down on illicit fentanyl trade, pausing export controls of rare earths and resuming purchases of American soybeans. The U.S. also agreed to suspend for one year the port fees levied on Chinese vessels, as well as its plans to bar certain Chinese firms from its technology. While the trade truce may help reduce the uncertainty, \"a meaningful demand recovery is unlikely to come easily,\" economists at Bank of America said in a note on Monday, as domestic consumption and investment remain under pressure and the policy boost on government funding for infrastructure investment has yet to kick in.  The Wall Street bank expects deflation risks to persist in the economy next year as \"the aggregate demand [is] likely to stay sluggish for longer.\" Mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.36% on Monday while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged up 0.74%. The offshore yuan last traded at 7.0711 against the greenback. ",

    "body": "Strathroy | Istock | Getty ImagesFor nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left.Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world.\"I hope this all works out,\" Dioguardi said. \"I have no idea if it will.\"Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. 'A gut punch'As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year.Craftsman working with compressed air at tombstone.Kzenon | Istock | Getty ImagesDioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad.\"God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,\" Dioguardi said. \"We have nothing like that in our country.\"Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs.In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%.He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result.\"There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,\" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. \"But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.\"In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect.Milano's showroom and a memorial made by the business.Courtesy: Jim MilanoBecause the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S.\"The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,\" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades.Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices.Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term.blank stone gravestones and grave slabs in outdoor rural granite workshop.Krimkate | Istock | Getty ImagesBut memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers.\"It's hard,\" Milano said. \"We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'\"A changing businessEven before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials.The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029.Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one.He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a \"rainbow bridge\" memorial that contains the ashes of pets.\"Cremation has changed our business tremendously,\" Dioguardi said. \"It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments. Call it 'financial nihilism.'Americans are getting flashbacks to 2008 as tariffs stoke recession fearsIs that a #RecessionIndicator? Social media users find concerning economic omens in places you wouldn't expectIf monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits.To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand.Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry members say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment.\"Forget about making the pyramid,\" Dioguardi said. \"I don't even know if they want a pebble.\"",

Holloway | Getty ImagesTrading gradually resumed after coming to a standstill on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday, as a cooling issue at one of its data centers impacted traders across the globe. Stock futures and options trading reopened fully at 8:30 a.m. ET, with other services gradually being restored. Bonds and metals resumed trading after a pause, according to FactSet data, while individual stocks were still trading the premarket.\"All CME Group markets are open and trading,\" a CME Group spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Earlier, representatives for CME Group had told CNBC markets were halted due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, adding that it may take some time for moves in the impacted contracts to be seen once the outage is resolved. watch nowGlobex futures and options markets, foreign exchange platform EBS markets and BMD markets were all impacted. EBS markets reopened at 7 a.m. ET, around 90 minutes after its subsidiary BrokerTec EU markets resumed trading.The CME — the largest exchange operator in the world by market value — trades futures and options across various asset classes, including agricultural commodities, energy, metals and equities. Cooling issueEarlier, a spokesperson for Dallas, Texas-headquartered CyrusOne told CNBC the company was actively responding to a cooling system issue at its CHI1 data center facility in the Chicago area, which had impacted customers including CME Group. \"On November 27, our CHI1 facility experienced a chiller plant failure affecting multiple cooling units,\" they said in an email. \"Our engineering teams, along with specialized mechanical contractors, are on-site working to restore full cooling capacity. We have successfully restarted several chillers at limited capacity and have deployed temporary cooling equipment to supplement our permanent systems.\"CyrusOne's representative said the firm was in direct contact with all affected customers, and its teams were \"working around the clock to restore normal operations as quickly and safely as possible.\"\"We apologize for any disruption this has caused and appreciate the patience of our customers as we work toward full resolution,\" they added. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told CNBC it was fortunate the outage had come on one of the slowest trading days of the year in the U.S., just after Thanksgiving. \"It appears as though they are gradually starting to restore some operations,\" he said. \"All told this could have been much worse.\"Emir Syazwan, a futures trader at Ninefold Trading Co. based in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, told CNBC on Friday that he had been on the phone to his broker \"throughout the afternoon\" local time as the CME outage dragged on. watch nowGiven the timing of the outage — at the end of the week, just after a major U.S. holiday and in the early hours of the morning for American traders — Syazwan said those trading in the Asian or European session would be more directly impacted. Whether it will create \"lasting distortions\" in markets depends on how fast the issue can be resolved, he added. \"It's inconvenient, but it's not unprecedented, although this kind of event may materially alter market structure or price discovery,\" he said. \"Current price action already reflects markets being affected: the markets have been relatively flat and trading in a very tight range since 26 November, Wednesday, around ~10 PM EST. And until the issue is resolved, I would expect that behaviour and price action to continue.\"It's not the first time the CME has had to shut down electronic trade. Back in 2014, technical issues shut down some trading on the CME's Globex electronic system, impacting agricultural contracts. Last year, trading of equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds was also temporarily halted in Switzerland after stock exchange SIX had problems disseminating data. Syazwan's own trades have not been impacted, he told CNBC.\"I had already anticipated the major markets — especially the U.S. indices — to consolidate until the start of next year, so I went on early holiday at the beginning of the month,\" he said. — CNBC's Lisa Kailai Han and Matt Ward-Perkins contributed to this article.

    "body": "watch nowAfter a battle over immigration policies and international student visas, fewer new international students chose to study on U.S. college campuses this fall, which comes at a significant economic cost.In the fall 2025 semester, the tally of new international students studying in the U.S. sank 17%, according to a fall snapshot from the U.S. Department of State and the Institute of International Education released earlier this month. Altogether, international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed nearly $55 billion to the U.S. economy over the 2024-25 academic year, including tuition revenue as well as student spending, according to the IIE's Open Doors report.This year's sharp enrollment decline — largely due to the Trump administration's changes to the student visa policy — is projected to cost the economy $1.1 billion, according to a separate analysis from NAFSA: Association of International Educators.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageThat 'free' money in your 401(k) may not belong to you just yetAI data center 'frenzy' is pushing up your electric bill — here's why'Buyers may be a little disappointed' by Black Friday car deals: analystIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

Fewer new students from abroad also enrolled for the fall 2024 semester, notching the first decline since 2020-2021, during the Covid pandemic, according to the Open Doors data. More restrictive student visa policies in the U.S. and changing attitudes abroad about studying here were factors contributing to that decline, other research shows. \"A close read of enrollment figures from last year and this fall shows that the pipeline of global talent in the United States is in a precarious position,\" Fanta Aw, NAFSA's executive director and CEO, said in a statement. \"The ripple effects of these policy changes are being felt across campuses and communities around the world,\" Aw said.The impact on U.S. collegesWhile the decline in international enrollment has broader economic effects, colleges and universities and the students they serve are the hardest hit.In addition to the value of international student perspectives, foreign students typically pay full tuition, which makes international enrollment an important source of revenue for colleges and universities, according to Open Doors' survey of more than 825 institutions. With fewer new students and tuition dollars coming in, there are fewer resources for faculty, programs, and financial aid for U.S. students. Those funds support colleges' ability to provide financial assistance, Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, previously told CNBC. \"Full-paying international students pay scholarships for domestic students — it's a 1-to-1 relationship,\" Mitchell said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

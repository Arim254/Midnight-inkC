    "body": "GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen.CNBCGameStop has laid out a a massive, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen that will only pay out if the video game retailer's stock and profits soar to levels far beyond anything it has achieved to date.The board of GameStop granted Cohen performance-based stock options tied to a $100 billion market-capitalization target and $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to a statement released Wednesday. Under the terms of the plan, Cohen receives nothing unless the minimum thresholds are met, and there is no partial credit if targets are missed. If GameStop fails to reach at least $20 billion in market capitalization and $2 billion in cumulative EBITDA, none of the options will vest.GameStop shares slid 36% last year and the company currently has a market cap of $9.3 billion. The company reported a net income of $77.1 million in the third quarter. If Cohen hits the goals, the total award will be for stock options to purchase 171,537,327 shares of GameStop's Class A common stock at a price of $20.66 per share.Cohen, who joined the board in January 2021 and later became CEO, has been the central figure in GameStop's post-meme-stock transformation. The company has made a few moves aimed at broadening its business beyond physical video-game sales, including an expansion into collectibles, trading cards as well as buying bitcoin aggressively with its corporate cash. What remains absent, however, is a clear master plan for how those initiatives translate into the scale of growth implied by the compensation targets. The compensation structure, the company said, is intended to align Cohen's incentives directly with long-term shareholder returns by tying his compensation entirely to what it called \"extraordinary growth.\"",

Marco Bello | ReutersJPMorgan said its asset management division has fully parted ways with controversial proxy advisors for shareholder votes. In an internal memo, the firm said it no longer needs third-party data collection or voting recommendations. Instead, it launched an artificial intelligence tool, Proxy IQ, to aggregate and analyze proxy data from 3,000 annual company meetings. Proxy advisors such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis typically provide research and voting recommendations. JPMorgan said it is the first major investment firm to eliminate reliance on such companies. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news earlier Wednesday.Proxy advisors have been under fire from President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in December to reassess existing rules. Trump said the proxy advisors \"regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk also lashed out at proxy advisors last October, calling them \"corporate terrorists,\" after ISS recommended shareholders reject his nearly $1 trillion pay package.",

    "body": "Downtown AmsterdamJacobh | E+ | Getty ImagesEuro zone inflation stood at 2% in December, flash data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.Economists polled by Reuters had expected the inflation rate to cool to 2%, in line with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target. In November, the inflation rate stood at 2.1%. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, stood at 2.3% in the year to December, down from 2.4% in November, while the annual rate of services inflation cooled to 3.4%, compared with 3.5% in November.The ECB held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the fourth consecutive time in December, having last cut rates in June.The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from 2024's record high of 4%.Top ECB board members told CNBC late last year that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end, although the central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting.The euro and Stoxx 600 were unchanged on Wednesday following the data release, although the inflation rate returning to the ECB's target could signal further rate cuts ahead.\"The move should please equity markets, as it gives the ECB yet another reason to cut interest rates further in 2026. That said, inflation has been hovering either side of the 2% level for most of last year, so today's move is minor, but a positive, nonetheless,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, said in emailed comments Wednesday. \"Central bankers walk a tightrope, attempting to stimulate the economy without igniting inflation. But with inflation low and steady, they should be able to take their foot off the brake and lean towards more stimulus sooner rather than later.\"",

    "body": "watch nowVenezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely, sources close to the White House told CNBC on Wednesday. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil, which will be sold at market prices. \"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States,\" Trump said in a social media post. The 50 million barrels are only the first tranche and shipments will continue indefinitely, the sources said. U.S. sanctions against Venezuela will be selectively rolled back to enable the transportation and sale of the oil on global markets, the sources said. Proceeds from the oil sales will settle in U.S. controlled accounts, the sources said, with the money released back to Venezuela at the discretion of the U.S., they said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright later confirmed the plan at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs in Miami on Wednesday.\"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela,\" Wright said. \"First this backed up, stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace.\" Previously, the sanctioned oil would have gone mostly to China but will now be re-routed to the U.S. instead. Trump said Tuesday that storage ships will transport the oil directly to receiving docks in the U.S. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. But it is only producing about 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. The U.S., by contrast, is currently producing about 13.8 million bpd.A majority of Venezuela's oil exports are shipped to China. Trump has made clear that U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil sector is a central objective of the military action that ousted President Nicolas Maduro last Saturday. The president has called on major U.S. oil companies to rebuild the South American nation's energy infrastructure system, from wellheads to pipelines, though the companies have so far been largely silent. Wright will meet with oil executives about Venezeula at the Goldman conference. \"Secretary Wright remains in close contact with U.S. oil companies and plans to meet with several of them at the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami on Wednesday,\" a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC. ",

Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate sector job creation turned positive in December though at a bit softer pace than expected, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.Companies added 41,000 hires for the month, a reversal from the loss of 29,000 in November, providing a positive sign for a labor market that otherwise struggled as 2025 came to a close. Private company payrolls had declined in three of the four months before the December release.The final tally was slightly less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 48,000. Payroll growth came entirely in services industries as education and health-related fields added 39,000 jobs and leisure and hospitality contributed 24,000. Trade, transportation and utilities gained 11,000 while financial services rose by 6,000.Offsetting those gains were losses of 29,000 in professional and business services and 12,000 in information services. Goods-producing industries lost 3,000, due primarily to a drop of 5,000 in manufacturing.Nearly all the job gains came in companies employing fewer than 500 workers. Larger firms added just 2,000.\"Small establishments recovered from November job losses with positive end-of-year hiring, even as large employers pulled back,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson.The November total was revised form an initially reported loss of 32,000.Wage gains continued to be tempered, with those staying in their jobs seeing an average annual increase of 4.4%, unchanged from November, while job changers saw gains of 6.6%, or 0.3 percentage point better than the prior month.The report comes two days ahead of the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS data collection had been hampered by the government shutdown. This will be the first on-time release of the report since the impasse was resolved.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect 73,000 new jobs for the month, up from 64,000 in November, while the unemployment rate is seen edging down to 4.5%.

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates moved lower to end 2025 and start 2026, but that did little to pull demand back to the market. For the week ended Jan. 2, 2026, total mortgage application volume fell 9.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis from two weeks earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. There were additional adjustments made for the holidays, and the read is for two weeks because the MBA did not report last week. Over those two weeks, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.25% from 6.32%, with points dropping to 0.57 from 0.59, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the lowest level since September 2024.Applications to refinance a home loan declined 14% over the two-week period, but were still 133% higher than the same week one year ago. \"FHA refinance applications saw a 19 percent increase, although that was a partial rebound from a drop the week before,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in the release. \"MBA continues to expect mortgage rates to stay around current levels, with spells of refinance opportunities in the weeks when rates move lower.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 6% from two weeks earlier and were 10% higher year over year. \"The average loan size was $408,700, the smallest in a year, driven by lower average loan sizes across both conventional and government loan types,\" Kan added. As mortgage rates fall, there is less demand for adjustable-rate loans. They do offer lower rates, but with higher risk, so they are less popular when fixed interest rates are lower. The ARM share of activity decreased to 6.3% of total applications.Mortgage rates have barely moved at all to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily, as there has been little economic data to influence them. That will change Wednesday with two labor market reports and ISM's service sector report set for release.\"Individually, none of these are as heavy hitting as Friday's forthcoming jobs report, but if they all sing a similar tune, it could definitely get rates moving (for better or worse),\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily. \"Specifically, if the data is stronger, it would likely push rates higher and vice versa.\"",

    "body": "A view of houses in the old town of Nuuk, Greenland, March 27, 2025.Leonhard Foeger | ReutersDonald Trump is interested in annexing Greenland, an Arctic island offering a wealth of untapped mineral resources. But as the U.S. president dialed up the rhetoric about America annexing the self-governing Danish territory, sparking a backlash from international leaders, a report detailed the challenges facing its economy.Published Tuesday, a report by Søren Bjerregaard, head of securities and balance of payments at Danmarks Nationalbank, warned that there were \"major challenges ahead\" for Greenland's economy. The Arctic island's economy — largely driven by the fishing industry — expanded by 0.8% in 2025 and is expected to grow a further 0.8% this year, down from 2% in 2022. According to the Danish central bank, the slowdown is likely to continue.\"The Greenlandic economy is slowing down, with modest growth and serious challenges for public finances,\" Bjerregaard wrote.\"This is partly because the expansion of infrastructure in the form of airports is nearing completion, and planned major projects in energy supply and other areas have not yet begun.\"He added that at the same time, vital shrimp stocks were declining, while public finances \"deteriorated surprisingly sharply in 2025.\" Part of the pressure on public finances was arising from a decrease in dividends from government-owned firms. \"Liquidity in the Greenland Treasury fell to a critically low level in the second half of the year,\" Bjerregaard said, noting that legislation set to be rolled out this year contains urgent fiscal tightening measures. \"More fiscal challenges lie ahead, with a declining and ageing population putting further pressure on the economy,\" he added.Greenland's population, which stood at 56,699 in the final quarter of 2025, is expected to shrink 20% by 2050, as the territory struggles to attract migrants to replace emigrating residents. Trump 'very serious' about acquiring GreenlandIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said he was \"very serious\" about acquiring the Arctic island. A day earlier, he told reporters that the U.S. needs Greenland to bolster its national security.He was speaking after Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro.Trump later told The Atlantic that America \"absolutely\" needs Greenland, with the president telling the magazine that countries aside from Venezuela could be subject to U.S. intervention.Trump has long floated the idea of taking Greenland. In early 2025, he said the U.S. would assume control \"one way or the other.\"Officials in Greenland, Denmark and across the European continent have rejected the notion that the U.S. can make any claim on Greenland.Read moreOn Monday, Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, rebuked parallels between the territory and Venezuela. \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland,\" Nielsen told a news conference. \"Our country is not really the right one to compare with Venezuela. We are a country that is democratic and has been democratic for many, many years.\"",

    "body": "An electric air taxi by Joby Aviation sits at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in New York City, Nov. 12, 2023.Roselle Chen | ReutersJoby Aviation on Wednesday said it bought a 700,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio, as the air taxi maker gears up to meet its production goals for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts, also known as eVTOLs.Joby agreed to purchase the facility from Capstone STS for $61.5 million, according to a filing.The company said the new location, its second in Ohio, more than doubles the size of its manufacturing footprint. The company also reiterated plans announced last year to more than double production capacity to four aircrafts a month by 2027.CEO JoeBen Bevirt said the facility will support future growth plans at Joby, and ties into efforts to revitalize the commercial and defense aerospace industries on U.S. soil.  \"The reindustrialization of Ohio has become central to Joby's story and with unmatched governmental and policy support, we're ready to make sure that the commercial and defense aircraft that define the future of flight are built right here in America,\" Bevirt said in a release announcing the news.Air taxi makers like Joby have scaled manufacturing in recent months, building up production facilities to support the burgeoning market and gain an edge over competitors. These companies are also racing for certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, which they need to start flying their aircrafts commercially.Read more CNBC tech newsThis climate startup is taking recycling to the next level, with shower water beerElon Musk's xAI raises $20 billion from investors including Nvidia, Cisco, FidelityMeta hires Microsoft exec, former Trump deputy as chief legal officerHuang says Nvidia seeing 'very high' Chinese customer demand for H200 AI chipswatch now",

    "body": "An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 departs Los Angeles International Airport en route to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Sept. 19, 2024.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesAlaska Airlines is buying more than 100 Boeing jets, a purchase that the carrier's fleet chief said will ensure it has locked in sought-after order slots through the middle of the next decade to expand. The order, Alaska's largest ever, announced Wednesday, includes 105 yet-to-be-certified Boeing 737 Max 10 jets. Alaska is also buying five 787-10 Dreamliners, using its previous purchase options for those long-haul jets as it charts international expansion.Shane Jones, who oversees Alaska Airlines' fleet, revenue products and real estate, told CNBC that the airline expects FAA certification of the Max 10 this year, with deliveries beginning in 2027. Alaska, which merged with Hawaiian Airlines in 2024, had previously ordered more than 40 Max 10 planes. The new order includes options for 35 more. Fifty-three of the planes in Wednesday's order are new, and 52 are from options the airline is exercising.Boeing has more than 6,000 aircraft on backorder, but Alaska's purchase plans are a vote of confidence in airplane maker, whose 737 factory 10 miles away from the carrier's headquarters gave Alaska a 737 Max 9 two years ago without key bolts installed in a door plug. That panel blew out of the plane on Jan. 5, 2024, as it climbed out of Portland, Oregon, stunning travelers, though there were no serious physical injuries.Read more CNBC airline newsWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentThe accident set Boeing back in production as it waded through another safety crisis during what was supposed to be its turnaround year in the wake of two deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.The 737 Max 10 has a shorter range than some other models but it can fit more passengers than smaller variants, a boost to carriers' unit costs on high-demand flights like cross-country routes.Under Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who replaced insider Dave Calhoun months after the accident, the plane maker has improved its production rate and quality, airline executives have said. It plans to ramp up production this year. The FAA must approve Boeing's Max production increases, a requirement following the door plug accident.Alaska's Jones told CNBC that the carrier's trust in Boeing is \"a part of this order.\" He also said it showed \"our confidence in the Max 10 certification and our confidence in Boeing and their turnaround and their ability to produce quality aircraft on time.\"Jones said about half of the new aircraft orders are for replacement, with the rest for growth. He declined to disclose how much the airline paid for the aircraft. Manufacturers often share list prices, though big customers generally receive discounts for large orders.",

    "body": "Signage for Bitcoin cryptocurrency in Hong Kong, Nov. 26, 2025.Lam Yik | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFollowing President Nicolás Maduro's deposition last weekend, all eyes are on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves. But there's another resource Maduro's regime is believed to have had in abundance — an asset that, if liquidated or seized, would have implications for global financial markets: bitcoin.Venezuela is likely sitting on sizable amounts of the cryptocurrency — a stash that could be worth billions of U.S. dollars, experts told CNBC. \"It's very fair to assume Venezuela had meaningful exposure to bitcoin,\" said Gui Gomes, founder and CEO of Latin America-based bitcoin firm OranjeBTC. \"Given that they were excluded from the global financial system, probably they had gold, bitcoin and some dollars under their mattress.\"Sanctions levied against Venezuela restricted the nation's access to financial markets. To work around this, the country likely experimented with cryptocurrencies, experts said. They noted that it's virtually impossible to ascertain the exact amount of bitcoin Venezuela may be sitting on, or where those holdings could be stored, due to the privacy features of the decentralized asset and its underlying technology. However, one thing is clear: If Maduro and his allies have tokens in their coffers, the assets might soon be on the move, they said. And whether those bitcoins are sold, confiscated or exchanged, cryptocurrency holders could feel the impact. Billions in bitcoin? Digital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold roughly $60 billion, citing unnamed sources that were not confirmed through blockchain analysis. Such a stash would put the regime among the biggest holders of the crypto in the world, alongside bitcoin treasury firm Strategy. Data provider Bitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela's holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth roughly $22 million. To reach this estimate they used data from a blockchain analytics firm that was cited by a media outlet.  Based on their rankings, it would the ninth largest pile of bitcoin held by a government entity.  All these estimates must be taken with a grain of salt. Many of the largest firms offering crypto custodial solutions, including digital asset bank Anchorage Digital and Fireblocks, are registered in the U.S. or allied nations, so Venezuela would have had to turn to more covert techniques to amass its shadow reserve, Haun Ventures general partner Diogo Mónica told CNBC. \"There are so many [solutions] for bitcoin off the shelf, it is actually very easy for you to meet the threshold of high security\" through those means, Mónica said. As a result, any bitcoin held by Venezuela is likely distributed across thousands of crypto wallets under the control of various generals and other members of Maduro's party, making it difficult to identify and track, according to OranjeBTC's Gomes.On-chain analysis can reveal transaction histories and balances of public addresses linked to hardware wallets, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. But those methods cannot offer conclusive insights into wallet owners' identities, making it difficult for cybercrime experts to identify which wallets belong to Venezuelan officials.That said, it's still probable that Venezuela could have amassed large amounts of bitcoin in recent years to navigate the consequences of its exclusion from global financial markets, Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, told CNBC. He noted that the country has a history of using unorthodox methods to convert and transfer its wealth, including by flying allies of Maduro to foreign locales to exchange tangible assets for more liquid funds.\"If they're willing to send a guy on a private jet with a ton of gold on board, it would make a lot of sense that they would also seek to utilize crypto assets for both store of wealth and also for cross-border trade,\" Fierman said. He declined to estimate the value of Venezuela's holdings.  The South American nation also has a long history of experimenting with cryptocurrencies, Fierman said. He cited the issuance in 2018 of a token called petro, which later failed and was sunsetted in 2024, as an example. Given its history with digital assets, it's also possible the Venezuelan government holds other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, including stablecoins, according to Fierman.However, bitcoin would likely be the favored asset as it is issued by an agnostic network and has no direct ties to the U.S. dollar, unlike most stablecoins, said Jorge Jraissati, president of the nonprofit Economic Inclusion Group. He added that some of the regime's bitcoins could have been acquired through local authorities' seizures of crypto miners' token rewards. In 2017, CNBC reported on Venezuelan authorities' efforts to curb crypto mining by arresting bitcoin miners and seizing their assets. That was before the nation completely outlawed the practice in 2024, citing energy concerns. Data from Hashrate index shows that Venezuela still accounted for about 0.6% of all hash rates, a measure of power used to mine tokens on the bitcoin blockchain as of 2025. What happens next?Assuming Venezuela holds bitcoin, speculation abounds on what happens next. One possibility is that the Maduro regime's holdings will go up for sale, according to Sebastian Pedro Bea, president and chief investment officer at ReserveOne.\"Anytime you have a chaotic regime change, the assets of that country become unstable, like people can just steal stuff,\" Bea said. \"I'm not suggesting that's likely, but it is more likely today than last week that, if they have bitcoin, some of that bitcoin could end up on exchange, or could end up being sold.\"That sell-off could dent bitcoin's price in the near term. Alternatively, the U.S. could seize Venezuela's bitcoin as part of its enforcement actions, according to Bea. \"Nothing is stopping the U.S. from doing more enforcement actions that go after bad actors [in Venezuela] who could happen to have a lot of bitcoin,\" Bea said. \"And when they do that, that bitcoin can go right to Treasury.\"Some cryptocurrency holders have speculated the Trump administration could confiscate some of Maduro and his allies' bitcoin, with the aim of creating a U.S. bitcoin reserve at no cost to taxpayers.U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve at no cost to taxpayers — a central tenet of his pro-crypto policy plans. However, critics and proponents alike have questioned the logistics of the proposal, including how bitcoin could be accumulated in a tax-neutral way.Chris Perkins, managing partner and president of investment firm CoinFund, said it's unclear whether the U.S. could legally use Venezuela's bitcoin to create its planned strategic reserve. However, such a scenario would ultimately be bullish for the asset, according to the executive. \"... To the extent that the Trump administration comes into possession of a significant amount of bitcoin, don't expect them to dump it into the market,\" said Perkins, who served as a U.S. marine. Whatever happens next, the U.S.' recent actions in Venezuela underscore the Trump administration's ability and willingness to wield its power to advance its policy objectives, which include promoting and advancing the digital assets industry, according to Bea. \"Crypto seems to be an unintended beneficiary, long term, of the [U.S. military intervention in Venezuela],\" Bea said.

This figure was later revised to 6.5% in May.Private consumption is expected to expand by 7%, down slightly from the previous year's growth of 7.2%. Meanwhile, government spending is projected to rise 5.2%, up from a 2.3% increase in the previous year.Indian exports to the U.S., its biggest trading partner, have been subject to 50% tariffs since August last year. While negotiations toward a trade agreement are ongoing, the prolonged tariffs are expected to weigh on economic momentum.Last month, the International Monetary Fund said India's real GDP is projected to grow 6.6% in fiscal 2026 before moderating to 6.2% in fiscal 2027, assuming a prolonged delay in a U.S.-India trade deal.Despite these risks, the Indian economy has been surprisingly resilient in the first half of fiscal 2026, growing faster than expected at 7.8% in the June quarter and 8.2% in the three months ending September. India's central bank last month revised the real GDP growth for fiscal 2026 to 7.3% from the earlier estimate of 6.8%, citing easing price pressures.The Reserve Bank of India has lowered its consumer price inflation forecast to 2.0%, from 2.6% for this fiscal year. That gave the central bank room to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%, even as it flagged weakness in some key economic indicators.",

Airlines offer elite loyalty program members perks — ranging from earlier boarding and a free checked bag to free upgrades to roomier cabins and airport lounge memberships — in exchange for lots of flights on the carrier and its partners, as well as co-branding credit card spending.Airlines in recent years have switched their loyalty program models to reward travelers' spending instead of simply how far they fly.American said it is also adding more perks for milestones in between earned status tiers, like two food and beverage coupons at the 15,000-point level or a subscription to The New York Times games or cooking platforms or the Times' sports publication, The Athletic. The first level of elite status, Gold, is awarded at 40,000 loyalty points.The carrier has been investing in new cabins and larger lounges and on Tuesday said it is starting to offer free in-flight Wi-Fi, a plan it announced last April.

Xny/star Max | Gc Images | Getty ImagesSeven U.S. service members were injured during Saturday's U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a Pentagon official told MS Now on Wednesday.Two of the seven are still recovering, while five have recovered from their injuries sustained in the operation dubbed \"Absolute Resolve.\"\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the official said.The official said an assessment of casualties on the ground was still ongoing and is being led by the U.S. intelligence community.Venezuelan officials previously told MS Now that more than 70 people were killed in the raid. Special operations forces from multiple service branches and more than 150 military aircraft were involved in the capture of Maduro.U.S. President Donald Trump said the military action was conducted in coordination with American law enforcement authorities, according to a post on Truth Social on Saturday.Cuba said on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed during the operation, adding that those individuals were carrying out missions for Cuba's armed forces and interior ministry. The statement was posted by Cuba's presidential office on Facebook.The U.S. strikes followed weeks of military buildup in the region and repeated threats by Trump against Maduro.The deposed leader appeared in a New York court on Monday, where he said he had been \"kidnapped\" with his wife by U.S. forces from his home in Caracas and described himself as a \"prisoner of war.\" He pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.— CNBC's Lim Hui Jie and MS Now's Julia Jester contributed to this report.watch now",

The board said it continued to believe the Paramount bid is \"inferior\" to a previously announced deal with Netflix to buy WBD's studio and streaming business for $72 billion. \"We have a signed merger agreement with Netflix, it's a compelling value, a clear path to closing and protections for our shareholders if something stops the close, whatever that might be,\" WBD board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber on \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday morning. In the days following the announcement of that deal, Paramount launched its hostile bid, taking directly to shareholders an offer of $30 per share, all cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its TV networks. WBD's board made an initial recommendation to reject the offer, and Paramount subsequently made another push for the coveted assets. In late December Paramount guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, as a clear response to questions raised by WBD's board. Di Piazza previously told CNBC that the board had concerns about the backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In an amended offer late last year, Paramount said Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. However, Paramount Skydance stopped short of upping the amount of its bid.  \"PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions,\" the WBD board said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday. \"The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its 'best and final' proposal,\" the board continued. In a Wednesday letter to members of the WBD board, Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said the board has \"made an error\" in not engaging with Paramount's revised bid. Pentwater is WBD's seventh largest shareholder.\"Paramount has offered a $30 per share that is economically superior, it is superior in terms of regulatory risk, and I understand the board has some legitimate issues with it, but those legitimate issues don't warrant giving Paramount the stiff arm and refusing to actually have a conversation,\" Halbower told Faber Wednesday morning. \"That's not how I want my board of directors to act.\"Halbower's letter argues that the board's reasons for not engaging with Paramount's bid were insufficient and that the board has \"breached its fiduciary obligations\" to its shareholders.\"We are a small voice, but I think it's important for the board to at least hear our voice as the seventh largest shareholder, because I think what they are doing is wrong,\" Halbower said on CNBC. \"If Paramount goes away, then it is a lost opportunity.\"watch nowParamount first showed interest in acquiring all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets in September. The company made three takeover offers before Warner Bros. Discovery kicked off a formal sale process, inviting other bidders into the fold. Representatives for Paramount didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Netflix issued its own statement welcoming the WBD board's recommendation and noting it has been engaging with the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission on antitrust concerns surrounding the merger. \"The WBD Board remains fully supportive of and continues to recommend Netflix's merger agreement, recognizing it as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry,\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in the statement.

    "body": "Demonstrators hold a large Venezuelan flag outside the National Assembly, on the day Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was formally sworn in as the country's interim president, as U.S.-deposed President Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court after the Trump administration removed him from power, in Caracas, Venezuela Jan. 5, 2026.Maxwell Briceno | ReutersVenezuela's long-defaulted bonds are suddenly one of the hottest trades in emerging markets.Prices on the country's benchmark notes due in October 2026 have surged to about 43 cents on the dollar, more than doubling since August. The rally comes as traders reassess recovery prospects on the distressed securities following the surprise removal of President Nicolas Maduro and a shift in U.S. policy that has opened the door to a potential restructuring of the nation's debt.Investors are betting that a faster-than-expected political transition along with a clearer path to asset recovery could unlock value that has been frozen for nearly a decade. Venezuela fell into default in late 2017 after failing to make payments on overseas bonds issued by both the government and its state-owned oil producer PDVSA. Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price are among the holders that own significant amounts of these defaulted bonds, according to reports.Donato Guarino, an emerging-market strategist at Citi, said uncertainties remain particularly given lingering questions about the new government's political alignment with Washington.\"To the Trump administration, it's key to extract the oil reserves the Venezuela has at the moment. That means that the GDP of Venezuela will go higher. That means that the ability to pay bondholders will be higher,\" Guarino told CNBC. \"However, in the short term, you may see some risks because what Trump did is a big gamble... there is a question of loyalty of the current new president towards Trump.\"Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. Big risk remainsBarclays upgraded Venezuela bonds to market weight after rapidly unfolding political developments altered its outlook.The Wall Street firm also cautioned that the scale and complexity of Venezuela's debt overhang could cap upside from here. Venezuela and PDVSA together have $56.5 billion of unsecured eurobonds outstanding, Barclays said. Including past-due interest, total bondholder claims rise to $98.3 billion, or roughly 119% of GDP, based on the IMF's 2025 GDP projection.The bank said recovery values could vary widely, noting that Venezuela's economy is now about 30% smaller and oil production has nearly halved over the past eight years. As a result, ultimate recoveries will depend heavily on how quickly the economy and oil sector can rebound in the years ahead.Jeffrey Sherman, deputy chief investment officer at DoubleLine, believes the rally may be running ahead of reality. \"There's still a lot of risks there. you have this kind of continuation right now of the leadership there,\" Sherman said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" \"We'll see how that transitions are talking about elections and things. So again, I think it's way too early to get too excited about that, especially as a debt investor.\"watch nowThe recent developments in Venezuela could also prove a major win for Elliott Investment Management, the firm founded by billionaire investor Paul Singer. Less than two months ago, the investor, known for striking lucrative deals in high-risk markets, won U.S. approval for a $6 billion bid for Citgo Petroleum, the refining firm owned by state-run PDVSA.— With assistance from Gina Francolla",

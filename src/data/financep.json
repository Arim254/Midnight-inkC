    "body": "The European Commission has told Meta it intends to impose \"interim measures\" to stop the tech giant from excluding third-party AI assistants from WhatsApp.On Monday, the EU informed the company that its preliminary view was that it had \"breached\" EU antitrust rules. The investigation is still ongoing, and measures are subject to Meta's reply and rights of defense, the Commission said.The bloc's Commissioner for Competition, Teresa Ribera, said it would prevent \"dominant tech companies to illegally leverage their dominance to give themselves an unfair advantage\" to protect \"effective competition.\"\"AI markets are developing at rapid pace, so we also need to be swift in our action. That is why we are considering quickly imposing interim measures on Meta, to preserve access for competitors to WhatsApp, while the investigation is ongoing, and avoid Meta's new policy irreparably harming competition in Europe,\" she added.In October, Meta announced an update to its WhatsApp Business Solution Terms, \"effectively\" banning third-party general-purpose AI assistants from the application, the Commission said. The policy came into effect in January.A Commission spokesperson told CNBC that interim measures would involve it asking Meta to maintain third-party AI assistants' access to WhatsApp under the terms before the policy change, while its investigation.\"The facts are that there is no reason for the EU to intervene in the WhatsApp Business API,\" a Meta spokesperson said.\"There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating systems, devices, websites, and industry partnerships. The Commission's logic incorrectly assumes the WhatsApp Business API is a key distribution channel for these chatbots,\" they added.U.S. big tech companies were hit with a slew of fines in 2025 for breaching EU rules.In April, Apple was fined 500 million euros after being found to have breached anti-steering obligations.The same month, Meta was hit with a 200 million euros fine for breaching obligations to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.In September, the Commission fined Google 2.95 billion euros for breaching antitrust rules around online advertising.",

    "body": "watch nowAt America's oldest bank, 134 new workers don't sleep or take sick days. They don't even have names.They're what BNY calls \"digital employees.\" They work side by side with humans. They have unique roles and are evaluated by how well they do them. Some of their jobs were done by people last year.\"The digital employee works 24/7, which is obviously very different to our human counterparts,\" said Rachel Lewis, who oversees nine digital employees in addition to thousands of humans as head of payment operations for BNY.  \"It's really focused on very specific repetitive tasks that allow our human employees to do much more human, intense, interesting-type roles.\"BNY employs 48,100 humans, down from about 53,400 in 2023, according to a recent earnings presentation. CFO Dermot McDonogh was asked on the firm's fourth-quarter analyst call last month what the 134 digital employees mean for cost savings at the firm. \"Our head count has trended down a little bit, but that's not really anything to do with AI yet,\" McDonogh said. \"We talk about, internally, AI is unlocking capacity. We don't think about it in the narrow definition of efficiency. It's all about growing with clients, increasing revenues and optimizing the potential for our employees.\" Across Wall Street, analysts and investors are starting to ask more questions about how the industry's expenses on AI will translate into higher efficiencies and greater returns. BNY spent $3.8 billion on technology in 2025, or about 19% of its revenue. That's the highest proportion among its large-bank peers, according to data collated by CNBC.JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, BNY\"There's an AI arms race. The banks are part of that, said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. \"But you don't define success by who spends the most. You define success by who has the best results.\"\"It's a lot of 'spraying and praying' when it comes to spending on tech, generally,\" he said. However, BNY has been identified as one of the companies that could see the biggest benefits from AI. Goldman Sachs' research team screened the Russell 1000 for potential productivity improvements, based on labor costs and wage exposure to AI automation. The firm ranked BNY toward the top of that list, saying the bank could see a potential 19% boost to earnings per share. But in several conversations CNBC had with executives at BNY, they've been steadfast that the multitude of technology investments won't come at the expense of human employees.\"I wouldn't think about it that way,\" said Michelle O'Reilly, BNY global head of talent. \"I would think about it more as unlocking that productivity – enabling all employees to be productive.\"While the company is building more digital employees, it's also upskilling the human ones. Shortly after ChatGPT was released in late 2022, BNY set up its AI Hub. \"That's when we really doubled down and realized that this would be transformational for the bank,\" said Leigh-Ann Russell, BNY's chief information officer and global head of engineering. \"Our biggest focus initially was enablement – getting some training rolled out to every one of our employees at the bank.\"BNY built a platform it calls Eliza, which pulls in a variety of open-source, commercially available models that are integrated with the firm's internal data and compliance. Almost all of BNY's workforce has completed a 10-hour training for Eliza, and thousands more have taken it a step further through a multi-day AI bootcamp that can help non-engineers find creative ways to automate parts of their jobs. The name \"Eliza\" is a tribute to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, the wife of the bank's founder and America's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton. \"Democratization of this technology is one of our sweet spots on how we feel like we've been successful so far,\" Russell said. \"I have this juxtaposition of this original history of this amazing 241-year institution and being at the forefront of AI, and I think that's just a lovely reminder of technology over the centuries.\"",

    "body": "Still life of the new Wegovy semaglutide tablets on a white background. Its a prescription medicine used with a reduced calorie diet and .and physical activity.Michael Siluk | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesThe Food and Drug Administration said Novo Nordisk's TV advertisement for its newly launched Wegovy pill for obesity included \"false or misleading\" claims about the medicine's abilities and benefits to patients.In a letter to Novo dated Feb. 5, the FDA said the ad misbrands the oral drug, making its distribution a violation of federal law. The agency requested that the drugmaker take immediate action to address the violations, which could include ceasing all ads containing misleading claims. In a statement Monday, Novo Nordisk confirmed that it received the letter and clarified that the ad has been running since the pill's launch, but is not the company's Super Bowl spot. \"We take all regulatory feedback seriously and are in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns regarding the advertisement's presentation,\" Liz Skrbkova, Novo's head of U.S. media and stakeholder relations, said in the statement. It adds to the mounting hurdles the Danish drugmaker is facing as it scrambles to win back market share from chief rival Eli Lilly and cheaper compounded copycats in the booming GLP-1 market. The company's Wegovy pill is key to those efforts. It was the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity to enter the market in January, and Novo last week said more than 170,000 American patients are already taking the drug. Bloomberg first reported on the FDA letter on Monday. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsIn the letter, the FDA said Novo's ad misleadingly suggests its pill offers superior benefits to other approved GLP-1 weight loss drugs. The agency said phrases used in the spot, including \"live lighter\" and \"a way forward,\" imply greater weight loss than other treatments and added benefits beyond that, despite no evidence to support those claims. The ad's statements \"misleadingly imply benefits beyond physical weight loss such as emotional relief, reduced psychological burden, hope, or direction for patients' lives, positioning the drug as a solution to broader life challenges rather than a treatment for a specific condition, when this has also not been demonstrated,\" the FDA said in the letter. The FDA also flagged the ad for failing to properly present risk information in both audio and text, a requirement for television drug advertising. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk sued Hims & Hers, asking the court to stop the telehealth company from mass marketing compounded versions of its Wegovy pill and injections. ",

    "body": "TOPSHOT - Media tycoon Jimmy Lai (R) is escorted into a Hong Kong Correctional Services van outside the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong on February 1, 2021, after being ordered to remain in jail while judges consider his fresh bail application, the first major legal challenge to a sweeping national security law Beijing imposed on the city last year. Str | Afp | Getty Images Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai on Monday was sentenced to 20 years in prison in one of the most prominent prosecutions under a China-imposed national security law that has reshaped the city's political landscape since 2020. \"Having stepped back and taking a global view of the total sentence for Lai's serious and grave criminal conduct ... we are satisfied that the total sentence for Lai in the present case should be 20 years' imprisonment,\" the city's High Court said in its ruling. Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, was convicted in December for collusion with foreign forces, endangering national security, and conspiracy to publish seditious materials. The 78-year-old has been in detention for more than five years while serving a separate prison term on fraud charges. The 20-year sentence was the longest handed out under the national security law introduced in 2020, surpassing the 10-year term given to activist Benny Tai, a former law professor who was convicted of conspiring to subvert state power, in November 2024. \"A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust,\" said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Lai was among the first prominent figures arrested in August 2020 under the security law that Beijing implemented in the Chinese special administrative region, following widespread pro-democracy protests in 2019. The newspaper ceased operations in June 2021 after police arrested more company employees and froze its assets, ending a 26-year run.  Lai's case has drawn international criticism, and is seen as a sign of shrinking space for dissent in what was once viewed as the bastion of press freedom in Asia.  U.S. President Donald Trump in December expressed sympathy for Lai's conviction, saying that he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to consider his release, but stopped short of taking new action to pressure Beijing.  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the case with Xi during his visit to Beijing last month, calling for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. \"Those discussions will continue, and the foreign secretary is in touch with Mr Lai's family,\" Starmer told the U.K. parliament after his trip.   watch nowIn a statement Monday, Taiwan's government called the sentence \"harsh\" and an act of \"trampling on freedom of speech and the press,\" while denying people's basic right to \"hold those in power accountable.\"  Hong Kong authorities have maintained the case was not targeted at curbing press freedom, saying that Lai used news reporting as a pretext to commit acts that threatened China and Hong Kong's security.Prosecutors accused Lai of conspiring with six former Apple Daily staffers, two activists and others to lobby foreign governments to impose sanctions and blockades or engage in hostile activities in Hong Kong. Lai, a vocal critic of the Chinese government, had pleaded not guilty to two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials. — CNBC's Hikmah Md Ali and Elaine Yu contrbuted to the report.

    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications and meetings involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech leaders named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those four have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City. The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Hoffman.Dominik Bindl | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeanwhile, a 2015 email from Epstein mentioned a dinner Hoffman hosted in Palo Alto, attended by Zuckerberg, Musk, Thiel, and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden.Hoffman connected Zuckerberg and Epstein via email after the event.  In response to an inquiry, Meta directed CNBC to a 2019 statement from a spokesperson, which stated that Zuckerberg did not communicate with Epstein again after the dinner.Hoffman did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks.DatabricksDatabricks said Monday it has raised $5 billion in funding and $2 billion in new debt capacity at a $134 billion valuation. The privately held data analytics software company also said that its annualized revenue exceeded $5.4 billion for the January quarter, up 65% year over year, while delivering free cash flow over the past year. That type of performance might whet the appetites of public market investors, who have not seen many new issuances of technology companies with high growth rates. Databricks is prepared to go public \"when the time is right,\" co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC in an interview. This year is shaping up to potentially feature notable tech IPOs. Fast-growing artificial intelligence labs Anthropic and OpenAI are also considering 2026 initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk said in December that his rocket company SpaceX could also go public this year.Like many other companies, Databricks is generating revenue from AI. The company helps its clients connect their data with AI models to launch custom agents, in addition to providing tools for storing, processing and querying data. AI products now generate $1.4 billion in annualized revenue, Databricks said in a statement. The pace of Databricks' overall expansion is accelerating — in June, the company forecast 50% growth.The company said in December that it was raising more than $4 billion in the round at a valuation of $134 billion. \"We weren't sure we're going to actually be able to raise all of the five,\" said Ghodsi, adding that there was heavy interest in recent weeks. He said it can take months for venture capital to reflect major changes in equity markets. Goldman Sachs, Glade Brook Capital, Morgan Stanley, Neuberger Berman and the Qatar Investment Authority are among the investors in the new round. JPMorgan led the debt round, and now Databricks has billions in cash on hand.\"If this correction hasn't bottomed out yet, and it's just going to continue, we're just going to continue as a private company,\" Ghodsi said.Databricks is now larger than rival Snowflake, which reported $1.21 billion in revenue in the October quarter. Snowflake's market cap stands at about $58 billion. With the wide release of its Lakebase database last week, Databricks has expanded its market, challenging incumbents such as Oracle and SAP.Oracle and Snowflake shares both fell about 13% last week as software stocks took a step down across the market. That happened due to investors worrying that open-source plugins for Anthropic's Claude Cowork AI-powered productivity tool might pose new competitive challenges for public software companies. \"The correction is an overreaction, and you're going to see all these companies be around, and nobody's getting rid of them anytime soon,\" Ghodsi said. \"Their moat is shrinking.\"Founded in 2013, Databricks ranked No. 3 on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.— CNBC's Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.WATCH: Trading the tech takedown with Altimeter's Brad Gerstnerwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowTarget said Monday that it's stepping up store staffing, but eliminating about 500 jobs in distribution centers and regional offices as it tries to win back shoppers who have complained about sloppier shelves, out-of-stock items and longer checkout lines.In an internal employee memo obtained by CNBC, the big-box retailer said it's making changes to the way it runs and oversees stores to improve the customer experience, a top goal of the company's new CEO Michael Fiddelke. To do that, Target said it will reduce the number of store districts — the geographic areas that its nearly 2,000 stores are broken into, which have dedicated staffing — and put money toward more hours for frontline store employees.As part of the changes, Target is laying off around 500 people, including about 100 at the store district level and about 400 across its supply chain sites, the internal email said.\"This change also fuels our ability to put significantly more payroll in our stores – primarily in additional labor and hours where needed most, but also in new guest experience training for every team member at every store,\" the email said. The email was written by Adrienne Costanzo, chief stores officer, and Gretchen McCarthy, chief supply chain and logistics officer, and sent to Target employees across its headquarters and store field teams on Monday afternoon.A Target spokesperson declined to specify the amount of additional investment planned for Target stores, but said the announcement will not change starting wages for store workers, which range from $15 to $24 per hour depending on the location. Read moreFor Target, the organizational shift marks one of the first changes under Fiddelke, formerly the company's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, who stepped into the top job on Feb. 1. Fiddelke took the helm as the company aims to get back to growth. Its annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and it cut 1,800 corporate roles last year in its first major layoff in a decade. Customers, vendors and investors say the company had gotten weaker in some of the key areas where it used to stand out. For example, some shoppers said Target had lost its edge with attentive customer service and trendy, fashion-forward merchandise that earned the company its \"Tarzhay\" nickname.The company has also faced backlash and boycotts from customers over a string of political and social stances over the past few years, including its decision to sell and then pull some Pride Month merchandise, its embrace of and reversal of major diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and most recently, for not speaking out against the surge of immigration enforcement in its hometown of Minneapolis. Along with Target's self-inflicted struggles, the company has faced stiffer competition from peers like Walmart and a tougher economic backdrop. Consumers have been more selective in recent years about discretionary purchases and impulse items — Target's sweet spot — while paying more for necessities like groceries and rent. In an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters in October, Fiddelke said his leading priorities as CEO would be restoring Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology to speed along the business.Yet he added that Target needs to simplify an operation that's become more complicated for store managers and store employees in recent years as they not only stock shelves, but pick orders for curbside pickup or pack up cardboard boxes heading to customers' homes.\"If you're a store manager now, yes, you're supporting your in-store guest and you're also running a fulfillment business that's gotten pretty big,\" he said in the October interview. \"And I think we're just now fully appreciating, 'All right, we've got to make sure that we're doing both really well and it's more complex than it used to be.'\"Last year, the company made another store-related change to try to clean up and smooth over its operations. Almost all of Target's online orders are fulfilled in stores, which has taken up more of employees' time and stores' backrooms. In response, the company shook up its online strategy, designating some stores as locations where employees pick and pack online orders to ship to customers' homes and dropping that altogether at other locations.Target is expected to share more details about its turnaround strategy, along with its holiday-quarter results and full-year forecast, on March 3. It will host an event for investors at its Minneapolis headquarters. ",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel in the island nation due to fuel shortages after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil.Cuba's leadership said Sunday that the country will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, which cited two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected.Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat,\" which required a national emergency declaration. Read moreThe U.S. president said Cuba's ties to countries including China, Russia and Iran, human rights violations and communist leadership destabilize the region \"through migration and violence.\" As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provide any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. Russia: Fuel situation in Cuba is 'critical'Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was \"truly critical\" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We know this. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.Pedestrians walk past the Habana Libre hotel, formerly the Habana Hilton, in Havana on Feb. 2, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the \"strongest possible terms.\"In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to \"blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba.\"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her government would aim to send humanitarian aid to Cuba from Monday, adding that the country is working to find a diplomatic solution to resume oil shipments to the Caribbean island.Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration.watch now",

    "body": "A real estate project under construction along the ancient Huai River in Huai'an City, Jiangsu Province, China on January 29, 2026.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBEIJING — S&P Global Ratings has lowered its forecast for China property sales this year, barely two months into 2026.The firm said Sunday that primary real estate sales will likely drop by 10% to 14% this year, worse than the 5% to 8% decline for 2026 sales predicted back in October.\"This is a downturn so entrenched that only the government has capacity to absorb the excess inventory,\" the analysts said in a note. They added that the state could buy more unsold property to create affordable housing, but that so far these efforts have been piecemeal.China's property market, once accounting for more than a quarter of the economy, has seen its annual sales volume halve in just four years. Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth sparked the initial slump, while consumer demand for homes has yet to pick up.Economists have long warned of overbuilding in China's property market. But developers have only kept up construction despite the sales slump, leading to a sixth-straight year of completed, unsold new housing, according to the ratings agency.\"China's glut of primary housing is keeping a property market recovery out of reach,\" the S&P analysts said, noting the oversupply pressures prices to fall by another 2% to 4% this year, following a similar decline last year.watch now\"Falling prices erode homebuyers' confidence,\" S&P's report said. \"It's a vicious cycle with no easy escape.\"What's particularly concerning, S&P said, is that the price decline in China's biggest cities worsened in the fourth quarter of last year. \"We previously viewed these markets as healthy, and as the likely starting place of any national property recovery,\" the report said.The cities of Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen reported home price declines last year of at least 3%, the report said, noting Shanghai was the only major city to report an increase, up 5.7% in 2025 from 2024.Getting worseChina's property slump progressively worsened throughout 2025.In May, S&P predicted a 3% decline in sales of new homes, only to revise that in October to an 8% drop. Sales ended up falling by 12.6% to 8.4 trillion yuan ($1.21 trillion) — less than half the annual sales of 18.2 trillion yuan seen in 2021.That's ramping up the pressure on China's struggling real-estate developers.If sales end up falling 10 percentage points below S&P's base case for this year and next, four of the 10 Chinese developers that the company rates could see downward rating pressure, the analysts said.That excludes China Vanke, once one of the country's largest developers, which, late last year, asked to delay repayment on some of its debt. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChinese authorities have yet to release significant new support for real estate, preferring to double down on efforts to develop advanced technologies.Last month, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said that China's push into high-tech industries isn't large enough to offset the country's property slump, leaving the economy more reliant on exports for growth and more exposed to trade tensions.Top policymakers are set to release economic goals for the year at a parliamentary meeting next month.",

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday endorsed Nexstar Media's proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna, just months after criticizing the deal.\"We need more competition against THE ENEMY, the Fake News National TV Networks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"Letting Good Deals get done like Nexstar - Tegna will help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level. Those that are opposed don't fully understand how good the concept of this Deal is for them, but they will in the future. GET THAT DEAL DONE!\"Under the agreement, Nexstar, which owns or partners with over 200 stations, would add Tegna's 64 stations — covering roughly 80% of the country. The deal, announced in August 2025, was expected to close in the second half of 2026. Trump's backing of the Nexstar-Tegna deal marks an abrupt turnaround. In a Truth Social post in November, Trump railed against the Nexstar-Tegna deal and the potential for more industry consolidation.\"If this would also allow the Radical Left Networks to 'enlarge,' I would not be happy,\" Trump wrote. \"ABC & NBC, in particular, are a disaster - A VIRTUAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. They should be viewed as an illegal campaign to the Radical Left. NO EXPANSION OF THE FAKE NEWS NETWORKS. If anything, make them SMALLER!\"Nexstar, Tegna and the White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The proposed Nexstar-Tegna deal is part of a string of recent media consolidation efforts as cord-cutting threatens the industry.\"We believe that broadcast news is essential to this country and a free democracy, independent local news, and that broadcast TV is basically the last bastion of local news at the local level, and our goal is to become a bigger company and hopefully be able to compete on a level playing field with Big Tech that is pervasive in all aspects of media,\" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook told CNBC after the deal announcement. watch nowCurrently, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits a company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households to foster competition. For Nexstar's deal to go through, the FCC would have to lift that rule.\"We are focused on achieving deregulation, and we continue to advocate for the elimination of the antiquated constraints on local television ownership as the best solution to level the competitive playing field for all media,\" Sook said in a November release when requesting approval for the Tegna deal.In September, Nexstar was the first media company to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the late-night talk show's host made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

    "body": "US' Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick (R) gestures on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 21, 2026. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesThe White House on Monday expressed confidence in Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after several lawmakers called for him to resign or be ousted. \"President Trump has assembled the best and most transformative cabinet in modern history,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an email. \"The entire Trump administration, including Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce, remains focused on delivering for the American people.\"Three members of Congress since Sunday called on Lutnick to resign amid revelations that his business and personal dealings with deceased sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein were more extensive than previously known.Lutnick \"lied to the country about his ties to Epstein,\" Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., wrote in an X post Monday morning.\"Now we learned that they were in business together,\" Schiff wrote. \"He has no business being our Commerce Secretary. He should resign.\"Schiff made his statement one day after Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., urged Lutnick to step down in light of The New York Times' report that the Trump administration official interacted \"regularly\" with Epstein, according to the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice. Massie was the lead Republican on the Epstein Files Transparency Act that compelled the release of the records relating to the notorious sex offender.\"He should just resign,\" Massie said on CNN's \"Inside Politics Sunday.\" \"Howard Lutnick clearly went to the island if we believe what's in these files; he was in business with Jeffrey Epstein, and this was many years after Jeffrey Epstein was convicted.\" Massie added, \"He's got a lot to answer for, but really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign.\"Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, took it a step further, calling on Lutnick to resign — or be fired.\"It's now clear that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been lying about his relationship with Epstein. He said he had no interactions with Epstein after 2005, yet we now know they were in business together,\" he wrote in a post late Sunday on X. \"Lutnick must resign or be fired. And he must answer our questions.\"Massie also noted that several British officials have been toppled over appearances in the Epstein files. Morgan McSweeney, chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, resigned on Sunday over his role in appointing ousted U.S. Ambassador Peter Mandelson. Mandelson was also named in the Epstein files.Lutnick's dealings with Epstein have come under increased scrutiny as dozens of public figures have been named in the files, which the DOJ has been releasing after a law was signed compelling their disclosure. The former chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald said on the podcast \"Pod Force One\" last year that he swore off interactions with Epstein after an initial encounter in 2005. The Times' analysis of the Epstein files, however, found that Lutnick and Epstein were in touch for years after the first meeting in 2005. It was previously reported that Epstein had invited Lutnick to his private island in the Caribbean and that Lutnick had been communicating with Epstein about construction happening across the street from their homes. The two also had drinks in 2011, the files revealed. The Times report also includes new details, including that Epstein's lawyer obtained the resume of Lutnick's nanny and that Epstein donated $50,000 to an event honoring Lutnick. Epstein and Lutnick also invested in the now-defunct company AdFin Solutions, according to the Times report. A Commerce Department spokesperson in an email to CNBC said Lutnick had \"very limited interactions\" with Epstein, and called the report a \"failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments.\"",

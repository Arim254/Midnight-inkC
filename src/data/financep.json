    "body": "Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the December quarter.Sheldon Cooper | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIndia's largest business group, Reliance Industries, has been battling geopolitical headwinds in its oil refining and, reportedly, in one of its new energy ventures. But those are not the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's biggest worries. The slowdown in its retail business, the group's third largest vertical, has had analysts reduce earnings estimates and cut stock target price, even as they maintain a buy rating on Reliance shares.Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the last quarter, raising doubts over its ability to deliver high growth.\"We are confident of delivering 20%+ plus CAGR [compound annual growth rate] in retail revenues over the next three years,\" Isha Ambani, who heads the retail business, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting last year.     Macquarie Capital has removed Reliance from its Asia Marquee list. Reliance Retail \"is a key swing factor\" in the group's sum-of-the-parts valuation due to the slowdown in its growth momentum, the global brokerage said in a report on Monday.Citi has cut its target price to 1,815 rupees ($19.9) per share from 1,860 rupees while UBS has lowered it to 1,790 rupees from 1,820 rupees. UBS was expecting the retail business to grow 10% on year in the December quarter.Just ahead of the festive season, in September, the Indian government slashed goods and service tax rates in order to spur domestic consumption. But the pick up in demand has been uneven across segments with sales of gold and cars increasing in the December quarter while fashion and consumer staples reported softer growth.\"We don't see any incremental near-term catalyst for consumer demand and go into 2026 with somber expectations. While we hope for a delayed impact of the stimulus measures, we expect only a gradual recovery at best, not a dramatic rebound,\" Bernstein said in a note earlier this week. Reliance Retail peers such as Avenue Supermarkets and Tata Group's Trent have also reported slower growth in the December quarter. Reliance has said festive season demand last year was split across second and third quarters, resulting in softer growth numbers. Reliance Retail has also argued that its December quarter results are not comparable year on year as its consumer staples business was demerged and now is a direct subsidy of Reliance Industries.  The gross revenue of consumer staples business was 50.65 billion rupees ($556.8 million)  in the December quarter, or roughly 5% of Reliance Retail's revenue of 976 billion rupee. Brokerages do not see the December quarter results as blip in the company's growth, but more of a secular downtrend. Citi on Monday pared its estimates for Reliance's consolidated EBITDA, from financial year 2026 to 2028 by 1%-2%, citing \"moderation\" in the retail business.Reliance Industries' shares have lost nearly 5% since its earnings were announced, even though the company's core oil refining business appears to be navigating well a tough business environment and its large telecom business reported steady growth.   Weathering headwindsReliance had to cut back on imports of cheap Russian oil as the U.S. imposed sanctions on oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil, one of which had a long-term supply contract with the Indian firm.The company has been one of the largest consumers of Russian crude oil, which accounted for 40%-45% of its crude mix at its peak, said Pankaj Srivastava, senior vice president of commodity markets-oil at Rystad Energy.EBITDA for oil-to-chemicals business, which includes refining and petrochemicals, rose 15% year on year and as \"refining cracks [margins] strength more than offset lower Russian crude intake, higher freight rates and petchem weakness,\" Goldman Sachs said in a report on Monday. Geopolitical concerns appear to have also weighed on the company's new energy business. A report from Bloomberg last week claimed that the company's plans of setting up a battery storage plant with an annual capacity of 40 gigawatt were put on hold. The report claimed that the Indian company was unable to procure technology from China owing to Beijing's curbs on technology transfer.During its earnings call the company denied any delays in the project. Karan Suri, senior vice president of new energy business, said the company was \"fast progressing on setting up our 40 gigawatt battery storage plant and the commissioning will happen over \"next few quarters.\"Untouched by domestic consumption worries or geopolitical tensions, the telecom business of Reliance, continued to deliver a steady performance, in line with expectations of brokerages such as UBS and Citi.The business, which is looking to list this year, reported a 12.7% year on year rise in its revenue and 16.4% rise in EBITDA. It added 8.9 million customers in the quarter taking its total subscriber base to 515 million. ",

    "body": "Homes under construction in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2025. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage refinancing jumped sharply higher for the second straight week, as interest rates fell further, but that boom may be about to bust. Interest rates are now moving much higher.Last week, applications to refinance a home loan rose 20% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Applications were 183% higher than the same week one year ago. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.16% from 6.18%, with points decreasing to 0.54 from 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the lowest rate since September 2024.\"Mortgage rates declined further last week, driving another big week for refinance applications, which saw the strongest level of activity since September 2025,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist. \"These lower rates prompted greater refinance activity from conventional and VA refinance borrowers, with increases of 29 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Refinance applications accounted for more than 60 percent of applications, and the average loan size also moved higher.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Rates initially dropped the week before last, after President Donald Trump said he would make mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy $200 billion of mortgage-backed bonds. Rates only fell 9 basis points across the two weeks, but the focus on it in the news may have caused an outsized reaction. The 30-year fixed was 86 basis points lower year-over-year.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 5% for the week and were 18% higher than the same week one year ago. Homebuyers are still contending with high home prices and continued uncertainty in the broader economy. There are more homes available for sale, but affordability, despite slightly lower rates, is still a major impediment. Interest rates moved much higher to start this week, as bond markets sold off following the Trump's threats of new tariffs and escalating tensions over Greenland. The average rate on the 30-year fixed jumped 14 basis points higher according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. \"This matches the level seen the day before the announcement of the administration's $200 billion mortgage bond buying plans. The last time rates were higher was December 23rd,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"In light of that announcement, why aren't mortgage rates doing better? Simply put, the market has already reacted to that news to the extent allowed by its transparency.\"",

    "body": "Algi Febri Sugita | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix said on Tuesday it had reached 325 million global paid subscribers, a new milestone for the streaming giant that last reported membership numbers a year ago. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly beat Wall Street estimates. Here's how Netflix performed for the period ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 55 cents, estimatedRevenue: $12.05 billion vs $11.97 billion, estimatedNet income for the fourth quarter was $2.42 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.87 billion, or 43 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. Netflix said revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing and increased advertising revenue. In recent years Netflix has been focused on growing its ad-supported membership tier. Netflix launched its ad-supported option in late 2022. On Tuesday, it said 2025 ad revenue grew by more than 2.5-times from 2024 to over $1.5 billion.The company said it expects 2026 overall revenue to range between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, due to increases in membership and pricing, as well as \"a projected rough doubling of ad revenue in 2026\" compared to the prior year. On Tuesday's earnings call with investors, Netflix leaders noted what they described as heated competition among industry peers when it comes to gaining subscribers and growing profitability. \"Looking ahead to '26 we're focused on improving the core business, you know, and we do that by increasing the variety and quality of our series and films,\" said co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Still, Netflix's stock was down more than 4% in after-market trading on Tuesday. Netflix's report drew comparisons to a Wall Street Journal report from April that outlined ambitious internal financial targets at the streamer. By those lofty standards, Netflix's growth underwhelmed. But co-CEO Greg Peters said Tuesday the internal targets were considered \"long-term aspirations\" and not to be confused with a forecast. \"Having said that, those goals were based on organic process,\" Peters added, noting they didn't take into account the impact of mergers and acquisitions. WBD deal updateNetflix's quarterly report comes against the backdrop of its proposed transaction of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and film studio assets. The company announcement in December that it had agreed to acquire streamer HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per WBD share, or an equity value of $72 billion.Earlier on Tuesday Netflix amended its offer to be all-cash. The company said Tuesday it would pause share repurchases to fund the acquisition. Netflix said in its letter to shareholders that it believes the transaction will \"allow us to accelerate our business strategy.\" Netflix said Warner Bros.' library, development and intellectual property will allow it to boost its content selection for members and that HBO Max will help to \"offer more personalized and flexible subscription options.\" However, the proposed acquisition came as a shock to the market as the streaming giant has long stayed away from industry consolidation and mega deals. Since October, when Netflix was first rumored to be interested in the assets, the company's stock has dropped nearly 30%.And the potential acquisition has not been without its bumps. Soon after announcing the deal with Netflix, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile effort to buy all of WBD. Lawmakers and industry insiders have also raised questions about whether the Netflix deal could win necessary regulatory approval. \"We're working really hard to close the acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, which we see as a strategic accelerant,\" Sarandos said on Tuesday's call. \"And we're doing all this while we're driving and sustaining healthy growth.\"Netflix has started the regulatory process, Sarandos said, adding he is confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer, ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\" The company has repeatedly argued the combination would preserve jobs during a time of heavy layoffs across media. On Tuesday, Sarandos said the Warner Bros. assets would bring the addition of businesses that don't already exist for Netflix. \"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"Sarandos and Peters both discussed the high level of competition in the media industry, which they said spans various platforms — from traditional TV to social media platforms like YouTube. Proving that Netflix is a small part of an expansive competitive landscape is likely to be key to Netflix's argument to antitrust regulators, CNBC previously reported. ",

    "body": "A shopper browses fruit and vegetables for sale at an indoor market in Sheffield, UK. The OECD recently predicted that the UK will experience the highest inflation among all advanced economies this year.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.K. inflation rate rose to 3.4% in December, above forecasts of 3.3% from economists polled by Reuters.The inflation rate had cooled sharply to 3.2% in the twelve months of November, with the data encouraging the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its final meeting of the year last month.Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, stood at 3.2% in December, unchanged from November, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.\"Inflation ticked up a little in December, driven partly by higher tobacco prices, following recently-introduced excise duty increases,\" the ONS' Chief Economist Grant Fitzner commented on X Wednesday.\"Airfares also contributed to the increase with prices rising more than a year ago, likely because of the timing of return flights over the Christmas and New Year period. Rising food costs, particularly for bread and cereals, were also an upward driver,\" he added.These increases were partially offset by a fall in rents inflation and lower prices for a range of recreational and cultural purchases, the ONS noted.Pound sterling was largely flat against the dollar following the data, at $1.3231.Chancellor Rachel Reeves told CNBC Wednesday that the Bank of England had expected inflation to rise slightly before it's expected to cool into spring and summer, toward the central bank's 2% target.\"That continues to be their expectation and that continues to be my expectation, and that's going to happen because of the measures I took in my budget last year,\" she told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The figures, coming after employment data on Monday which showed further cooling in the labor market, still raise doubts over whether the BOE will proceed with its expected February rate cut, or could hold off a little longer, however.\"A small monthly rise in prices is unlikely to concern policymakers at the Bank of England in the short-term, especially as pay growth continues on a downwards trajectory,\" Scott Gardner, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Personal Investing, said in emailed comments Wednesday.\"If pay growth continues to fall and this is reflected in inflation data, it could place pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates faster than expected. Markets are currently pricing in one to two cuts this year but this could change as inflation data for 2026 starts coming through,\" he said.Matthew Ryan, head of Market Strategy at Ebury, said he expects the BOE to remain on hold for at least the next couple of meetings.\"The hawks on the committee have long emphasised upside risks to U.K. inflation, but these arguments are losing steam amid the deteriorating employment picture and the moderation in wage pressures,\" he noted Tuesday.",

Overall, 92.7% of all the EWIT shares, excluding those held by Saba, voted against the proposals. The decision marks a second defeat for Saba Capital in its long-running and at times bitter campaign against the board of Edinburgh Worldwide, a U.K. fund which invests in cutting-edge public and private technology companies.The New York-based $6 billion hedge fund firm, which has raised its holding of EWIT's shares from 25% to 30%, first attempted to shake up EWIT's board in February last year, but ultimately failed to win investor support.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.Jonathan Simpson-Dent, Chair of Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust, criticized the activist campaign as a \"significant and costly distraction.\"\"For the second time in less than a year, Edinburgh Worldwide's shareholders have voted decisively to reject Saba's proposal to install its own nominees to the board and the uncertainty that would have entailed,\" Simpson-Dent said in a statement.\"Saba remains our largest shareholder and we will continue to seek constructive engagement with them to develop potential solutions that allow us to move forward.\"EWIT's total assets stood at £847.15 million ($1.1 billion) as of Oct. 31.'An aggressive campaign'Weinstein focused heavily on EWIT's large discount to net asset value.

In an open letter earlier this month, Weinstein accused EWIT's board of \"misleading\" shareholders over a sell-down of its SpaceX shares.Responding Jan. 7, EWIT said the U.S. hedge fund was running \"an aggressive campaign\" to \"seize control of the company to prioritize its own commercial interests to the potential detriment of other shareholders.\"CNBC has contacted Saba Capital representatives for comment.The persistent NAV discounts prevalent across many U.K. investment trusts has become a cornerstone trade for Weinstein's firm in recent years, where the manager believes a \"storm\" is brewing for shareholders.In a separate move, Saba Capital last week called for a wind-down of Workspace Group, a real estate investment trust (REIT) which operates office properties across London and the south-east of England.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 800 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each dropped more than 2%. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" spiked to a highs last seen in November.The latest flare-up in so-called sell America positioning follows Trump's threats to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries as part of his push to take over Greenland. Representatives from the 27-nation European Union gathered for an emergency meeting in response to Trump's tariff call, which he said would start Feb. 1 and then rise to 25% on June 1.watch nowGreenland has repeatedly rejected Trump's request to purchase the arctic island, with Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen saying Monday that it would \"not be pressured\" and \"stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law.\" European officials are reportedly considering using a salvo of counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures against the U.S. in retaliation.The \"sell America\" trade suggests that global investors will place higher risk premiums on U.S. investments amid fears that the U.S. is no longer a reliable trading partner. Following Trump's latest threats, some investors worry that European countries could dump U.S. assets in a show of power.\"On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars.

    "body": "watch nowAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are starting to be reflected in the price of some items, as sellers weigh how to absorb the shock of the added costs.Amazon and many of its third-party merchants pre-purchased inventory to try to get ahead of the tariffs and keep prices low for customers, but most of that supply ran out last fall, Jassy said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between,\" Jassy said. \"I think you're starting to see more of that impact.\" The comments are a notable shift from last year, when Jassy said Amazon hadn't seen \"prices appreciably go up\" a few months after Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs. Last April, Jassy also predicted that some sellers may be forced to pass the added cost of the tariffs on to consumers because some businesses \"don't have 50% extra margin that you can play with.\" Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateAmazon sellers previously told CNBC they were considering or had already raised the price of some items due to higher import costs in the wake of the tariffs. A major retail trade association warned last August that the trade war would loom over companies' inventory ordering plans this Spring, which could lead to higher prices, fewer products on the shelves and job losses.  Amazon is trying to \"keep prices as low as possible\" for consumers, but in some cases, price hikes may be unavoidable, Jassy said Tuesday.\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy said. \"You don't have endless options,\" he added.Consumers remain \"pretty resilient\" and are still spending amid the tariffs, Jassy said. But they have impacted some shoppers' purchasing habits, with Amazon observing some people trading down to lower priced items and bargain hunting, while others are holding off from buying higher-priced discretionary products, he said.watch now",

For the first quarter, United forecast per-share earnings of $1 to $1.50, while analysts had estimated $1.13 a share.

    "body": "Lisa Cook, governor of the US Federal Reserve, and U.S. President Donald Trump.Ting Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images | Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Wednesday morning in a case over whether President Donald Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook for uncharged allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.At stake is not only the fate of Cook — who denies any wrongdoing — but potentially the Fed's future independence to set monetary policy without the risk of a president being able to easily remove a governor who fails to do their bidding on that issue.Underscoring those stakes is the recent disclosure by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that he is the subject of a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with his oversight of a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters there.Powell, who plans to attend Wednesday's arguments at the Supreme Court, has said the real reason for that probe is the Fed holding interest rates steady for much of last year to Trump's ire.Cook was one of the Fed governors who backed Powell in maintaining those rates. When Trump moved to fire Cook in late August — the first time a president had ever attempted such a move — there was immediate speculation it was due to her refusal to agree to cut interest rates as Trump wanted.If Cook and Powell were to be removed from the Fed's seven-member board, Trump would be in a position to appoint a majority of that board — and, theoretically at the least, have more influence over interest rate decisions.Trump did not cite Cook's stance on interest rates when he said he was firing her.Instead, the president cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that she had made false statements in applying for home mortgages, which predated her appointment to the Fed by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 to fill an unexpired board term. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term.Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, only the president can terminate a Fed board member, and a governor like Cook can only be terminated \"for cause.\"The law does not detail what would constitute \"cause,\" but cause has historically been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.After Cook sued Trump to block her removal from the Fed, a federal District Court judge in Washington ruled that she could remain with the central bank pending the outcome of her lawsuit.Judge Jia Cobb, in that ruling, wrote that \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"Cobb said that \"best reading\" of that provision is that the alleged cause for removal relates to a governor's actions while \"in office.\"The allegations against Cook relate to actions she took before joining the Fed.The Department of Justice appealed Cobb's ruling, but was unsuccessful. The DOJ then asked the Supreme Court to take the case.In a filing, the DOJ said that the \"determination of cause\" for termination is subject to \"the unreviewable discretion of the President.\"\"In any case, the President has identified sufficient cause here,\" the filing says.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

(Photo by Fang Dongxu/VCG via Getty Images)Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's technology giants are entering a new phase of the artificial intelligence race called 'agentic commerce,' as firms such as Alibaba and ByteDance race to turn chatbots into full-service shopping and payment tools.Alibaba last week updated its Qwen AI chatbot, allowing users to complete transactions directly within the interface, including ordering food and booking air tickets.The upgrade connects Qwen to Alibaba's broader e-commerce ecosystem, allowing users to compare tailored product recommendations from platforms such as Taobao or its travel site Fliggy, before finally completing payments through Alipay, all without leaving the chatbot.Previously, Qwen could make recommendations based on user-generated prompts, but users still had to manually navigate multiple platforms to make purchases.The update reflects a broader shift among some global artificial intelligence firms from a focus on foundational AI models to \"agentic AI\", which performs tasks on behalf of users with limited supervision.\"The agentic transformation of commercial services enables the maximal integration of user services [and] enhances user stickiness,\" Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint Research, referring to stronger long-term user engagement.That allows companies to build a sustainable competitive advantage, often called a business moat, which helps protect profits from competitors, he added.While commercial applications for agentic AI are expected to range from autonomous driving to cybersecurity, e-commerce is emerging as one of its earliest and most pervasive use cases, with payment and tech giants in the U.S. also rolling out their first iterations in recent months.Within China, Alibaba is well-positioned to be a pioneer in agentic commerce due to its advanced large language model capabilities and its extensive e-commerce network covering clothing, food, housing, and transportation, Wang said.Growing global competitionAlibaba's strategy could help it compete with rival super apps such as Tencent's WeChat — widely regarded as China's leading 'super app' — which combines messaging, payments, e-commerce and other services into a single platform used by over 1 billion users.Other Chinese firms are also moving quickly. ByteDance in December upgraded its popular Doubao AI chatbot to autonomously handle tasks such as ticket bookings through integrations with e-commerce features on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.The upgraded Doubao model was introduced on a prototype smartphone developed by ZTE Corp as a comprehensive AI assistant capable of performing tasks across a user's mobile device. However, some of Doubao's planned features were later scaled back after rivals raised privacy and security concerns.Meanwhile, Tencent President Martin Lau said during the company's May 2025 earnings call that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem. \"AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration across payments, logistics, and social engagement,\" Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told CNBC.While Chinese firms like Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance will compete to embed agents across their platforms, they all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioral data, and consumer familiarity with super apps, said Dai.Western companies, while leading in foundational AI models and global reach, face more fragmented data and stricter privacy regulations, slowing cross-service integration, he added.U.S. players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and Amazon. Google is also exploring ways to position itself as a \"matchmaker\" between merchants, consumers and AI agents.\"China will prioritize domestic integration and strategic expansion in selected regions, while U.S. firms focus on global scalability and governance,\" Dai noted.Approximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a 2025 McKinsey study. The report estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for U.S. businesses by 2030 by streamlining important yet routine steps in consumer decision-making.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump is set Wednesday to speak at the World Economic Forum, directly addressing an audience that has been put on edge by his intensifying aggression toward the allied territory of Greenland.Trump's speech is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. ET. The address will be bookended by meetings with other world leaders attending the five-day summit in Davos, Switzerland, the White House said.Trump, facing a tough midterm election cycle centered on Americans' cost-of-living concerns, previously said he will speak at Davos about proposals to make housing more affordable.But it's his increasingly belligerent stance toward Europe, as he and his administration persist in trying to acquire Greenland from Denmark, that has already taken center stage.Trump and his aides have refused to rule out wielding the U.S. military over Greenland. And the president recently said he will slap increasing tariffs on a slew of key European allies until an agreement to sell the Arctic island is inked.U.S. markets plummeted in the first trading session following Trump's latest tariff threat.U.S. officials, speaking at Davos on Tuesday ahead of Trump's arrival, sought to calm fears about the president's actions.\"Everyone take a deep breath,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's Joe Kernen. \"Do not escalate ... President Trump has a strategy here. Hear him out, and then everything will be fine.\"watch nowCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" that America's \"tariff deals, our trade deals with Europe, with the U.K. — these are durable and stable.\"\"You can have a fight with your allies. You can disagree with your allies. It doesn't stop them from being your allies or your big trading partners,\" Lutnick added.Trump said at the White House before departing for Davos, \"We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland, and I think things are going to work out pretty well.\"His expansionist push has nevertheless stoked alarm and outrage from Europe's leaders and citizens alike.watch now\"People are worried, people are afraid, people are bewildered,\"  Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business and mineral resources, told CNBC on Tuesday when asked how residents there are reacting to Trump's actions.That assessment aligns with recent opinion polls, which show Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose being absorbed into the U.S., and protests that have sprung up in solidarity with the territory.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, meanwhile, said after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with the Trump administration.But Trump, who has long sought to make Greenland a part of the U.S., has so far refused to take no for an answer.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeTrump argues Greenland is a must-have asset for U.S. national security due to the alleged threats being posed in the Arctic by Russia and China.Amid the geopolitical upheaval, some European allies have increased their military presences in Greenland, drawing Trump's ire.Greenland is an autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark, which is a member of NATO, Europe's longstanding military alliance with the U.S. and Canada. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.Despite that — and despite the fact that the U.S. already has a military base in Greenland — Trump maintains that only a full acquisition can guarantee security in the region.\"China and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday.In the same post, Trump said he would slap tariffs on imports from eight NATO members, including France and the United Kingdom, in retaliation for moving troops to Greenland. The new tariffs will start at 10% next month and increase to 25% in June, Trump wrote.Those European countries are now considering imposing major economic counter-measures on the U.S. in response.\"Tariff threats are unacceptable ... Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday. \"We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.\"Trump's view of Macron has since appeared to sour.When asked to respond to reporting that Macron would not join the so-called Board of Peace centered on resolving conflicts in Gaza, Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on French wine.\"Nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon,\" Trump added.Trump also revealed that he has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to join that board.Early Tuesday morning, Trump shared on social media an apparent screenshot of a text message from Macron, who wrote that he doesn't understand the U.S. leader's strategy on Greenland.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump arrives for an announcement in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Will Oliver | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDrug pricing. Looming patent cliffs. Dealmaking. The first year of Trump 2.0.Those are among the themes that dominated conversations last week as drugmakers of all sizes met with investors to map out their plans for 2026 and beyond at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. After geopolitical uncertainty weighed on dealmaking during the first half of 2025, investors and drugmakers sounded optimistic that 2026 may mark a turning point for the sector. Investors are beginning to see signs of recovery in U.S. biotech so far this year after years of volatility, betting that lower interest rates and a renewed appetite for deals will reopen the IPO window.The conference lacked the splashy, high-dollar acquisitions that typically take center stage there. But big pharma made it clear it is on the hunt for potential buyouts and collaborations as it looks to make up for roughly $300 billion in possible lost revenue as patents for blockbuster drugs expire toward the end of the decade. Some concerns around President Donald Trump's health-care policy agenda have eased after more than a dozen major drugmakers ended 2025 with landmark drug pricing deals and three-year reprieves from tariffs. When asked about whether he still held to his prediction last year that Trump will be a positive for the sector, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told reporters last week, \"Yes,\" even though \"I got scared big time\" along the way.Still, investors are trying to understand how the drug pricing agreements will impact businesses, and parse out the implications of policy changes like softer U.S. vaccine recommendations. Here's what we heard from pharma executives about the year ahead. Drug pricing Some executives said the recent drug pricing deals — part of Trump's \"most-favored-nation\" policy — reduce uncertainty and will likely have a modest impact on their businesses. The agreements involve lowering prices of certain products for Medicaid patients by tying them to the lowest ones abroad, and agreeing to sell some medicines at a discount on direct-to-consumer platforms, including the administration's upcoming TrumpRx site. \"I don't want to give the impression that there's no impact from [the most-favored-nation deal], because there is,\" Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson told reporters at a media event Wednesday morning. \"The question for us is, can we manage that and deliver an attractive long-range plan? We feel, so far, we can.\"Sanofi and several other companies with pricing deals could outline how they expect the agreements to affect their businesses when they release their 2026 outlooks in the coming weeks.Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson speaks during an event held by President Donald Trump to make an announcement about lowering drug prices, at the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersAstraZeneca expects the initial effects of its drug pricing deal to be limited and manageable, as it so far applies to a specific Medicaid population and represents \"a low single-digit percentage\" of the company's global sales, said CFO Aradhana Sarin during a presentation on Jan. 13. Meanwhile, Bourla told reporters on Jan. 12 that the deals will help companies pressure European countries to increase what they will pay for drugs, similar to how the U.K. agreed in December to raise prices for medicines as part of a trade deal with the U.S.He said companies could stop supplying medicines to some countries that refuse to pay more. \"Do you reduce [U.S.] prices to France's level or stop supplying France? You stop supplying France,\" Bourla said. \"So they will stay without new medicines ... because the system will force us not to be able to accept the lower prices.\"Patent losses, dealmakingPharmaceutical companies were confident they will be able to offset losses from upcoming patent expirations of popular drugs and zeroed in on dealmaking as a critical tool to add new revenue. Cheaper generic versions of brand-name drugs typically enter the market after their patents expire, leading to significant price drops and a loss of market share over time due to increased competition. During a presentation on Jan. 12, Merck CEO Rob Davis said his company hopes \"to grow through\" the upcoming loss of exclusivity for its top-selling cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Merck raised its outlook for new products, saying those items will contribute a projected $70 billion in sales by the mid-2030s. That is almost double what Wall Street expects Keytruda to record in 2028 before its patent expires. Keytruda generated $29.48 billion in sales in 2024, which was nearly half of Merck's total revenue for that year. Davis indicated that Merck may not be done with dealmaking, especially for later-stage or already-approved products. \"If you look from a dollar perspective, we've been looking in that up to $15 billion dollar range,\" he said. \"We've been very clear that we're willing to go larger than that, but we only will do so following the exact same logic and discipline.\"Bristol Myers Squibb has the highest exposure to the upcoming loss of exclusivity cycle, with blockbuster drugs such as the blood thinner Eliquis set to face generic competition, according to a note from JPMorgan analysts in late December. Eliquis raked in $13.3 billion in sales in 2024, making up more than a quarter of the company's revenue for the year. But in an interview on Jan. 13, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has the potential to deliver up to 10 new products by the end of the decade.\"We feel really good about the substrate we have in late-stage development, and the mid-stage pipeline is also progressing nicely,\" he told CNBC. Boerner highlighted 11 late-stage data readouts in 2026 across six potential new products. Boerner said the company is \"casting a wide net\" for its business development.He added that Bristol Myers Squibb is hoping to build on the core therapeutic areas it knows well, look across different phases of development and focus on \"the best, most innovative science that we can find\" to tackle difficult-to-treat diseases. This year, Novo Nordisk is also facing patent expirations for semaglutide — the active ingredient in its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and obesity counterpart Wegovy — in certain countries, including Canada and China. Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said 2026 \"will be the year of price pressure\" due to generic competition in some international markets and its U.S. drug pricing deal. He added that Novo Nordisk aims to offset price cuts with volume growth and will be active in business development to see what \"can complement our own pipeline.\" Those comments come after Novo Nordisk lost a heated bidding war with Pfizer last year over the obesity biotech Metsera.Vaccine rhetoric Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announces new nutrition policies during a press conference at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, Jan. 8, 2026.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersSome executives reiterated concerns about the administration's changes to U.S. immunization policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a prominent vaccine skeptic — and his appointees. That includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recent move to roll back the number of immunizations routinely recommended for children. \"I'm very annoyed. I'm very disappointed,\" Pfizer's Bourla said, adding that \"what is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda, which is political.\" He added, \"I think we do see that there are reductions in vaccination rates of kids and that will raise diseases, and I'm certain about that.\" But Bourla said he doesn't believe the recent changes to the childhood vaccine schedule will impact Pfizer's bottom line. He said the pressure the administration is putting on immunizations \"is an anomaly that will correct itself.\" Meanwhile, Sanofi's Hudson said the scrutiny of vaccines by the Trump administration is aligned with what the company expected ahead of the 2024 election. \"I've had conversations with Kennedy, we just try to stick to the facts of the evidence,\" Hudson said. \"There's not much we can do.\"I just hope that the evidence is enough in the end with all these things,\" he added. ",

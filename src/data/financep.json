    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks with members of the media following a call with military service members, on Thanksgiving, in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., Nov. 27, 2025. Anna Rose Layden | ReutersThe White House on Friday evening named the Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent as \"media offender of the week,\" blasting their coverage of a video released by Democratic lawmakers telling the U.S. military that they can disobey illegal orders.The Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Last week, six Democrats, all with military or national security experience, released a video reminding service members that they have the right to refuse illegal orders. President Donald Trump accused them of \"seditious behavior\" and said that in \"the old days\" that was \"punishable by death.\" The FBI is now seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly and the other Democrats featured in the video.The White House has denied that Trump has ever issued illegal orders. However, some experts have said the Pentagon's deadly campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean is unlawful. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth verbally ordered to kill all crew members on a suspected drug boat. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a Marine Corps veteran, told the newspaper that Americans will eventually be prosecuted for this, \"either as a war crime or outright murder.\"",

Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSouth Korea became the latest country to impose sanctions on Prince Group, a multinational network accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia. Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added. Prince Group is accused of operating large-scale online 'scam centers' in Cambodia and Myanmar that used trafficked workers to defraud victims around the world. South Korean sanctions target 15 people and 132 entities linked to the network.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New YorkSouth Korea and Cambodia agreed in October to set up a joint task force to help tackle online crimes, after a university student died of torture in August in a scam compound.Prince Group has denied any wrongdoing. In a Nov. 11 statement issued through U.S. law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, the group called the allegations \"baseless.\"\"The recent allegations are baseless and appear aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets worth billions of dollars,\" the Cambodia-based network said, adding that it had engaged a team of lawyers from the U.S. legal powerhouse.CNBC has reached out to Prince Group and Boies Schiller Flexner for comment and didn't immediately hear back.Crackdown widensThe latest action against Prince Group builds on broader international efforts to curb scam networks in the region. On Oct. 14, the U.S. and UK announced sweeping sanctions on Prince Group, which the U.S. Treasury Department designated as a \"Transnational Criminal Organization.\"The U.S. Department of Justice also seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin on Oct. 14, held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by Cambodian national Chen Zhi, the chairman of Prince Group. Zhi, a 38-year-old Chinese-born emigre who is also known as \"Vincent,\" was also charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy and remains at large.Chart of The Prince Group Transnational Criminal OrganizationU.S. Treasury DepartmentAnother Cambodian financial network, Huione Group, was also banned from the U.S. financial system on the same day, which the U.S. Treasury Department accused in May of colluding with North Korean cybercriminals.\"Huione Group serves as a critical node for laundering proceeds of cyber heists carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and for [Transnational Criminal Organizations] in Southeast Asia perpetrating virtual currency investment scams, commonly known as \"pig butchering\" scams, among others,\" the U.S. Treasury Department said.Seoul's sanctions announced Thursday also target the Huione Group. The British government said the centers in Southeast Asia used fake job adverts to lure workers, who were then forced to commit online fraud, including love scams and crypto scams, under threat of torture.In October, Singapore had seized over 150 million Singapore dollars of assets linked to the group. The Singapore Police Force said these included bank accounts, securities accounts and cash.",

    "body": "A worker walks past molten steel at a steel factory in Huai'an, in China's eastern Jiangsu province on July 22, 2025.    - | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity edged higher in November but remained stuck in contraction for the eighth consecutive month, while services weakened as the boost from earlier holidays faded, according to official data released Sunday.The manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 49.2, up 0.2 points from October, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The figures were in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll, but remained below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.The non-manufacturing business activity index fell to 49.5, down 0.6 points from October, while the composite PMI output index eased to 49.7, indicating a slight pullback in both manufacturing and services activities.Supply and demand in manufacturing improved modestly, said Huo Lihui, chief statistician at the bureau's Service Industry Survey Center, with the production index reaching the 50 threshold and new orders rising to 49.2. High-tech manufacturing stayed in expansion for a tenth straight month at 50.1, even as equipment manufacturing and consumer goods producers slipped below 50. Energy-intensive industries posted a mild rebound to 48.4, up 1.1 percentage points from October.Business activity for small enterprises recorded a significant rebound. The PMI for small enterprises jumped 2 percentage points to 49.1, its highest in nearly six months, while medium-sized firms edged up to 48.9. Large manufacturers weakened, falling to 49.3.Market confidence showed a slight uptick. The index measuring expectations for production and operations rose to 53.1. Industries including non-ferrous metal smelting and aerospace-related equipment reported particularly strong sentiment, with readings above 57.Holiday boost fadesNon-manufacturing activity, covering construction and services, softened, weighed down by services. Huo attributed the decline partly to the fading impact of earlier holiday-driven spending. China's Golden Week holiday, which typically lifts travel and consumer spending before activity normalizes in the following months, ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year.Service-sector activity fell to 49.5,  down 0.6 percentage points from October, though pockets of strength remained: railway transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting and satellite transmission, and financial services all posted readings above 55.Real estate and residential services continued to lag below the 50 mark, underscoring persistent weakness in property-related activity. Construction activity improved to 49.6, aided by stronger expectations for near-term growth, with that sector's sentiment index climbing to 57.9.The non-manufacturing new orders index slipped to 45.7, reflecting softer demand. Input prices rose to 50.4, and service-sector sales prices, while still below 50, narrowed their decline.Manufacturing employment ticked up slightly to 48.4, while non-manufacturing employment rose marginally to 45.3. Supplier delivery times for factories improved to 50.1.China surveys roughly 3,200 manufacturers and 4,300 non-manufacturing firms for the monthly PMI readings, which are seasonally adjusted and considered a leading indicator for economic momentum.Trade strainsChina's manufacturing activity has contracted since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump launched new tariffs that squeezed producers.Industrial profits fell 5.5% in October, the sharpest drop since June, reversing the strong gains seen in late summer. Earnings for the first ten months at major industrial firms rose 1.9%, slowing from the January–September pace.The broader Chinese economy has cooled as growth slipped to 4.8% in the third quarter.Trade tensions with the U.S. spiked in October as Washington threatened new 100% tariffs before both sides reached a late-month deal in South Korea. The agreement cut U.S. fentanyl-linked tariffs to 10% from 20%, paused Beijing's rare-earth controls for a year and reopened China's purchases of American soybeans and other farm goods.Despite the truce, demand at home remains soft. A drawn-out property slump and weak labor conditions are weighing on consumer spending. Policymakers have signaled a longer-term push to lift consumption and tech self-reliance but have avoided major new stimulus as the economy remains on track to meet its 5% growth target.",

The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.United Airlines said six aircraft in its fleet were affected, and the carrier expected \"minor disruption to a few flights.\"  Delta Air Lines said less than 50 of its Airbus A320 fleet were affected.Japan's ANA Holdings canceled 95 domestic flights Saturday, affecting around 13,200 passengers. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft.watch nowAir India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled.Scoot, another carrier under the Singapore Airlines group, said 21 of its 29 A320s required the fix and that it aimed to complete the work by Saturday.In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. \"As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November,\" a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC.The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an \"uncommanded and limited pitch down event.\"  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also issued an emergency directive later that day, ordering operators of the affected model to address the glitch.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: \"The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations.\"",

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% is likely to be defeated. A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"watch nowLegge said a 50% tax would likely lead to tax revenue falling. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse has called talk of an inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion\"\"We are dependent on good tax payers to finance our state,\" it warned.Legge said Switzerland faced competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, but added Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowWhen asked whether wealthy clients were scared, Giorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, told CNBC on Tuesday, \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management. We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. If successful, money raised from the tax would fund policies to combat climate change.",

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Silver, often nicknamed the 'Devil's metal' because of its volatility, has reached record highs this year and still has further to run despite a supply crunch, according to experts.The metal's growth value has been running alongside gold's, which has seen its own rally with the price surging past $4,000 an ounce this year.Silver prices reached a historic peak of $54.47 per troy ounce in mid October, marking a 71% rise year-on-year. They've since pared back gains somewhat, but are now growing again, despite low supply levels.\"Some people were having to transport silver by plane rather than on cargo ships to meet delivery demand,\" Paul Syms, head of EMEA ETF Fixed Income and commodity product management at Invesco, told CNBC.\"While we've seen the spike up, we've seen the price come down a little bit. Longer term, there's a different dynamic this time that could keep silver at reasonably high prices and maybe continuing to go up for some time to come,\" he added.October was only the third time in the past 50 years where silver prices peaked. Other silver price highs include January 1980, when the Hunt brothers amassed a third of the world's supply as they attempted to corner the market, as well as 2011, following the U.S. debt ceiling crisis when silver and gold were embraced as safe haven assets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices year-to-date\"Silver is only about a tenth the size of the gold market, and that short squeeze, obviously, sort of caught a few investors by surprise,\" said Syms.Unlike the previous investment waves, silver's boom in 2025 relied on a mix of low supply and high demand from India as well as industrial needs and tariffs.\"After Liberation Day, the gold price spiked, but silver actually went down a little bit. And the gold-silver ratio spiked to above 100,\" said Syms, referring to the gold-silver ratio which reflects how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold.A low ratio means gold is relatively cheap, while a high ratio indicates silver is undervalued and likely to rise. In April, the ratio reached a historic high.\"The risk managers in financial and industrial entities did not want to let any metal go out of the States for fear that it might come back in at 35% higher for example,\" said Rhona O'Connell, head of market analysis EMEA and Asia at Stone X.watch nowFast forward to the Autumn and silver entered its peak demand, especially as India's monsoon and harvest seasons came to an end.\"Farmers don't really like the banks very much, so gold and latterly, silver, tend to be the first port of call when they've got the harvest in,\" said O'Connell.India is also the world's largest consumer of silver, with about 4,000 metric tons used every year, mostly for jewelry, utensils and ornaments. The silver appeal this Autumn also coincided with Diwali, a five-day 'Festival of Lights' celebrating prosperity and good fortune and also India's biggest public holiday.Supply crunchWhile gold is traditionally a favorite, this year silver — an affordable investment option in a country where about 55% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood — outshined other metals.On Oct. 17, the price of silver in India rose sharply, reaching a record high of 170,415 rupees a kilogram — an 85% rise since the start of the year.However, 80% of India's silver supply is imported. The UAE and China are increasingly supporting that demand, but the U.K. is traditionally India's largest silver supplier.Yet, London's vaults have been emptying rapidly for the past few years. In June 2022, the London Bullion Market Association held 31,023 metric tons of silver. By March  2025, volumes had fallen by around a third to 22,126 metric tons — its lowest point in years.\"What isn't necessarily so visible to people is what's happening in the vaults,\" said O'Connell. \"And that had reached a point where there was basically there was no available metal left in London.\"In October, the squeeze was such that traders had to pay much higher borrowing costs – or lease rates – to close their positions.\"At one stage, to borrow overnight was costing 200% on an annualized basis, so a lot of people were very stressed to put it mildly,\" said O'Connell.Supply is a constant issue for silver, as for other precious and rare metals. The Silver Institute's 2025's World Silver Survey estimates that mine production has been decreasing over the past 10 years, especially in Central and South America.\"Over the course of the past twelve months or so, the underlying surplus has started to turn into a deficit for three reasons: the impact of the electrification of the vehicle fleet, artificial intelligence, and photovoltaics,\" said O'Connell.Read more\"At the moment, a standard electric vehicle has about 25 grams of silver, maybe the larger EVs have 50 grams of silver as part of their components,\" said Syms.\"If we move into these solid-state silver batteries, each electric vehicle might require a kilo or more of silver,\" he added.And with silver having a high thermal conductivity and a higher electrical conductivity than other metals, as well as increasing demand for EVs, AI and renewables, the metal's value is likely to keep shining.\"Silver crosses over that bridge between precious and industrial metals, and the way technology is going on, the batteries, the solar panels, it's got some great use cases as we move into a more electrified world,\" said Syms.",

    "body": "And just like that... December is upon us. It's been a volatile handover from November with U.S. major indices underperforming, dragged down by steep declines for the Nasdaq. Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets.So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year? Macy's Santa Claus is greeted by traders on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025.  Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThe case for a Santa RallyFidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a \"good place\" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December. The 'bah humbug' caseBut there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, \"fear of missing out.\" The central bank warned of \"sharp correlated price adjustments\" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks. watch nowCrypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the \"halving\" schedule, which happens every four years and \"programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.\"Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-endWhether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing.

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10?

    "body": "Bestselling author and wellness leader Deepak Chopra is optimistic about the possibilities of artificial intelligence. \"The thing is, AI is here to stay,\" he says. Chopra believes that while the technology can be harmful, it can also be beneficial when used very specifically for self-discovery. Chopra recommends using AI chatbots to get to know yourself better, suggesting questions like, \"What is my purpose?\" and \"How can I cultivate self-compassion?\"Chopra recently launched an online wellness platform that offers meditations, community discussion boards and live sessions led by Chopra himself. And he's bullish enough on AI to have created his very own Deepak Chopra chatbot. Unlike large language models such as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, Chopra's bot is what's called a small language model. Instead of training the bot on all of human knowledge, it's trained on Chopra's work, specifically.\"I've written 95 plus books,\" he says. \"I've done innumerable conferences. I have thousands of videos on YouTube and LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok. So I fed all that into my AI.\" Chopra platform subscribers pay $10 monthly, which includes chatbot access. Non-subscribers can pay from 50 cents per 30-minute session to $6 a month to use the bot.The thing is, AI is here to stay.Deepak ChopraAuthor, wellness guruUsers can choose from a series of existing prompts on subjects including success, relationships, sex and spirituality, or they can simply put in their own question. Answers come back in text format and can also be played out loud in Chopra's voice. But Chopra says the bot does have its limits: \"We will not be doing suicide prevention,\" he says. \"That's for professionals.\" Chopra's chatbot will not offer psychotherapy either, he says.Instead, Chopra says you can give the bot prompts like \"I haven't slept in five days, can you give me a meditation?\" or \"I'm having difficulty in my relationship because we're not communicating.\" \"Then, we give you guidelines,\" he says. Ultimately, Chopra says he wants people to cultivate empathy, compassion, joy and peace of mind, and that he wants to be a resource for users around the clock. \"You have me as your companion in your pocket all the time,\" he says.He adds that he wouldn't mind continuing to be a presence in his family's life. \"My grandchildren's grandchildren will be able to have a conversation with me long after I'm gone,\" he says.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

May 1, 2021.Gerard Miller(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)'He never stopped learning'In an \"exclusive\" article headlined \"The Untold Story of Charlie Munger's Final Years,\" The Wall Street Journal's Gregory Zuckerman reveals the \"Berkshire vice chair was making gutsy investments, forging unlikely friendships and facing new challenges to the end.\"Munger died two years ago on Nov. 28, 2023, at the age of 99, just a bit over a month shy of his 100th birthday.The Journal writes, \"Friends and family say Munger's eventful last period offers lessons for investors—and a blueprint for how to age with grace, equanimity and purpose.\"It quotes his stepson, Hal Borthwick as saying, \"To the day he died, his mind was running. He never stopped learning.\"He also never stopped looking for new investments, leafing through data on publicly traded companies in green Value Line binders.He went against conventional wisdom in 2023 by investing in two companies involved with coal, which he believed would still be needed due to rising demand for energy, despite environmental concerns.Borthwick tells The Journal, \"He read an article that said coal was down the chute. He said, 'Horse feathers.'\"Friends say he had paper gains of more than $50 million on coal miner Consol Energy and Alpha Metallurgical Resources, which provides coal for steel production.(Consol completed a merger with Arch Resources early this year to form Core Natural Resources.)Coal is excavated.Jim Urquhart | Reuters Munger also invested in real estate with an unusual partner.In 2005, Munger started mentoring a 17-year-old neighbor whose ADHD was contributing to his difficulties in school.Avi Mayer, now 37, tells the WSJ, \"He listened to my problems and talked about life principles and personal values.\"\"I watched him in action and learned from him, and he handed me books once in a while.\"Later, Munger backed a real estate company Mayer and a childhood friend established that has become one of the largest owners of low-rise \"garden\" apartments in California with around $3 billion in holdings.Munger \"remained involved until the end,\" helping to negotiate a building purchase that closed days after he died.The Journal says that as Munger grew older, he spent more time with friends, including a regular Tuesday morning country club breakfast with business associates that could go on for hours.He became less \"cranky and acerbic,\" telling the group, \"At my age, you make new friends, or you don't have any friends.\"And after many years, Munger's family gave up on trying to keep him on a healthy diet.The wife of his grandson reports Munger's last food delivery was a whole Korean fired chicken, kimchi fried rice, and waffle fries.A friend relates that even as Munger joked that he longed to be \"86 again,\" he remained optimistic about Berkshire's future.\"Once it's built, you don't need to be Warren and Charlie. What we have is a framework for looking at investments.\"BUFFETT AROUND THE INTERNETHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ARCHIVEMunger: 'A life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn' (2017)Charlie Munger explains why making mistakes is vital to success.AUDIENCE MEMBER: With all due respect, Mr. Buffett, this question is for Mr. Munger. (Laughter)In your career of thousands of negotiations and business dealings, could you describe for the crowd which one sticks out in your mind as your favorite or is otherwise noteworthy?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don't think I've got a favorite. But the one that probably did us the most good as a learning experience was See's Candy.It's just the power of the brand, the unending flow of ever-increasing money with no work. (Laughter)AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sounds nice. (Laughter)CHARLIE MUNGER: It was. And I'm not sure we would have bought the Coca-Cola if we hadn't bought the See's.I think that a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. And I think Berkshire's gained enormously from these investment decisions by learning through a long, long period.Every time you appoint a new person that's never had big capital allocation experience, it's like rolling the dice. And I think we're way better off having done it so long. And —But the decisions blend, and the one feature that comes through is the continuous learning. If we had not kept learning, you wouldn't even be here.You'd be alive probably, but not here. (Laughter)WARREN BUFFETT: There's nothing like the pain of being in a lousy business — (laughs) — to make you appreciate a good one.CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, there's nothing like getting into a really good one. That's a very pleasant experience and it's a learning experience.I have a friend who says, \"The first rule of fishing is to fish where the fish are. And the second rule of fishing is to never forget the first rule.\" (Laughter)And we've gotten good at fishing where the fish are.BERKSHIRE STOCK WATCHFour weeks:12 months:BERKSHIRE'S TOP EQUITY HOLDINGS - Nov. 28, 2025Berkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S. and Japan, by market value, based on the latest closing prices.Holdings are as of September 30, 2025, as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "A McDonald's restaurant in Richmond, Virginia, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMcDonald's on Wednesday fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations, but the company's U.S. restaurants reported better-than-expected same-store sales growth.CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement that the results are \"a testament to our ability to deliver sustainable growth even in a challenging environment.\" For more than a year, McDonald's, long considered a bellwether for the financial health of consumers, has been sounding the alarm about a pullback in restaurant spending, particularly from low-income diners.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.22 adjusted vs. $3.33 expectedRevenue: $7.08 billion vs. $7.1 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported third-quarter net income of $2.28 billion, or $3.18 per share, up from $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, a year earlier. McDonald's saw a higher effective tax rate during the quarter, which weighed on its earnings.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, the burger chain earned $3.22 per share.Revenue rose 3% to $7.08 billion.The company's same-store sales increased 3.6%, a reversal from the year-ago period's decline of 1.5% and roughly in line with Wall Street's expectations, according to StreetAccount.In the United States, McDonald's same-store sales increased 2.4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 1.9%. The company credited growth in average check, suggesting that diners are paying more for their meals despite the ongoing \"value wars\" between fast-food chains.In an appeal to budget-conscious consumers, McDonald's brought back its Snack Wraps for the first time in nine years and priced them at $3.99. And in September, the chain reintroduced Extra Value Meals, which it last promoted before the Covid-19 pandemic.Outside of the U.S., McDonald's saw even stronger same-store sales growth. Its international operated markets division, which includes Australia and Canada, reported a 4.3% increase in same-store sales. And its international developmental licensed markets segment saw its same-store sales grow 4.7%, lifted by demand in Japan.",

    "body": "Fire and smoke mark where a UPS cargo plane crashed near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Nov. 4, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen Cohen | Getty ImagesA UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.At least seven people were killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said on X, adding that the death toll is expected to rise. In an earlier press conference, he also said 11 people were injured in the incident, some of them significantly.UPS said in a statement that there were three crewmembers on the plane. It was unclear if the fatalities were from the plane or on the ground, and Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The reason for the crash was not immediately known. The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. The plane had hundreds of thousands of pounds of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said in the press conference.The Louisville Metro Police Department said on X that it was implementing a shelter-in-place order near the crash site. Several businesses near the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would create an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He said a petroleum recycling business and an an auto parts business are in the area and called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A plume of smoke wafts over airport property after reports of a plane crash at Louisville International Airport, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry | APA large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.The National Transportation Safety Board announced it is sending an investigation team to the incident site Wednesday.The airport was closed following the incident, and \"all arriving and departing flights at SDF are temporarily suspended,\" the airport said in a statement on X Tuesday evening.The airport is home to the UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world.\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville. Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company. UPS noted late Tuesday that it has halted package sorting operations at the facility.\"This is a UPS town,\" said Louisville city council member Betsy Ruhe.— CNBC's Dennis Green contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A jobseeker holds a brochure during a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmployment opportunities hit their lowest level in more than 4½ years as October came to a close and the government shutdown dragged on, according to data from jobs site Indeed.The firm's Job Postings Index fell to 101.9 as of Oct. 24, the most recent point for which data is available. That's the lowest since early February 2021 for a measure that uses February 2020 as a baseline value of 100.The level represents a 0.5% decline from the beginning of the month and a roughly 3.5% tumble from mid-August, the latest point from which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available.Under normal conditions, the BLS on Tuesday would have reported its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a measure that Federal Reserve officials watch closely for indications of slack in the jobs market. With the shutdown on the precipice of being the longest in history, economists and policymakers are left to look at alternative data for big-picture indicators.The most recent JOLTS report, for August, also indicated an ongoing decline in openings. The BLS reported that job openings totaled 7.23 million, about level with July but down 7% from January.Indeed's dashboard of indicators also has shown a pullback in salary offerings as job advertisements have declined. Year-over-year wages as judged by salary offerings in Indeed postings rose 2.5% in August, down from 3.4% in January.A softening labor market has generated concern from Fed officials. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 10-2 to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%.Officials have cited rising risks to the labor market taking precedence over ongoing concerns about inflation holding nearly a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target.\"Hiring is slowing. We see this from Indeed, from job postings,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said Monday. \"We're looking at a panoply of data, and those are real time. We're not waiting on the unemployment report. There's reason to be concerned, because there's a slight uptick in the unemployment rate over the summer.\"The nonfarm payrolls report normally would be released Friday, but that also is not happening. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the BLS count would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs in October and an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%.",

    "body": "A sign with the Toyota logo in Surrey, England on August, 2023Peter Dazeley | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesToyota Motor on Wednesday raised the operating profit forecast for its financial year ending in March, while flagging a 1.45 trillion yen hit from U.S. tariffs.The company, which revised its operating profit outlook to 3.4 trillion yen from 3.2 trillion yen forecast earlier, missed profit estimates for the quarter ended September. \"Despite the impact of U.S. tariffs, strong demand supported by the competitiveness of our products has led to increased sales volumes mainly in Japan and North America and has expanded value chain profits,\" Toyota said in its earnings report.Here are Toyota's September quarter results compared with mean estimates from LSEG:Revenue: 12.38 trillion yen (about $81 billion) vs. 12.18 trillion yenOperating profit: 834 billion yen vs. 863.1 billion yenThe world's largest carmaker by sales volume reported a nearly 28% quarterly drop in profit, year on year, while revenue increased over 8%. Net income reached 972.9 billion yen, upToyota released 6-month results — from April to September — and the quarterly numbers have been calculated by CNBC, based on company statement and LSEG data.The decline in the September quarter's operating profit represents the second straight drop since the U.S. introduced \"reciprocal\" tariffs in April. Tokyo in July clinched a trade deal with Washington, bringing down tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from the 25% initially proposed by President Donald Trump. The 15% duties took effect on Aug. 7.The company flagged that tariffs remain the largest drag on Toyota's profit in the U.S., while factors such exchange rate fluctuations and increased expenses hit earnings in Japan, .A Toyota executive said in the earnings call that the company was \"assessing challenges\" and \"making preparations\" for a plan to ship made-in-U.S. vehicles to customers in Japan, as to align with a new investment framework between Tokyo and Washington.They added that the plan may not be \"economically rational,\" but could make certain products more available to Japanese customers.Tariffs biteThe impacts of U.S. tariffs have been sharply felt across Japan's auto industry, with Japanese shipments of automobiles to the U.S. dropping 24.2% in September, though this was slightly less compared to the 28.4% drop in August.While Toyota has extensive North American production, about one-fifth of its U.S. sales still depend on Japanese imports and tariff costs on those imports are being absorbed rather than passed through, according to Liz Lee, associate director at Counterpoint Research. \"We're expecting profitability to remain under pressure in [the current quarter] as tariff and currency headwinds persist, with gradual improvement likely from the [March quarter] onwards,\" Lee told CNBC in a statement.  \"Profitability should recover modestly next fiscal year if trade costs stabilize and the yen weakens, though rising EV competition will continue to cap upside potential,\" she added. Toyota has increasingly been leaning into electrified vehicles, which accounted for 46.9% of Toyota and Lexus vehicle sales in the first half of its fiscal year. These sales were primarily driven by hybrid electric vehicles in regions such as North America and China.However, Toyota's limited lineup of fully electric battery-powered vehicles could leave it more exposed to competition from Chinese EV players in Europe and Southeast Asia, Lee said.Despite decreasing profits, Toyota has continued to show strong global demand. The company recently reported that vehicle sales, including its luxury brand Lexus, reached 5.3 million in the nine months to September, a 4.7% increase from a year earlier. In it's earnings report, the company said it would continue to focus on increasing sales volume and cutting costs.",

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Tuesday, March 25, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLast week saw a big swing in mortgage interest rates, and that took a toll on demand. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.9% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.For the week, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.31% from 6.30% for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the weekly average, but rates actually fell to the lowest level in over a year last Tuesday and then shot up sharply Wednesday afternoon, following the announcement on interest rates from the Federal Reserve and comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. Rates continued to rise Thursday, according to a separate report from Mortgage News Daily, and then came back very slightly Friday.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to daily moves in interest rates, fell 3% for the week, although they were still 151% higher than the same week one year ago. Refinancing had been on a run in the weeks before because interest rates last year at this time were higher.\"The average loan size for refinance applications was at its highest level in six weeks, as borrowers with larger loans continued to seek ways to lower their monthly payments,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist in a release.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 1% for the week and were 26% higher than the same week one year ago.\"Purchase applications declined slightly from a week ago, however, there was slight increase in FHA purchase applications as prospective homebuyers continue to seek loan options to help manage challenging affordability conditions,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates moved slightly higher to start this week and could move more decidedly in either direction after economic data on employment is released Wednesday.",

The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year.Orsted flagged third-quarter impairment costs of nearly 1.8 billion Danish kroner.The company, however, reiterated its full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) guidance of 24-27 billion Danish kroner, excluding earnings from new partnerships and cancellation fees.It comes shortly after the company announced it had reached a deal to sell a 50% stake in its Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm in the U.K. to Apollo Global Management in a deal worth $6 billion.\"I'm satisfied with the good progress across our entire construction portfolio and our solid operational performance,\" Orsted CEO Rasmus Errboe said in a statement.\"Our key focus is to continue delivering on our business plan, which will enable Ørsted to remain a global leader of offshore wind with a strong foothold in Europe,\" he added.Shares of Orsted were 1.2% higher on Wednesday morning. The stock price has fallen sharply this year amid concerted efforts from the White House to halt several ongoing developments and suspend new licensing.Vestas shares popDanish wind turbine firm Vestas, meanwhile, reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings.The firm on Wednesday said that operating profit came in at 416 million euros ($477.8 million) for the July-September period, above expectations of 305 million euros estimated by analysts in a company-compiled consensus.Shares of Vestas jumped more than 14% on the news, soaring to the top of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index, as investors welcomed signs of a successful turnaround following years of losses.Asked about some of the headwinds facing the wind industry, notably from the Trump administration, Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said the company has a \"well-established\" supply chain in the U.S.\"For us, we see the U.S., both customers and the buildout in the U.S., as some of our core responsibility to help the U.S. with,\" Andersen told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.\"Then sometimes maybe we have to get a bit of a slap that it is not everyone that likes the nature of a wind turbine. But I think, in general, … energy drives decision making and [the] cost of energy drives decision making,\" he added.",

There's \"very unique and huge demand right now, and we are continuing to grow.\"Goldman Sachs Alternatives' growth equity fund anchored the investment, with participation from CapitalG, a venture arm of Alphabet. The security firm brought on Evolution Equity Partners as a new investor.Armis helps businesses secure and manage internet-connected devices and protect them against cyber threats. The company chose Goldman's growth fund due to its strong track record helping companies accelerate growth toward initial public offerings, Dibrov said.\"This is the partner for us to go to the next stage and continue to build here a real generational business to get to the Hall of Fame of cyber and SaaS businesses,\" he said.In September, Bloomberg reported that the company was exploring as much as seven stake offers. Dibrov told CNBC the funding round was an outcome of those talks.Founded in 2016, Armis in August said it surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenues.

    "body": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, arrives at court as lawyers push to persuade the judge overseeing his fraud case not to jail him ahead of trial, at a courthouse in New York, August 11, 2023.Eduardo Munoz | ReutersThe judges in a federal appeals court in New York on Tuesday were skeptical of arguments by a lawyer for Sam Bankman-Fried that his conviction for a multi-billion-dollar fraud related to his cryptocurrency exchange FTX and an associated hedge fund should be tossed out.Bankman-Fried's attorney, Alexandra Shapiro, was almost immediately and then repeatedly interrupted by the three-judge panel on the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals as she tried to make her case that SBF deserved a new trial because the first one was \"fundamentally unfair.\"\"From my reading of the record, [there was] very substantial evidence of guilt,\" Judge Barringon Parker told Shapiro.\"Are you seriously suggesting to us that if your client had been able to testify about the role that attorneys played in preparing these various documents, the not-guilty verdicts would have rolled in?\" Parker asked, as Bankman-Fried's parents looked on from the courtroom gallery.Bankman-Fried, 33, was convicted in November 2023 of seven criminal counts for fraud against customers of FTX and lenders to the hedge fund Alameda Research. He is serving a 25-year prison sentence.Defense lawyer Alexandra Shapiro makes oral arguments before United States Circuit Judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Barington D.

She added that there is another $8 billion left to cover $2 billion in remaining claims.Assistant U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn spent the bulk of his time during the hearing answering questions by the judge over how an $11 billion forfeiture against SBF is structured, and what will happen to that forfeiture order if all victims are made whole before the entire amount is spent.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown is about to become the nation's longest federal funding lapse ever.The shutdown is poised to hit that milestone on Wednesday, marking its 36th day and surpassing the previous record, which was set in early 2019.The latest attempt to break the logjam, by getting a Republican-backed stopgap measure passed by Congress, failed in the Senate for the 14th time on Tuesday.There are no further votes scheduled Tuesday on the GOP's short-term continuing resolution, or on an alternative proposal put forward by Democrats, which includes additional spending on health care and other priorities.Both of the longest government shutdowns in U.S. history occurred while President Donald Trump was in office.The funding dispute centers on enhanced tax credits for insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire by year's end, threatening to significantly hike health care costs for millions of Americans. Democrats have refused to vote for any \"clean\" stopgap resolution that does not address those subsidies. Republicans have rejected the prospect of negotiating while the government remains shut down. While Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, they need Democratic votes to overcome the chamber's 60-vote threshold.Some Republicans on Tuesday said they have grown \"optimistic\" that the shutdown could end this week.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters that he believes Democrats will be more open to cutting a deal after breaking the shutdown length record and after Tuesday's elections are complete.They will be able to tell their constituents \"we're fighting the President, and I think that's a major part of what this is about,\" Rounds said. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he was \"pretty confident\" the shutdown would end in the coming days.But some Democrats have poured cold water on the prospect of a coming compromise.\"There seems to be some indication of a thaw, but I see no immediate solution on the horizon,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.\"Talks are a good thing, but so far, I sense no willingness on the part of Republicans to really assure the American people that health care insurance will be guaranteed,\" he said.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked about Republicans' optimism, said, \"That would be nice. I hope that means Republicans are coming to the table to negotiate with Democrats, because so far, they have come to the table to negotiate exactly zero times.\" This is developing news.

The report comes about two weeks after Super Micro issued preliminary earnings and said it expected revenue of $5 billion for the quarter, down from prior guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion.Net income fell by more than half to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.In its partial report last month, Super Micro said \"design win upgrades\" pushed some expected first-quarter revenue to the second quarter. The company said it now expects sales of $10 billion to $11 billion in the current quarter, above the $7.83 billion average estimate, according to LSEG.Super Micro has been a big beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, as its servers come packed with graphics processing units from Nvidia. But after growth soared from late 2023 through last year, the business has flatlined, with some analysts saying that Dell has taken market share.Prior to Tuesday's report, the stock was up 55% for the year.WATCH: Going short on AI is a bad ideawatch now",

Phil Murphy, a Democrat finishing his second and final term.The race — one of just two U.S. gubernatorial elections this year — was seen as a bellwether for how President Donald Trump's policies are affecting support for Republicans nationally.Trump had endorsed Ciattarelli and vocally supported him during the campaign.Sherrill's projected win could help shape the electoral landscape for the 2026 midterms, when Democrats hope to retake control of at least one chamber of Congress.Sherrill, a former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot, has represented New Jersey's 11th congressional district in the House of Representatives since 2019.Ciattarelli is a businessman who has run for governor twice before.New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate, Jack Ciattarelli (L), and New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie SherrillGetty ImagesWhile Democrats far outnumber Republicans in New Jersey, some polls leading up to Tuesday's election showed a neck-and-neck race between the candidates.But early voting totals before Election Day showed Democrats building a solid turnout firewall, according to DecisionDeskHQ Data Science Director Michael Pruser.State officials said Tuesday morning that multiple polling places received non-credible bomb threats, causing some voters to be redirected to other sites to cast their ballots.Sherrill called the threats \"a clear attempt to undermine our democratic system and intimidate New Jerseyans from going to the polls to exercise their right to vote.\"Trump lost New Jersey to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. But he drew a larger share of the vote than he had received in the 2016 election, partly by making inroads with the state's Latino communities.Sherrill courted those voters who have traditionally favored Democrats, in part by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail and in TV ads.She has also run a campaign centered on affordability, hewing to Democrats' broader messaging strategy.\"Vote Here Today\" signage outside a polling location at Hillside Elementary School in Montclair, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. John Lamparski | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCiattarelli, whom Trump endorsed, ran a campaign that echoed much of the president's MAGA agenda.The election came in the middle of a protracted federal government shutdown, for which Americans blame Republicans and Trump more than Democrats, polls show.Both candidates raised over $20 million and spent nearly $17 million heading into the final stretch of the race.Despite suffering demoralizing losses in 2024 and grappling with persistently low approval ratings, Democrats have reasons to be optimistic about the 2026 cycle.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsTrump's approval ratings have fallen precipitously since the start of his term and are lower than where they stood at this point in his first term, according to multiple polls.Anti-Trump sentiment has been a galvanizing force for Democrats in the past and present, notably at the recent \"No Kings\" protests that drew millions of participants across the country.",

The leaders of some of the biggest technology and artificial intelligence companies will go to Congress on Thursday with a wish list of sorts that at its top has doing away with regulation they say inhibits their firms' growth and by default, sends business to China.Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAdvanced Micro Devices reported fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, but gave margin guidance was inline with estimates. The stock fell almost 5% in extended trading.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $1.20 adjusted vs. $1.16 expectedRevenue: $9.25 billion vs. $8.74 billion expectedRevenue increased 36% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Sept. 27, according to a statement.Net income climbed to $1.24 billion, or 75 cents per share, from $771 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.For the fourth quarter, AMD expects about $9.6 billion in revenue, implying 25% growth. That's above LSEG's $9.15 billion consensus. AMD sees an adjusted gross margin of 54.5% for the quarter, meeting StreetAccount's consensus of 54.5%.AMD, which is trying to keep pace with Nvidia in the market for artificial intelligence processors, said the guidance does not include revenue from shipments of its Instinct MI308 chips to China. Executives said the same thing last quarter. This time, though, AMD indicated that revenue from those chips could be coming.\"We have received some licenses for MI308, so we're appreciative of the administration supporting some licenses for MI308,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told analysts on a conference call. \"We're still working with our customers on the demand environment and sort of what the overall opportunity is.\"As of Tuesday's close, AMD shares were up 107% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is up 21%.AMD reached a deal with OpenAI last month that could see the AI startup company take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct graphics processing units over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware, the companies said, beginning with an initial 1-gigawatt rollout of chips in the second half of next year.For years OpenAI and other companies relied on graphics chips from Nvidia for running large-scale AI models.\"We expect this partnership will significantly accelerate our data center AI business with the potential to generate well over $100 million in revenue over the next few years,\" Su said. The AI business is on a path toward generating tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027, she said.Also in October, Oracle announced plans to deploy 50,000 AMD Instinct MI450 AI chips in its cloud starting next year.AMD's data center business, which includes standard central processing units and GPUs for AI, generated $4.34 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue, up 22%. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $4.13 billion.Client revenue reached $2.75 billion, which was up 46% and more than StreetAccount's $2.61 billion consensus. Revenue from gaming totaled $1.30 billion, up 181%. StreetAccount's consensus was $1.05 billion.Microsoft and Sony ramped up production of their respective Xbox and PlayStation video game consoles ahead of the holiday season, leading to growth in semi-custom chip revenue for AMD, Su said.Amazon, a key cloud customer for AMD, disclosed in a Tuesday filing that it had sold all 822,234 of its AMD shares as of Sept. 30.

    "body": "watch nowPalantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.\"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"\"He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,\" Karp added.When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.Palantir shares slid 8% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell 4% after gaining over 50% this year.\"I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,\" said Karp of short sellers.Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.\"It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'\" Karp said.The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short\" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.\"With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,\" Karp said. \"We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"",

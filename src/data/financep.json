    "body": "<div><div><p>Recruiters speak to job seekers at the Appalachian State University internship and job fair in Boone, North Carolina, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. </p><p>Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>If it just seems like the first Friday of the month wasn't the same without being able to pore through the Bureau of Labor Statistics' hotly watched monthly jobs report, don't worry. You probably didn't miss much.</p><p>While the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/bls-wont-be-releasing-data-including-fridays-key-jobs-report-in-case-of-a-shutdown.html\">BLS has gone dark</a> with the shutdown in Washington, other reports outside the government data suggest the labor market just plodded along in September.</p><p>The Dow Jones consensus forecast was for growth of 51,000 in nonfarm payrolls with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.3%.</p><p>High-frequency data that includes job postings, private payrolls and state-by-state figures for initial jobless claims indicate that while employment growth continues to be anemic, the labor market overall isn't capsizing, at least not anytime soon.</p><p>\"We fight with the army we have at moments like this, where it's critically important that we're figuring out whether the economy is in a moment of transition,\" Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/fed-goolsbee-rates.html\">said in a CNBC interview</a> Friday. \"This is what we have, and thus far it still continues to point to a pretty stable labor market.\"</p><p>The Chicago Fed is one of those organizations looking to provide alternates to BLS data that had come under harsh White House criticism prior to this week's shutdown.</p><p>Though the timing was coincidental, the central bank district in September unveiled <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/chicago-fed-labor-market-indicators/latest-release\" target=\"_blank\">its own dashboard</a> of data measuring key labor market metrics including unemployment, the hiring rate and the layoff rate.</p><p>Bottom line: The unemployment rate held flat at 4.3%, though another hundredth of a point or two would have pushed it to 4.4% — the highest since October 2021 but still low by historical standards.</p><p>Other nongovernmental data showed similar trends: Conditions overall are softening, with job availability gradually shrinking.</p><p>But employers are still reluctant to part with workers given the lessons from the Covid pandemic, when a rash of layoffs in the early stages was followed by the monumental task of refilling those jobs. At one point, open positions outnumbered available workers by more than 2 to 1.</p><p>\"A lot of the new entrants in the market, young workers, recent graduates, people who are already unemployed [are] having a hard time getting into the market,\" said Cory Stahle, senior economist at job postings site Indeed, which itself provides an encompassing menu of labor market data. \"Regardless of what the unemployment rate is, people taking longer to find jobs is a sign of some economic distress for some households.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Signs of imbalances</h2><div><p>Indeed's <a href=\"https://data.indeed.com/#/\" target=\"_blank\">measure of job postings</a> shows a decline of about 8.9% from a year ago as of Sept. 26, a sharper drop than the 5.5% reflected in BLS data, which only runs through August.</p><p>Broader trends suggest an uneven labor market, with professions like health care continuing to thrive while other fields lag, Stahle said.</p><p>\"Overall, things are looking pretty good, but a lot of those job gains, a lot of those postings and hiring, are coming from health care, and so it's hard to say that the labor market is fully in balance when it's not providing equal opportunities across different occupations,\" he said.</p><p>BLS data also has shown a fairly sizeable tilt in openings toward health care-related professions, with business and professional services next followed by leisure and hospitality. Government had been a leader but has pulled back since President Donald Trump began his term in January with a vow to pare down the federal payroll.</p><p>\"Right now is a good time to be a nurse, not so good of a time to be working as a software developer,\" Stahle added. \"That bifurcation of the labor market is also an important thing to look at here, not just the overall balance and an overall number.\"</p><p>Other indicators paint a similar picture, though <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">ADP's private payroll count</a> for September showed a decline of 32,000 jobs and an August loss of 3,000 as well. ADP on occasion also has been maligned for being incongruent with BLS data. However, the firm's reports are getting a closer look after it signaled a slowdown in the labor market well before the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">BLS marked down its own counts</a> also to show a weak hiring picture.</p><p>It wasn't just the monthly nonfarm payroll account that went missing because of the shutdown: The Labor Department also didn't release its weekly tally of initial jobless claims.</p><p>Goldman Sachs came to the rescue for that metric, figuring that state-level claims data that was filed pointed to a national total of 224,000 — slightly higher than the previous week but largely in line with trends through most of the year.</p></div><h2><a></a>Other measures</h2><div><p>Beyond simple job or payroll count, spending data also can be a useful indirect gauge.</p><p>Bank of America's credit and debit card tracking showed spending on a steady uptick in September. Total card outlays compared to a year ago increased 2.2% for the week ending Sept. 27.</p><p>\"Spending growth remains solid despite soft labor data. We will continue to monitor this dichotomy,\" BofA economist Shruti Mishra said in a client note.</p><p>Similarly, Fiserv's small business index showed annual sales and transactions increased 2.3% in September, reflecting the same pace for the past three months.</p><p>However, other small business indicators show weakness.</p><p>\"Right now we see that there are a lot of firms that have job openings. There are, unfortunately, very few that get filled,\" Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, told CNBC on Friday. \"So plans to fill them are always very optimistic, but when the dust clears, very few jobs actually get created.\"</p></div></div>",

Buffett, who has run Berkshire since 1965, will remain chairman of the board, while Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take over as CEO on Jan. 1, 2026.</p><p>The move was first announced by the 95-year-old Buffett at the end of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, which took many by surprise. Shortly after the initial announcement, Berkshire's board unanimously approved Abel's appointment.</p><p>Buffett, even at his advanced age, has likely stayed active at the conglomerate. Just earlier this week, Berkshire announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/warren-buffett-berkshire-occidental-oxychem.html\">it is acquiring OxyChem</a>, the chemical arm of Occidental Petroleum, in a roughly $9.7 billion all-cash transaction. It marks Berkshire's biggest deal in three years.</p><p>Abel, 63, has been seen as Buffett's heir apparent since Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, publicly identified him as the chosen successor in 2021. He joined the Berkshire orbit when Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in MidAmerican Energy in 1999, and he later became CEO of the energy firm.</p><p>Since 2018, Abel has served as Berkshire's vice chairman for non-insurance operations, overseeing railroad, utilities, energy, manufacturing and retail businesses.</p></div></div>",

Historically, the plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.</p><p>Here's what student loan borrowers need to know about getting into a new repayment plan right now.</p></div><h2><a></a>Delays are 'disruptive to the lives of borrowers'</h2><div><p>As of Aug. 31, there were already <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278527/gov.uscourts.dcd.278527.42.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1,076,266</a> income-driven repayment plan applications pending with the agency, court records show.</p><p>\"It is not surprising that there will be no progress on the IDR backlog during the shutdown, as the staff who work on it aren't considered 'essential,'\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.</p><p>But, Kantrowitz said, \"the failure to clear the backlog is disruptive to the lives of borrowers.\"</p></div><div><p>Many of the borrowers in the backlog are likely trying to switch out of the Biden administration-era SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education, plan. A court struck that program down in February and now borrowers who remain in the SAVE forbearance, which borrowers were placed into during the legal challenges, are seeing interest grow on their debt. (The Trump administration started charging interest as of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/student-loan-interest-free-save-forbearance-ends.html\">Aug. 1</a>.)</p><p>\"Interest has been accruing on their loans, but they have been unable to switch to another plan,\" Kantrowitz said.</p><p>In the meantime, borrowers stuck in the backlog may not be making progress toward loan forgiveness, either under the terms of an IDR plan or through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF offers debt cancellation to certain public servants or non-profit workers after a decade.</p></div><h2><a></a>What borrowers in the backlog can do</h2><p>For now, the best move student loan borrowers stuck in the backlog can do is to salt away the money they would have directed to their payments, Kantrowitz said. That way, you'll have plenty of cash to draw on when the Education Department switches you into another IDR plan and your first bill comes due.</p><blockquote><div><p>This remains a waiting game.</p><div><p>Carolina Rodriguez</p><p>director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>While this waiting period likely doesn't count toward IDR or PSLF forgiveness, when you first applied for an IDR plan, you were supposed to be put into a 60-day administrative forbearance at first, and those two months still do count on your forgiveness timeline, Kantrowitz said.</p><p>\"Our advice to borrowers is to maintain thorough records and monitor any applications submitted during this period,\" said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program, speaking about the backlog.</p><p>\"Once processing resumes, it's important to follow up promptly to ensure their application remains on track,\" Rodriguez said. \"Beyond that, unfortunately, this remains a waiting game.\"</p></div></div>",

The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.</p><p>In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1973101319222165785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973101319222165785%7Ctwgr%5E6bb1e8bac213d47b901b22d6ba65042b371c9caf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstpost.com%2Fexplainers%2Felon-musk-netflix-boycott-charlie-kirk-controversy-13938760.html\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show's creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said \"mocked\" the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Steele responded to Musk's callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, \"It's probably going to be a very odd day.\" Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called \"Dead End\" a \"brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.\"</p><p>Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is \"hateful to White Americans.\" Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, \"No one should give this woke company another dime.\"</p><p>Netflix did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206766-17593554481759355445-41906018363-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759355447&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"‘Fast Money’ traders talk Netflix shares dropping after Elon Musk tells people to cancel\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for.</p><p>Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year.</p><p>Shares lost nearly 5% over the week. </p><p>\"Is that going to move the needle necessarily? ... You're going to see people sign up on the back of that to counter it,\" CNBC contributor Guy Adami said Wednesday on \"Fast Money.\"</p><p>\"I don't think this is a reason to sell the stock,\" he added.</p><p>Wedbush Securities' Alicia Reese told CNBC that the comments came too late in the third quarter to make any meaningful impact on subscriber counts.</p><p>Still, she said she believes the backlash won't make a major dent and that any impact will be offset by an increase in ad revenue.</p><p>\"Their numbers should come out just fine,\" Reese said. \"I think that shares haven't been hit too hard.\"</p><p>Seymour Asset Management's Tim Seymour said though a day of headlines may move the stock around, Netflix shares are ultimately too expensive to be significantly affected by internet backlash.</p><p>\"We've had these moments in time where, whether it was an ad campaign that went wrong or whether it was some sense that a company was aligned in a particular political channel... I don't think that that's going to be the reason to sell Netflix here,\" Seymour said Wednesday.</p><p>The calls for a boycott mirror those against <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD/\">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a><span><span></span></span></span> in 2023 after it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/bud-light-beer-sales-trail-modelo-in-may-following-anti-lgbtq-backlash.html\">released</a> an ad campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. But the boycott of Bud Light, CNBC contributor Karen Finerman noted on Wednesday, yielded \"far greater\" destruction than any other recent examples.</p><p>\"I feel like this will be very fleeting,\" Finerman said.</p></div></div>",

We need to watch this, as we're about to head into earnings season, and the bulls could run into serious trouble if the Fed doesn't take action,\" he said. \"For my money, the economy away from the data center buildout is getting weaker. This is no time for indecision — the Fed needs to cut.\"</p><p>Monday brings earnings from beer maker <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/STZ/\">Constellation Brands</a><span><span></span></span></span>, and Cramer noted the stock has fallen out of favor on Wall Street along with other alcohol companies. He also mentioned that some of Constellation Brands' products, including Modelo and Corona, are popular among Hispanic consumers — who the company said have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/modelo-owner-constellation-says-trump-immigration-policy-hitting-beer-sales.html\">pulled back</a> due to concerns about President Donald Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses.</p><p>On Tuesday, Cramer said he will be paying attention to McCormick's quarterly report. He said the spice maker is usually reliable, but that reliability hasn't been enough \"to move the needle for this stock\" as the whole packaged food sector sees weakness. However, he added that McCormick may be able to do well in a slower economy \"because spices are excellent trade down material.\" Cramer said he thinks Dell's Tuesday analyst meeting will be a highlight of the week, noting that the tech company has been working with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> to integrate artificial intelligence.</p><p>Wednesday brings an investor day from Solstice, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HON/\">Honeywell</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s materials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/honeywell-sets-date-for-solstice-spinoff-what-it-means-for-shareholders.html\">spinoff</a> company.

Cramer wondered how the soda maker will react to an activist investor who has taken a big stake in the company and wants to make changes, noting that PepsiCo already faces issues as the popularity of GLP-1 weight loss drugs grows and consumers become more health conscious. Cramer called Delta a \"tough stock\" to own,<strong> </strong>as it's down around 5% year-to-date even though it's among the best performers in its sector. Cramer said he's feeling good about Levi's quarter, saying the company has become fairly reliable despite tariffs.</p><p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee<strong> </strong>will speak on Friday, and Cramer said his commentary matters because he's a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee. Cramer pointed out that Goolsbee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/fed-goolsbee-rates.html\">told CNBC</a> on Friday that he's wary of cutting interest rates too quickly because of inflation.

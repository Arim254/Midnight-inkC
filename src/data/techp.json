    "body": "\nChris Sacca’s venture firm Lowercarbon Capital is raising a second fund to back nuclear fusion energy hopefuls, the VC said at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg.  \nThe firm has backed leading fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems, as well as others like Pacific Fusion. It raised a $250 million, fusion-geared fund in 2022. Fusion believers, who include a number of well-known climate VCs beyond Sacca (like Vinod Khosla), still hold faith that a breakthrough needed to make it commercially viable is just around the corner. And several advances are showing promise of delivering one.\nIn the meantime, building fusion reactors is expensive. Commonwealth raised $863 million earlier this year, after raising a $1.8 billion Series B four years ago. TechCrunch has documented a dozen fusion startups that have raised over $100 million. \nSacca didn’t say how big this second fund will be, but a source told Bloomberg that it’s intended to be bigger than the first. \n"

The project will buy farmland in the Amazon and reforest it.\nThe deal was made through the Symbiosis Coalition, an advance market commitment intended to develop a market for nature-based carbon removal schemes that is backed by Google, McKinsey, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce. Symbiosis Coalition is similar to Frontier, an advance market commitment also backed by Google and others that supports direct air capture projects.\nNature-based carbon removal shows great promise in drawing down CO2 levels in the atmosphere, but projects have been challenging to develop and sell for a variety of reasons. Nature-based projects risk falling short of their goals if they’re damaged by wildfires or other disasters, and it can be challenging to guarantee their long-term viability.\nStill, they come with many upsides: Forests can replenish aquifers and support biodiversity, neither of which direct air capture can do. Google said it will use its DeepMind Perch AI to help quantify biodiversity benefits of the project.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n"

In a Vanity Fair interview, Kim Kardashian — who has been studying to become a lawyer — discussed her “toxic” friendship with ChatGPT, admitting that she has failed law exams after it told her false information.\n“I use [ChatGPT] for legal advice, so when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I will take a picture and snap it and put it in there,” she said. “They’re always wrong. It has made me fail tests… And then I’ll get mad and I’ll yell at it and be like, ‘You made me fail!’” \nChatGPT is prone to hallucinations, meaning that the LLM will create fake answers sometimes, rather than admit that it cannot confidently respond to a prompt. This technology isn’t necessarily programmed to know what information is “correct” or not — rather, it is trained on an unfathomably massive heap of data and prompted to predict the most likely response to an input, which may not be factually accurate. Some lawyers have been sanctioned for using ChatGPT when writing legal briefs, which becomes obvious to those reviewing the briefs, since they cite cases that don’t exist.\nKardashian said she will try to appeal to ChatGPT’s emotions after it lets her down — but this is a futile plan, since ChatGPT does not have feelings.\n“I will talk to it and say, ‘Hey, you’re going to make me fail, how does that make you feel that you need to really know these answers?’” she said. “And then it’ll say back to me, ‘This is just teaching you to trust your own instincts.’”\nBut while ChatGPT may not have feelings, that doesn’t mean that we — human beings — don’t have feelings about it. \n“I screenshot all the time and send it to my group chat, like, ‘Can you believe this b—- is talking to me like this?’”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

These fraudulent ads purport to offer a product or service that isn’t real and may be intended to solicit payments from less savvy users.\nImage Credits:Facebook (Screenshot by Reuters)\nMeta has a system for detecting the likelihood that an advertising campaign is a scam, but the company only deactivates an advertiser’s account if it is 95% sure that the advertiser is committing fraud.

Per Reuters’ report, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone claimed that the documents Reuters used “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams.”\nStone added that over the last 18 months, Meta has reduced user reports of scam ads by 58%, and the company has removed over 134 million scam ads from its platforms.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

    "body": "\nGrand Theft Auto VI, one of the most anticipated video games of all time, has been delayed, again — this time until November 19, 2026.\nThe game was initially slated for a fall 2025 release but was pushed back to May 2026. On Thursday, Rockstar Games announced that the development team needs another six months.\n“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar Games wrote in their statement.\nGrand Theft Auto VI is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto V, which was released in 2013. According to Guinness World Records, that game became the fastest entertainment property to reach $1 billion in sales, hitting the milestone after just three days on the market. Fans are so eager for the next installment in the franchise that when Rockstar Games released the trailer for the game in December 2023, it broke the record for the most YouTube views in 24 hours (excluding music videos).\nRockstar Games did not provide additional details about the delay. Last week, the company fired between 30 and 40 employees for allegedly sharing confidential information in a Discord server.\n"

In a lengthy post on X on Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly clarified the totals.\n“We expect to end this year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030. We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years,” he wrote.\nWhile the post was largely a response to a brouhaha over comments his CFO made, and quickly walked back, concerning government-backstopped loans, Altman also listed a number of future business plans he believes will generate significant revenue.\nHe said OpenAI has an upcoming enterprise offering. Earlier this week, OpenAI said it already had a million business customers.\nHe named consumer devices and robotics. In May, OpenAI acquired Jony Ive’s io, and they are reportedly working on a palm-sized AI device.\nAltman mentioned scientific discovery as an upcoming business. Not much is known about it yet, except that OpenAI VP Kevin Weil mentioned a newly launched OpenAI for Science some months ago.\nAltman also said OpenAI could become a cloud computing provider: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of ‘AI cloud’, and we are excited to offer this.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat’s a bold idea for a company that doesn’t yet have its own network of data centers.\nBeyond revenue, Altman noted that the company may also pay for its needs the old-fashioned way: selling more equity or taking on more loans.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

In exchange, the recipients pledge to produce some final work product, whether it’s a startup, an open-source codebase, or another type of artifact.\nThe initial cohort is fifteen projects, with a particular focus on the difficult problem of AI evaluation. Some of those projects will be familiar to TechCrunch readers, including the command-line coding benchmark Terminal Bench and the latest version of the long-running ARC-AGI project.\nOthers take a fresh approach to a long-established evaluation problem. Formula Code, built by researchers at CalTech and UT Austin, aims to produce an evaluation of AI agents’ ability to optimize existing code, while the Columbia-based BizBench proposes a comprehensive benchmark for “white-collar AI agents.” Other grants explore new structures for reinforcement learning or model compression.\nSWE-Bench co-founder John Boda Yang is also part of the cohort, as leader of the new CodeClash project. Inspired by the success of SWE-Bench, CodeClash will assess code through a dynamic competition-based framework, which Yang hopes will make the results more comprehensive.\n“I do think people continuing to evaluate on core third-party benchmarks drives progress,” Yang told TechCrunch. “I’m a little bit worried about a future where benchmarks just become specific to companies.” \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nOn Friday, Amazon announced the debut of Amazon Bazaar, a new low-cost shopping destination for Asia, Africa, and Latin America that will be available separately from the main Amazon shopping app. On Bazaar, most products are available under $10, and some are as low as $2, the retailer says.\nThe product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that’s available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria.\nAmazon says more markets will gain access to the app in the months ahead.\nThe app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. Haul operates as part of Amazon’s main website and app, and will remain available in its existing markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.\nIn other markets, Amazon had already branded Amazon Haul as Bazaar, where it’s been available through Amazon’s main shopping app. That version also remains available in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to India. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names “better resonate with local language preferences and cultures.”)\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items.\nThe Bazaar app will offer these users “hundreds of thousands” of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nCustomers use their same Amazon credentials to shop and check out, where they can use Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Orders will have to meet the local minimum purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. (This varies by market.) For smaller orders, a standard delivery fee is charged. \nShipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese.\nThe app will also engage customers with interactive features like social lucky draws and promotions — things popularized by the Chinese shopping apps. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

According to the Post, CBO officials are worried that the hackers accessed internal emails and chat logs, as well as communications between lawmakers’ offices and CBO researchers. \nReuters reported that the Senate Sergeant at Arms office, the Senate’s law enforcement agency, notified congressional offices of a breach, warning them that emails between CBO and the offices could have been compromised and used to craft and send phishing attacks. \nIt’s unclear how the hackers gained access to the CBO’s network. But soon after news of the breach became public, security researcher Kevin Beaumont wrote on Bluesky that he suspected hackers may have exploited the CBO’s outdated Cisco firewall to break into the agency’s network.  \nLast month, Beaumont noted that CBO had a Cisco ASA firewall on its network that was last patched in 2024.

    "body": "\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton late on Thursday said he is suing online gaming platform Roblox over child safety concerns, accusing the company of “deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform.”\nIn a statement, Paxton alleged that Roblox chooses to prioritize “pixel pedophiles” and profit over the safety of children, and said the platform has become a “breeding ground for predators.”\n“We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators,” Paxton said. “Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law.”\nPaxton’s lawsuit follows similar cases by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Kentucky, as well as multiple cases in California, Texas, and Pennsylvania against Roblox. The company has come under fire repeatedly for not implementing adequate child safety measures and exposing minors to dangers like grooming, explicit content, and violent or abusive material.\nIn light of such cases and investigations, governments around the world have been rolling out increasingly strict laws and regulations that require social platforms to verify users’ ages, like the U.K.’s Online Safety Act and Mississippi’s age-assurance law. Other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia, are also considering similar laws.\nThe company has so far responded by adding a slew of safety features, including an age-estimation system that scans users’ selfies and analyzes facial features to estimate age, standardized content and maturity labels, an AI system to detect early signals of child endangerment, safeguards for teenagers, content controls, and more. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when a large number of users are breaking its rules.\nRoblox had 151.5 million daily active users as of September 30, 2025.\nRoblox said it has implemented “industry-leading protocols” to protect users and address malicious activity, and noted that it is “disappointed” by the lawsuit. “We are disappointed that, rather than working collaboratively with Roblox on this industry-wide challenge and seeking real solutions, the AG has chosen to file a lawsuit based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n“Roblox is deeply committed to child safety. Our policies are purposefully stricter than those found on many other platforms. We prohibit the sharing of images and videos in chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information and our trained teams and automated tools continuously monitor communications to detect and remove harmful content,” the spokesperson said.\nNote: This story was updated to add Roblox’s comments.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.\nMusk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.” \n“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said. \nRevealing the production version of the new Roadster next year is in itself a delay. Just one week ago he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and repeated his claim that he wanted to show off the car by year’s end. \nMusk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.\nMusk went on to say that he believes the second-generation Roadster won’t go into production until 12 to 18 months after the April reveal. \nDuring the Q&A portion of the meeting, one shareholder asked Musk if customers who preordered the “Founders Series” version of the new Roadsters could be invited to the reveal event. Those were the customers who plopped down $250,000 to secure special versions of the car in 2017.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Sure, absolutely,” Musk answered. “It’s the least we can do for our long-suffering Roadster reservation holders.”\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of those long-time sufferers who recently attempted to cancel the reservation — and initially failed to get a refund — for the long-promised EV.\nEarlier this month, Altman posted on X a “tale in three acts,” which was comprised of several screenshots showing his initial reservation, a request for a refund of the $50,000 reservation fee, and his email bouncing back.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nMusk, who has openly sparred with Altman for years, went on the attack. “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSecurity researchers have discovered an Android spyware that targeted Samsung Galaxy phones during a nearly year-long hacking campaign.\nResearchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 said the spyware, which they call “Landfall,” was first detected in July 2024 and relied on exploiting a security flaw in the Galaxy phone software that was unknown to Samsung at the time, a type of vulnerability known as a zero-day. \nUnit 42 said the flaw could be abused by sending a maliciously crafted image to a victim’s phone, likely delivered through a messaging app, and that the attacks may not have required any interaction from the victim. \nSamsung patched the security flaw — tracked as CVE-2025-21042 — in April 2025, but details of the spyware campaign abusing the flaw have not been previously reported.\nThe researchers said in a blog post that it’s not known which surveillance vendor developed the Landfall spyware, nor is it known how many individuals were targeted as part of the campaign. But the researchers said that the attacks likely targeted individuals in the Middle East.\nItay Cohen, a senior principal researcher at Unit 42, told TechCrunch that the hacking campaign consisted of a “precision attack” on specific individuals and not a mass-distributed malware, which indicates that the attacks were likely driven by espionage.\nUnit 42 found that the Landfall spyware shares overlapping digital infrastructure used by a known surveillance vendor dubbed Stealth Falcon, which has been previously seen in spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents as far back as 2012. But the researchers said that the links with Stealth Falcon, while intriguing, were not enough to clearly attribute the attacks to a particular government customer.\nUnit 42 said that the Landfall spyware samples that they discovered had been uploaded to VirusTotal, a malware scanning service, from individuals in Morocco, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey throughout 2024 and early 2025.\nTurkey’s national cyber readiness team, known as USOM, flagged one of the IP addresses that the Landfall spyware connected to as malicious, which Unit 42 said supports the theory that individuals in Turkey may have been targeted.\nMuch like other government spyware, Landfall is capable of broad device surveillance, such as accessing the victim’s data, including photos, messages, contacts, and call logs, as well as the tapping of the device’s microphone and tracking their precise location.\nUnit 42 found that the spyware’s source code referenced five specific Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S22, S23, S24, and some Z models, as targets. Cohen said that the vulnerability may have also been present on other Galaxy devices, and affected Android versions 13 through 15. \nSamsung did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAccel has invested in Rapido, the ride-hailing platform competing with Uber in India, while Prosus has increased its stake, after Indian two-wheeler giant TVS Motor sold its entire holding.\nOn Thursday, TVS Motor said in a stock exchange filing (PDF) that it has sold its entire stake in Rapido for ₹2.88 billion (about $32 million) to Accel and Prosus’ investment unit, MIH Investments, securing a return of more than 152% over the past three years.\nFounded in 2015, Rapido has grown into a major player in India’s ride-hailing market, competing with Uber, Ola, and inDrive. The company began with bike taxis before expanding into auto-rickshaw bookings and car services and has added courier services to its platform. It has more recently been piloting a food-delivery service in select cities, entering a segment dominated by Swiggy and Zomato.\nTVS Motor first invested in Rapido in April 2022 as part of the company’s $180 million Series D round, joining existing backers such as WestBridge Capital, Shell Ventures, and Nexus Venture Partners. The automaker bought its stake at that time for ₹1.14 billion, according to its earlier investor disclosures (PDF).\nAs part of the latest transaction, Accel purchased 11,997 preference shares in Rapido, while Prosus acquired 11,988 preference shares and 10 equity shares. Both investors paid about ₹1.44 billion (roughly $16 million) each.\nAccel’s backing of Rapido marks a return to India’s ride-hailing sector for the firm, which was an early investor in Ola. The move comes as Rapido is in talks with Accel and Prosus for a new primary funding round that could close next year, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to TechCrunch. The exact funding size has yet to be determined.\nProsus is already an investor in Rapido and expanded its stake through another secondary share sale in September, when Swiggy sold its entire holding. That transaction doubled Rapido’s valuation to $2.3 billion, TechCrunch reported.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccel and Prosus are also early backers of Swiggy, which exited Rapido after citing a potential conflict of interest, as the ride-hailing startup prepared to expand into the food-delivery market.\nAccel and Prosus did not respond to requests for comment. Rapido could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon announced on Thursday the launch of Kindle Translate, an AI-powered translation service designed for authors using Kindle Direct Publishing to broaden their reach. The service initially translates text between English and Spanish and from German to English, as it’s still operating in beta. More languages will be supported over time.\nThe retail giant noted less than 5% of titles on Amazon are available in more than one language, suggesting there’s a big opportunity for AI translations.\nOf course, AI isn’t perfect, which means it could introduce errors into the text. To address this, Amazon allows authors to preview their translations before publishing if desired. If the author is not using the service to simply speed up translating their work into another language they speak, this ability to check the AI’s work won’t do them much good; they’d still need a human translator to review the AI output if they wanted to ensure the best accuracy.\n(Amazon claims its AI translations are “automatically evaluated for accuracy” before publication, but it doesn’t detail what steps are involved with this part of the process.)\nThe company says authors can manage and access their translations from the Kindle Direct Publishing portal, where they can choose the languages, set prices, and publish their translated work.\nReaders, meanwhile, will see AI-translated works clearly labeled as “Kindle Translate” titles and will be able to preview samples of the translation. \nKindle Translate competes with many other AI-powered translation services and tools on the market, whose pricing can vary and which offer broader support for more languages. There are also open source tools. Some people in the industry criticize the use of AI in this way, saying that human translators are better at capturing nuance — particularly in fiction and other literary works. But AI is improving on this front and will likely continue to get better over time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAt present, Kindle’s translation service is being offered for free, according to Amazon’s announcement, which quotes an early tester who praised this aspect of the service, saying that indie authors have struggled to find a “cost-effective and trustworthy solution.”\nAmazon says translations are eligible to be enrolled in other programs, like KDP Select, and are included in its Kindle Unlimited subscription service. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

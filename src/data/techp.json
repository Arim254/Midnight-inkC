Officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA, sought to determine if there was any harm to government security as a result of his uploads.\nUploading unclassified but internal government documents to a public version of a large language model is problematic, as it allows the model to train itself on that information, potentially allowing its contents to be shared with others who use it.\nA CISA spokesperson told Politico that Gottumukkala’s use of ChatGPT was “short-term and limited.”\nPrior to his appointment at CISA, Gottumukkala served as the chief information officer of South Dakota under then-governor Kristi Noem. Following his appointment to CISA, Gottumukkala reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph, which Homeland Security later claimed was “unsanctioned,” and subsequently suspended six career staff from accessing classified information.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Security\n\n"

    "body": "\nGoogle is expanding its push into AI-powered learning by adding full-length practice tests in Gemini for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), India’s nationwide engineering  exam used to shortlist candidates for the country’s top technical institutes and taken by millions of students each year.\nGoogle said students can take full-length mock exams for the JEE within Gemini, which will offer questions based on vetted content from Indian education firms PhysicsWallah and Careers360. \nThe launch comes after the company recently rolled out similar test-prep tools for the SAT.\nOnce students complete a mock test in Gemini, Google said the chatbot will provide immediate feedback, highlighting areas of strength and where further study is needed. It can also explain correct answers and help students generate a customized study plan based on their performance, the company said.\nThe launch of practice tests in Gemini signals a broader push to position the chatbot as a tool for structured exam preparation rather than a shortcut to answers. \nIn addition to Gemini, Google said the JEE Main preparation tools will roll out to AI Mode in Search, including the Canvas tool, which allows students to build study guides and interactive quizzes by attaching their class notes.\nGoogle claims Indian students are using Gemini to study subjects ranging from advanced physics to broader STEM topics, as well as NotebookLM for turning study materials into quizzes, flashcards and audio or video summaries. Google’s AI tools are available in multiple Indian languages.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said it is also expanding its focus on Indian educators, and plans to work with government agencies on a nationwide program to help teachers and support staff use AI for administrative work and lesson design.\nThe company said it is partnering with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, and Chaudhary Charan Singh University on a pilot to build an “AI-enabled state university.” The project aims to create a national framework for applying AI across vocational and higher education, encompassing teaching and student support, as well as administrative operations.\nAdditionally, the company said its charitable arm, Google.org, is backing Wadhwani AI with an ₹850 million (about $10 million) grant to integrate AI into government-run education platforms. The initiative targets systems such as national online learning portals and state education platforms, aiming to make them more adaptable and reduce administrative burdens for educators.\nThe program spans pre-school through higher education, and includes tools such as voice-based reading support in multiple Indian languages, and AI-powered English learning coaches. The company claims it has already reached around 10 million learners and educators, and aims to scale to 75 million students, 1.8 million educators, and a million early-career professionals by the end of 2027.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon said today that it is cutting 16,000 jobs across the company. This reduction comes after the e-commerce company laid off 14,000 people in October.\nIn a letter to employees, Senior VP of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, said that these layoffs were made for “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.” She noted that the reason for the second round of massive layoffs within three months was that several teams in the company hadn’t finished their restructuring.\nGaletti didn’t outright deny that there might be more job slashes in the company, but said that the company is not trying to create a pattern of large layoffs every few months.\n“Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate,” she said in a blog post. \nIn October, Amazon said that it had 1.57 million employees, and had registered single-digit growth in the past five quarters prior to that, according to the company’s Q3 2025 filings. The company is set to publish its Q4 2025 results next week. \nIn its latest blog post, Galetti said that despite these job cuts, the company will continue to hire in strategic areas. \nLast year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a memo that said because of AI, the company will need fewer people “doing some ofthe jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” He also indicated that the company’s corporate workforce will see a reduction in the next few years. \nAmazon sent an erroneous meeting invite to numerous AWS employees that addressed job cuts and a “Project Dawn” initiative, confusing workers, as reported by Business Insider. The invite was canceled shortly after. \nOn Tuesday, Amazon said that it is closing its physical Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh Stores to concentrate on increasing capacity for same-day grocery delivery. The company instead plans to expand Whole Foods’ footprint and open 100 new stores over the next few years. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOne way to track the speed of the AI boom is to follow the hardware supply chain. Nvidia is the classic example: As AI companies build out data centers, they’re buying up billions of dollars of GPUs each month, turning Nvidia into the most valuable company on earth. But Nvidia has suppliers too, and looking at them can give us an even longer-term view of the market.\nThat’s why we care about ASML, a Dutch photolithography company that has become a key linchpin for the semiconductor industry. ASML is the sole supplier of the EUV equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips, making it a central supplier for the entire industry. When ASML does well, it’s because companies are expecting to sell a lot of semiconductors. \nAnd based on the quarterly earnings released Wednesday morning, the company is doing very well indeed.\nThe topline figure is 32.7 billion euros in net sales, which is a lot of money by any standards. But for our purposes, the most important figure is “new bookings,” which represent the new orders that came in this quarter. Looking at those orders tells us how much capacity chip manufacturers think they’ll need, based on the orders they expect from data center buildouts in the years to come.\nBy that metric, the AI infrastructure boom is still going strong. Last quarter, ASML brought in 13 billion euros worth of new orders, a new record for the company and more than double the orders that came in the quarter before.\nIn an earnings statement, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet made it clear the extra demand was coming from AI. \n“In the last months, many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation, primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand,” Fouquet wrote. In non-CEO English, that means their customers expect AI labs will really need all the data centers they’re building, and they’re spending money now so they can be ready to supply the chips.\nTo be clear: none of this is guaranteed to happen. The future is unwritten! It may be years before all those orders are filled, and some clients may pull out before delivery time. The dreaded Zitron predictions could still come true and bring it all crashing down.\nBut if you were waiting for companies to back-pedal on the trillions of dollars in projected infrastructure spending…you may be waiting for a while.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Samsung said that it is using a mix of hardware and software to achieve its results.\nAn online tipster who goes by the name of Ice Universe posted screenshots on X about the feature, showing how the notification area blanks out at an angle.

    "body": "\nLater this year, Snap is expected to launch the latest consumer version of its AR glasses, Specs. In anticipation of that big event, the company has launched a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., focused solely on further developing the glasses.\nSnap announced the new company on Tuesday, explaining that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment” as it continues to iterate on its product. It shows that, like other tech giants (see: Meta and Apple), Snap is getting serious about its smart glasses—although it’s worth noting that the company has been developing its AR hardware for quite a long time.\nIn fact, Snap originally began working on the technology behind Specs over a decade ago, although the last time the company offered a consumer version of the glasses was in 2018. Since 2024, the latest version of the hardware (technically its fifth generation) has been a developer-only product, which has allowed Snap to work on populating the wearable with the kinds of programs that will hopefully make it a hit when it comes time to launch.\nAs Snap has continued to refine its product, other companies have charged to the front of the AR glasses race, most notably Meta—which has cut deals with major eyewear companies (Ray Ban and Oakley via its partnership with those brands’ owner, EssilorLuxottica) while enjoying growing demand in the U.S. Snap obviously hopes to make a meaningful entrance into that market once its glasses are released later this year.\nAt CES earlier this month, I met up with Russell Patton, product manager for Specs, who gave me the opportunity to demo Snap’s new headgear. Patton, who guided me through a tour of the device’s user experience and latest features, said that “the spatial nature” of Specs meant that there were a lot of user experiences that could be enjoyed that aren’t possible with a phone. That spatial experience is largely powered by the glasses’ four cameras, which allow for hand tracking and enable the company’s Snap Spatial Engine, which is the software component that projects the device’s AR imagery.\nSpecs run on a distinct operating system, Snap OS, which released its latest version last September. The newest version notably includes an improved browser (which I was able to test-drive by visiting the TechCrunch website), as well as an AI-powered function (dubbed “spatial tips”) that can provide auto-generated information about whatever you happen to be looking at (while staring at a table full of snacks, the glasses gave me tips for which were the healthiest). Also included is a “travel mode,” which Snap says can help travelers translate foreign street signs and menus.\nThen there are the games. During my demo, I managed to flail my way through a round of Avatar: The Last Airbender, which was quite a lot of fun. The headsets also have the ability to synchronize with one another, meaning that two different people wearing different sets of glasses can see the same thing in the same physical space. As you might imagine, that opens the door for collaborative gaming.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe form factor of the glasses I used was a bit cumbersome (at nearly 8 ounces, they’re a bit heavy), and it had a propensity to heat up after usage, although the team told me that the particular pair of glasses I was using had been in use all day. The physical makeup of the hardware is also expected to change before it launches publicly.\nThe company hasn’t provided a firm release date yet, so interested consumers will have to keep their eyes peeled for that announcement. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nAs the nuclear power gold rush enters into full swing — spurred by AI companies’ desperate need for electricity —  the sellers of “picks and shovels” are starting to cash in, too.\nBy the end of 2025, nuclear startups had raised $1.1 billion, all for small modular reactors. The deal flow is now extending to those critical suppliers in the nuclear industry. And Standard Nuclear, which makes nuclear fuel to feed those reactors, is one of them. \nThe company said it has raised $140 million in a Series A round led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Chevron Technology Ventures, Crucible Capital, Fundomo, StepStone Group, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, and XTX Ventures.\nThe round was completed in two tranches of $70 million each after Standard Nuclear hit milestones sooner than expected in the wake of President Donald Trump’s nuclear-related executive orders last year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. \nThe new round comes seven months after Standard Nuclear emerged from “stealth” with $42 million in funding. Air quotes are required here; Standard Nuclear is built on the ashes of the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), which went bankrupt in October 2024. The bankrupt company had been working to commercialize a nuclear fuel called TRi-structural ISOtropic particle fuel, or TRISO, for years. Decisive Point’s founder, Thomas Hendrix, bought USNC’s fuel-related assets in the bankruptcy auction for $28 million.\nTRISO fuel was originally conceptualized in the 1950s. Uranium particles about the size of a poppy seed are coated in ceramic and carbon. Those are then packed into larger spheres. Altogether, the design of the fuel pellets is supposed to be more resistant to melting down.\nTRISO isn’t widely used today. And yet, many nuclear startups say they’ll be using TRISO in their reactors. Standard Nuclear has said it has $100 million in non-binding sales for 2027. Its customers include Radiant Energy, another Decisive Point portfolio company, and Nano Nuclear Energy, which bought USNC’s reactor assets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStandard Nuclear’s years of experience could put it in the lead. But if nuclear startups can’t deliver large numbers of reactors on the timelines they’ve promised — they all face steep challenges in scaling manufacturing — Standard Nuclear could, just like its predecessor, find itself too far ahead of the puck.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nShadowfax stumbled in its market debut, with shares falling as investors weighed concerns about the logistics firm’s heavy reliance on a handful of large e-commerce clients. The company raised about ₹19.07 billion (about $208.24 million) in its initial public offering.\nThe shares fell about 9% from the offer price of ₹124 to ₹112.60 on Wednesday, valuing the Bengaluru-based logistics firm at roughly ₹64.7 billion (about $706.58 million) on debut, roughly matching its last private valuation of close to ₹60 billion (roughly $655.01 million) in early 2025. The offering, priced in a band of ₹118–124 per share, combined a fresh issue with an offer-for-sale by existing shareholders and was subscribed nearly three times over.\nFounded in 2015, Shadowfax operates as a third-party logistics provider, handling last-mile and intra-city deliveries for e-commerce marketplaces, quick-commerce platforms and consumer internet companies across India. The company counts e-commerce players including Flipkart and Meesho, as well as quick-commerce and food delivery platforms Zepto and Zomato, among its largest clients, which together account for about 74% of its revenue, according to its prospectus. Its key shareholders include Flipkart, TPG NewQuest, Qualcomm, and the World Bank-backed International Finance Corporation.\nShadowfax’s listing comes as the e-commerce and quick-commerce sectors continue to expand in India, driven by rising internet penetration, urbanization, and demand for faster deliveries. Platforms offering same-day or rapid fulfillment have increasingly leaned on third-party logistics providers to scale nationally, placing companies like Shadowfax at the centre of the country’s consumer internet supply chain.\nThe offering includes shares sold by some early and institutional backers, including Flipkart, Eight Roads Ventures, Nokia Growth Partners, Qualcomm, and Mirae Asset. Founders Abhishek Bansal and Vaibhav Khandelwal are not participating in the offer-for-sale and will together retain about 20% of the company after listing.\n“We don’t see this IPO as a destination,” said Bansal, Shadowfax’s co-founder and CEO, during its IPO launch ceremony in Mumbai. “We are not building this for the next quarter. We are building this for the next century. Today, we don’t ring a bell. We are waking up to a new set of possibilities.”\nIn the six months ended September 2025, Shadowfax reported revenue from operations of ₹18.06 billion (about $197.12 million), up 68% from the same period a year earlier, per its prospectus. The company’s profit more than doubled year over year to ₹210.37 million (around $2.30 million), reflecting higher delivery volumes, though earnings remain closely tied to demand from a small group of large platform clients.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nShadowfax plans to use proceeds from the fresh issue to fund capital expenditure for its network infrastructure, pay lease costs for new first-mile, last-mile and sorting centres, and meet branding, marketing and communication expenses, its prospectus said. A portion of the proceeds will also be kept for inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nThe company currently operates around 3.5 million square feet of logistics infrastructure across 14,700 pin codes nationwide.\nShadowfax’s IPO comes more than three years after its larger rival, Delhivery, went public in 2022. Delhivery reported revenue of about ₹89.3 billion (around $974.84 million) in the year ended March 2025, with year-over-year growth in the low teens, underscoring the contrast with Shadowfax’s faster expansion.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAnduril founder Palmer Luckey’s eyes light up, and he talks a mile a minute, when discussing his company’s new recruiting event: the AI Grand Prix. \nThis is a drone-flying contest with a twist. Rather than humans operating drones, the drones must operate autonomously. The humans will be tested on their software-writing skills that cause the drones to outfly their competition.  \nThere are prizes ranging from a $500,000 pot to be spilt amongst the highest-scoring teams, to jobs at Anduril and a chance to bypass the company’s standard recruiting cycle. \n“It was something that I decided we should do,” Luckey said in an interview with TechCrunch. Luckey and the team were meeting to discuss recruitment strategy, he recalled.\nSomeone suggested sponsoring a drone-racing tournament, which was somewhat in line with the company’s previous marketing tactics. For instance, Anduril sponsors the NASCAR Cup Series race known as the Anduril 250. \nLuckey generally liked the idea but then told the team, “‘Guys, that would be a really dumb thing for Anduril to sponsor. The whole point, our entire impetus and reason for being, is this pitch that autonomy has finally advanced to where you don’t have to have a person micromanaging each drone,’” he recalled, then added, “‘What we should really do is sponsor a race that’s about how well programmers and engineers can make a drone fly itself.’” \nAfter discovering that such an event didn’t exist, the company opted to create it themselves. Interestingly, though, Luckey pointed out that the teams in the AI Grand Prix will not be flying Anduril’s drones, but those built by another defense tech startup: Neros Technologies. According to Luckey, Anduril’s drones are too physically big to run in the contained course in Ohio where the finals will take place.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We talked about having teams use Anduril drones, but Anduril doesn’t make any drones that are of the ultra-high speed, very small nature that you would want for a Drone Racing League. It’s mostly bigger stuff,” he said.  \nAnduril is also partnering with one of the established racing leagues, the Drone Champions League, to operate the event, as well as JobsOhio. The final race will take place in Ohio (where Anduril’s key manufacturing facility is located). \nAlthough Luckey is clearly excited about how fun the event will be, he won’t be a racer himself. “I absolutely will be there,” he says, but “it’s going to be about who can build the best software to pilot these drones.”  \nHe smiled and said, “I’m not actually a very good software programmer. I’m more of a hardware guy. I’m an electromechanical and optical guy, and I know just enough about coding to glue stuff together in a way that works for my prototypes.”  \n(Luckey calls Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf “our de facto lead software brains” at the company.) \nThe founder is hoping for at least 50 teams, and already has interest from multiple universities, he said. Should this competition be a successful event, the plan is to expand it into races with the other types of autonomous vehicles.\n“We are starting with these quadcopter racing drones, which is what people expect from drone racing. However, we want to be, in the future, applying AI racing to other platforms as well,” he said.  \nUnderwater AI racing, ground AI racing, potentially even AI racing of spacecraft were some of the ideas Luckey shared.\nThe contest is open to all international entrants, excluding teams from Russia.  \n“The difference with Russia is they are actively engaged in the act of invading Europe,” he said. \nThe concern is that the people qualified to enter such a race may also be working for their nation’s military. “I would love to have everybody, but we’re not the Olympics,” he added.\nLuckey said the event was following the lead from the World Cup, which has also excluded Russia. \nInterestingly, teams from China (home to a lot of autonomous engineering) are welcome, despite it being the country that U.S. autonomous weapons hawks often name as their biggest fear.\nShould a Chinese team win, the prize of a job at Anduril, which makes weapons used by the U.S. military, would not be a given. “If you work for the Chinese military, you’re not going to be allowed to get a job at Anduril,” Luckey said. Certain laws apply, he pointed out. In fact, there will still be some interviews and a qualification process for all the job candidates.\nThe competition will take place across three qualifying rounds beginning in April, with the final Grand Prix race scheduled for November.  \n"

    "body": "\nGoogle is the latest investor to back Redwood Materials as the battery recycling and cathode production startup scales a new energy storage venture to power AI data centers and other industrial sites. \nRedwood Materials, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, last October raised $350 million in a Series E round led by venture firm Eclipse. The round included a new strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures.\nMore investors, including newcomer Google, have piled in since, pushing the Series E to $425 million, the company said. Existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs have also returned with fresh investments.\nThe company’s valuation was not publicly disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch its post-money valuation was north of $6 billion, more than a billion higher than its previous valuation. This latest investment pushes Redwood’s total capital raised to $4.9 billion.\nThe attraction for Google, Nvidia, and others in this latest round appears to be energy storage — and its ability to power data centers — a newer business venture within Redwood.  \nRedwood Materials was founded in 2017 to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. Redwood processes that scrap and extracts materials that are traditionally mined, like nickel and lithium. The newly processed materials are then sold to customers such as Panasonic, which use them to make batteries.\nRedwood has continued to expand its business beyond recycling. The Carson City, Nevada-based company added cathode production several years ago, and last summer, launched an energy-storage business that repurposes EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled and turns them into micro-grids that can supply power to AI data centers and large-scale industrial sites.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat new business, called Redwood Energy, got its start as the demand for data centers skyrocketed.\n“As electricity demand surges — driven by AI, data centers, manufacturing and electrification — energy storage is no longer optional; it is essential infrastructure,” the company said in a blog post announcing the new funding.\nAnd Redwood seems to have the means to power at least some of those data centers. The company said in June it recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America, many of which can have a second life as energy storage.\nRedwood said last year it had more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth in its inventory and expected to receive another 4 gigawatt-hours over the coming months. The company expects to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage by 2028.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:TechCrunch\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:07 PM PST · January 27, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nGoogle is bringing AI-powered photo editing to more users around the world, making it easier to fix your photos with simple text commands instead of complicated editing tools.\nThe company announced Tuesday that it’s expanding natural language-based editing in Google Photos to additional countries, including Australia, India, and Japan. The feature, which Google first launched for Pixel 10 users in the U.S. last August, lets people describe the changes they want to make to their photos rather than manually adjusting sliders or learning complex editing software.\nUsers in these newly supported countries will now see a “Help me Edit” box when they tap the edit option on a photo. From there, they can either select from suggested prompts or type their own requests in plain language. For example, you could ask the app to “remove the motorcycle in the background,” “reduce the background blur,” or use a more general command like “restore this old photo.”\nThe AI can handle surprisingly specific requests too. You can ask it to edit a friend’s pose, remove their glasses, or even have them open their eyes in a photo where they blinked. The feature uses Google’s Nano Banana image model to transform photos, and all the processing happens directly within the app without requiring an internet connection for the actual editing.\n\nLoading the player…\nThe feature will work on any Android device with at least 4GB of RAM running Android 8.0 or higher, meaning it’s not limited to Google’s own Pixel phones. Along with this geographic expansion, Google is also adding language support beyond English, including Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, and Gujarati, making the tool accessible to millions more users in their native languages.\nGoogle is also rolling out C2PA Content Credentials support in Google Photos for these countries. This metadata  will indicate when an image was created or edited using AI. As AI-generated and AI-edited images become more common, social media platforms have been grappling with how to label AI content, and credentials like C2PA help users understand what they’re looking at.The expansion is the latest in Google’s aggressive push to integrate AI throughout Google Photos. Last November, the company expanded AI-powered search capabilities to over 100 countries with support for more than 17 languages. It also introduced AI templates that can convert photos into different artistic styles. Just last week, Google rolled out a “Meme me” feature that lets users combine reference templates with their own images to create memes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n​ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, recently established a separate American entity to run the app’s U.S. operations. This restructuring aims to separate U.S. TikTok from its Chinese parent, addressing concerns about data privacy and foreign control.\nThe move came after years of pressure from lawmakers, who feared the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. In 2024, Congress enacted a law, mandating that TikTok’s U.S. operations be separated from ByteDance.\n​Under the new structure, about 80% of the U.S. TikTok entity is owned by non-Chinese investors, with ByteDance keeping only a 19.9% share. The newly formed entity, “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” licenses TikTok’s recommendation algorithm from ByteDance and independently manages content moderation, and oversees data protection, algorithm security, and software controls.\nThe managing investor group consists of Oracle, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX. Each holds a 15% stake, totaling 45% of the U.S. business. Here’s what you should know about them.\nOracle\nOracle is a leading cloud computing and database firm that collaborates with top companies, such as OpenAI. Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok and already provides cloud infrastructure for the app, managing its U.S. user data. \nUnder the new deal, Oracle serves as the security partner, auditing TikTok’s compliance with U.S. security requirements, managing data storage, and overseeing updates to the content recommendation algorithm. \nIt’s important to note that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, now the company’s executive chairman and chief technology officer, is a prominent billionaire with known connections to President Trump. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMGX\nMGX is an AI-focused investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates, which invests in semiconductors and data centers. The firm was created by Mubadala (Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund) and G42, an Emirati AI company. \nMGX’s stake in U.S. TikTok could give the firm influence over key decisions shaping TikTok’s AI direction. The firm already backs Elon Musk’s xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI, and contributed to a $100 billion AI data center initiative announced by President Trump, in which Oracle is participating as well. \nIt’s also worth pointing out that MGX has partnerships with Microsoft and BlackRock.\nSilver Lake\nSilver Lake, a leading U.S. private equity firm, has long invested heavily in technology companies, including Airbnb, Twitter, Dell Technologies, Tesla, and Waymo. Its role in U.S. TikTok is primarily financial and strategic, offering capital and expertise to help shape the platform’s direction.\nNotably, Silver Lake has collaborated with MGX in the past, including during the acquisition of a majority stake in the software and chip company Altera last year. Additionally, Silver Lake has invested in G42 since 2021.\nOther investors\n\nDell Family Office: Michael Dell’s investment firm.\nVastmere Strategic Investments: A firm affiliated with Susquehanna International Group (SIG), which is owned by billionaire Jeff Yass.\nAlpha Wave Partners: A global investment firm involved with notable companies, including SpaceX and Klarna.\nVirgo LI: The investment arm associated with Israeli tech investor Yuri Milner, who was an early backer of Facebook and Twitter.\nNJJ Capital: The family office of Xavier Niel, a French billionaire businessman who founded telecommunications company Iliad.\nRevolution: The venture capital firm founded by AOL co-founder Steve Case.\nMerritt Way: Managed by partners of Dragoneer Investment Group, a San Francisco-based investment firm.\nVia Nova: An affiliate of General Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nBy Rotation, one of the U.K.’s most popular peer-to-peer fashion rental platforms, announced on Wednesday a partnership with the ride-sharing app Uber. \nFrom now until May 31, By Rotation users in the U.K. can rent outfits from others in their neighborhood and have them delivered via Uber within 60 minutes at a 10% discount. Though the discount applies to all users, the service is geared toward those renting ski gear. By Rotation said that 30% of the ski renters on its platform look for same-day pickup, and this partnership seeks to alleviate the annoyance of renting bulky, expensive ski gear and having to lug it around.\nThe partnership is fun and timely. Previously, By Rotation teamed up with Airbnb to provide rental wedding outfits for guests attending destination weddings. It was another creative collaboration that sought to meet consumers where they are. Right now, ski clothing has become quite the fashion symbol online as the sport remains a popular pastime across Europe. \nEshita Kabra-Davies, the founder and CEO of By Rotation, told TechCrunch that the partnership came from “listening to our community,” and that the company realized that, though consumers love how sustainable renting clothing can be, they also wanted the “speed and convenience of e-commerce.” \n“With one in four rentals made within 48 hours of an event, logistics was the final friction point,” she said. She called this the “emergency economy,” or the moment of “satorical panic” when someone realized they needed an outfit immediately. Usually, when this moment comes, a person has to run out to make a “panic purchase” for a new outfit. “We have wanted to change this behavior by removing the one thing standing in the way — logistics,” Kabra-Davies said. \nTeaming up with Uber makes consumers move from “fast fashion” to “slow fashion,” she said. Fashion remains one of the most polluting industries in the world. As a result, the sharing economy — or the circular economy —has become popular among young people looking for more sustainable, and often more affordable, ways to buy clothing.\nWhen users renting in their neighborhoods go to the app’s checkout page, they will be prompted via a pop-up banner to use Uber Courier, where the By Rotation discount will automatically be applied. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It gives our community the luxury of choice; they can now secure a high-quality, high-value piece over a disposable garment, simply because it can reach their door just as quickly,” Kabra-Davies continued.\nKabra-Davies launched By Rotation in 2019 and has scaled it into one of the world’s largest peer-to-peer rental platforms. The platform has more than 1 million users (like song writer Ellie Goulding), she said, and it manages luxury inventory worth more than $100 million. With this, the company has expanded beyond being a fashion rental platform, Kabra-Davies said. \n“A powerful example is one of our top lenders who actually used her wardrobe earnings to fund her IVF journey, which has led to successful surrogacy,” she said. Next, the brand hopes to keep building the “world’s largest shared wardrobe.” It’s already launched in New York and has its eyes on the UAE. “Our ambition, like Uber’s, is global,”  Kabra-Davies said. “We want to make the ‘rotating wardrobe’ the default mode of consumption everywhere.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe latest wave of AI excitement has brought us an unexpected mascot: a lobster. Clawdbot, a personal AI assistant, went viral within weeks of its launch and will keep its crustacean theme despite having had to change its name to Moltbot after a legal challenge from Anthropic. But before you jump on the bandwagon, here’s what you need to know.\nAccording to its tagline, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) is the “AI that actually does things” — whether it’s managing your calendar, sending messages through your favorite apps, or checking you in for flights. This promise has drawn thousands of users willing to tackle the technical setup required, even though it started as a scrappy personal project built by one developer for his own use.\nThat man is Peter Steinberger, an Austrian developer and founder who is known online as @steipete and actively blogs about his work. After stepping away from his previous project, PSPDFkit, Steinberger felt empty and barely touched his computer for three years, he explained on his blog. But he eventually found his spark again — which led to Moltbot.\nWhile Moltbot is now much more than a solo project, the publicly available version still derives from Clawd, “Peter’s crusted assistant,” now called Molty, a tool he built to help him “manage his digital life” and “explore what human-AI collaboration can be.” \nFor Steinberger, this meant diving deeper into the momentum around AI that had reignited his builder spark. A self-confessed “Claudoholic”, he initially named his project after Anthropic’s AI flagship product, Claude. He revealed on X that Anthropic subsequently forced him to change the branding for copyright reasons. TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic for comment. But the project’s “lobster soul” remains unchanged.\nTo its early adopters, Moltbot represents the vanguard of how helpful AI assistants could be. Those who were already excited at the prospect of using AI to quickly generate websites and apps are even more keen to have their personal AI assistant perform tasks for them. And just like Steinberger, they’re eager to tinker with it.\nThis explains how Moltbot amassed more than 44,200 stars on GitHub so quickly. So much viral attention has been paid Moltbot that it has even moved markets. Cloudflare’s stock surged 14% in premarket trading on Tuesday as social media buzz around the AI agent resparked investor enthusiasm for Cloudflare’s infrastructure, which developers use to run Moltbot locally on their devices.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStill, it’s a long way from breaking out of early adopter territory, and maybe that’s for the best. Installing Moltbot requires being tech savvy, and that also includes awareness of the inherent security risks that come with it.\nOn one hand, Moltbot is built with safety in mind: It is open source, meaning anyone can inspect its code for vulnerabilities, and it runs on your computer or server, not in the cloud. But on the other hand, its very premise is inherently risky. As entrepreneur and investor Rahul Sood pointed out on X, “‘actually doing things’ means ‘can execute arbitrary commands on your computer.’”\nWhat keeps Sood up at night is “prompt injection through content” — where a malicious person could send you a WhatsApp message that could lead Moltbot to take unintended actions on your computer without your intervention or knowledge. \nThat risk can be mitigated partly by careful setup. Since Moltbot supports various AI models, users may want to make setup choices based on their resistance to these kinds of attacks. But the only way to fully prevent it is to run Moltbot in a silo. \nThis may be obvious to experienced developers tinkering with a weeks-old project, but some of them have become more vocal in warning users attracted by the hype: things could turn ugly fast if they approach it as carelessly as ChatGPT. \nSteinberger himself was served with a reminder that malicious actors exist when he “messed up” the renaming of his project. He complained on X that “crypto scammers” snatched his GitHub username and created fake cryptocurrency projects in his name, and he warned followers that “any project that lists [him] as coin owner is a SCAM.” He then posted that the GitHub issue had been fixed but cautioned that the legitimate X account is @moltbot, “not any of the 20 scam variations of it.”\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean you should stay away from Moltbot at this stage if you are curious to test it. But if you have never heard of a VPS — a virtual private server, which is essentially a remote computer you rent to run software — you may want to wait your turn. (That’s where you may want to run Moltbot for now. “Not the laptop with your SSH keys, API credentials, and password manager,” Sood cautioned.)\nRight now, running Moltbot safely means running it on a separate computer with throwaway accounts, which defeats the purpose of having a useful AI assistant. And fixing that security-versus-utility trade-off may require solutions that are beyond Steinberger’s control.\nStill, by building a tool to solve his own problem, Steinberger showed the developer community what AI agents could actually accomplish and how autonomous AI might finally become genuinely useful rather than just impressive.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

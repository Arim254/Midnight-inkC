Other prompts featuring a colorful background offered different ideas of things to ask Gemini, or suggested use cases.

On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/vibe-coding-helps-supabase-nab-200m-at-2b-valuation-just-seven-months-after-its-last-raise/\">its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation,</a> led by Accel.</p>\n<p>And that Series D was just seven months after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/supabase-a-postgres-centric-developer-platform-raises-80m-series-c/\">raising an $80 million Series C</a> led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.</p>\n<p>So that’s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.</p>\n<p>Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.</p>\n<p>Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts — like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/lovables-ceo-isnt-too-worried-about-the-vibe-coding-competition/\">fast-growing Lovable</a> and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/iconiqs-will-griffith-explains-how-his-firm-celebrated-figmas-ipo-and-why-investors-sold-shares/\">Figma</a> and other uber popular AI coding tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/after-nine-years-of-grinding-replit-finally-found-its-market-can-it-keep-it/\">Replit,</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">Cursor</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/anthropic-bundles-claude-code-into-enterprise-plans/\">Claude Code</a>, it says.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

On <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its first day</a>, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on Apple’s U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>. On Friday, October 3, it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/openai-sora-apple-app-store.html\" target=\"_blank\">became</a> the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store.</p>\n<p>That puts it ahead of Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30 and October 1.</p>\n<p>The day-one figure also puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.</p>\n<p>Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even <em>more</em> installs if it were open to all users.</p>\n<p>Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-staff-grapples-with-the-companys-social-media-push/\">chagrin of some at OpenAI</a>, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking</a>, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)</p>\n<p>To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/openai-launches-an-official-chatgpt-app-for-ios/\">limited itself to U.S. users</a> at the time, while Grok <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/xai-is-testing-a-standalone-ios-app-for-its-grok-chatbot/\">limited its iOS-only</a> release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/anthropics-claude-sees-tepid-reception-on-ios-compared-with-chatgpts-debut/\">its Claude app to iOS last year</a>. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.</p>\n<p>It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.</p>\n<p>Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. </p>\n<p><em>This post was originally published on October 2, 2025, 11:24 AM PT.

The Justice Department did not respond to questions regarding details of the apps ordered to be taken down, and how many were on its list.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that ICEBlock does not collect or store any user data, which TechCrunch has confirmed by analyzing the app’s network traffic as part of a test.</p>\n<p>The takedown comes in the wake of mounting tensions between the Trump administration and those who oppose the government’s hardline immigration agenda, especially after a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/second-detainee-dies-week-after-dallas-ice-shooting-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">shooting</a> at an ICE detention center in Dallas last week resulted in two detainees being killed and one in the hospital.

Officials have repeatedly threatened legal action against those using ICEBlock, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in July said officials were trying to see if <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/01/kristi-noem-cnn-prosecution-00435445\" target=\"_blank\">CNN could be prosecuted for reporting about the app</a>.</p>\n<p>“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Bondi in July also <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/attorney-general-pam-bondi-warns-iceblock-app-developer-watch-out-says-doj-looking-him\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> ICEBlock’s developer, Joshua Aaron, that the Justice Department was “looking at him.”</p>\n<p>Apple and the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/snapchat-caps-free-memory-storage-launches-paid-storage-plans/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> last week that it’s capping free Memories storage at 5GB. </p>\n<p>If your Memories exceed the limit, you will need to either export them or sign up for one of Snapchat’s new Memories Storage plans in order to preserve them. </p>\n<p>The company told TechCrunch in an email that the introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription.</p>\n<p>If you’re over the limit but don’t sign up for a plan, your oldest Snaps will be saved, while the most recent ones will be deleted to stay within the storage limit.</p>\n<p>Although the company has given users 12 months of temporary storage for Memories that exceed the 5GB limit, some users are proactively choosing to export their Memories instead of paying up. </p>\n<p>We’ll walk you through the two options you have for preserving your Snapchat Memories. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-export-your-snapchat-memories-to-your-device-s-camera-roll\">Export your Snapchat Memories to your device’s camera roll</h2>\n<p>One way to save your Snapchat Memories is by downloading them to your camera roll.

(Uncheck the options below unless you also want to save additional information, such as your chat history, user data, and more. Just keep in mind, it might be harder to find your Memories later in the .zip file.)</li>\n<li>Tap “Next.”</li>\n<li>Select the “All Time” option when prompted to choose a date range for the export.</li>\n<li>Confirm your email address.</li>\n<li>Tap “Submit.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The time it takes to receive your data may vary depending on how much you have stored. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

YC is estimated to accept <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/investors\" target=\"_blank\">around 1% of applicants</a>, and at a certain point, some luck is required to really capture a partner’s eye — maybe your pitch is the first that a partner watched after a very rejuvenating coffee break, or maybe your company is the last video on the list and everyone’s tired.</p>\n<p>“Many rejected founders went on to build incredibly successful companies afterwards,” reads a note at the start of the game. “Rejection means nothing — even the most successful founders got rejected multiple times.”</p>\n<p>YC Arena has other games that ask you to match a company name to its logo, or guess what year a company did YC based on its description (spoiler alert: There’s a lot more AI in recent years). But the YC Partner Simulator game is the most interesting since it makes us confront our own decision-making processes.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>As a tech journalist, I thought I would be pretty good at the YC Partner Simulator. I may not be an investor, but I know what it’s like to sift through an inbox full of startup pitches and choose which ones pique my curiosity — I’ve walked the floor of TechCrunch Disrupt’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield 200 Expo</a> with the task of identifying companies to interview and write about. But this game is hard. After all, we’re working within different parameters, since the newsworthiness of a company is not directly tied to its potential to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>(For example: As I write this, there’s an AI pet sitting in my lap that I’m planning to review. Would I put money on the bet that Casio will turn a profit off the investment it takes to create <a href=\"https://www.casio.com/us/moflin/\" target=\"_blank\">a glorified Furby that retails for $430</a>? No. Do I expect that an article about my life with an AI pet will be interesting to readers? Yes.)</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>If anything, the game shows just how subjective these processes can be. But after I read YC co-founder Paul Graham’s <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply\" target=\"_blank\">application guide</a>, my guesses started to get more accurate.</p>\n<p>“You have to be exceptionally clear and concise,” Graham wrote. “Whatever you have to say, give it to us right in the first sentence, in the simplest possible terms.” (For the record, this advice also applies to emailing journalists.) </p>\n<p>I played the game again, but this time, I paid less attention to what the company was pitching and more attention to how quickly they could convey what their company does. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend this strategy for evaluating a startup in real life (hot take: you should care what a company does!), but for the purposes of the game, I ended up choosing a company’s fate more accurately.</p>\n<p>This probably isn’t a coincidence. When OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman was president of YC, he remarked in an interview that the incubator spent just <a href=\"https://x.com/StartupArchive_/status/1929568737876717917\" target=\"_blank\">10 minutes</a> reviewing each company’s application to make a decision.</p>\n<p>“It turns out that in 10 minutes, if the only question you’re trying to answer is, ‘Does this person have the potential to be the next Mark Zuckerberg?’ … You can answer that question in 10 minutes,” Altman said in 2016. “Not with 100 percent accuracy, obviously, but good enough that our business model works.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

So when early <a href=\"https://www.upstartsmedia.com/p/happyrobot-spanish-founders-ai-logistics\" target=\"_blank\">HappyRobot</a> engineer Ari Polakof decided to strike out and start his own company, he didn’t exactly expect to wind up tapping on his laptop in a service bay alongside mechanics.</p>\n<p>“Very noisy, impossible to concentrate,” he laughed.</p>\n<p>But that’s part of the story of how Polakof’s new AI-for-car-dealerships startup <a href=\"https://www.useflai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flai</a> got off the ground last year.</p>\n<p>Founded by Polakof and his brother Alen (also from HappyRobot) at Y Combinator, along with former Netflix data scientist Juan Alzugaray, Flai is one of a number of startups trying to use artificial intelligence to improve the experience of buying, selling, or servicing a car at a dealership.</p>\n<p>The co-founders have built software from the ground up that’s specially tailored for the car dealership environment. And it’s “omni-channel,” as Polakof said in an interview, meaning it can handle phone calls (using voice agents) as well as emails and texts (using large language models).</p>\n<p>Now, Flai has closed a $4.5 million seed round to try and scale up what they’ve built. The round was led by Liz Wessel at First Round Capital, and included funding from YC, RedBlue Capital, Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures, and Innovation Endeavors.  </p>\n<p>Flai is not the only one doing this kind of work. Earlier this year, another YC-backed startup called Toma announced it had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/tomas-ai-voice-agents-have-taken-off-at-car-dealerships-and-attracted-funding-from-a16z/\">raised $17 million</a> from the likes of a16z and Yossi Levi, the car industry influencer known as Car Dealership Guy. A swarm of others are trying to build similar products, while legacy interactive voice response companies — the ones who make the phone tree software we’ve all become overly familiar with — look to keep pace.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Polakof, who is CEO, said Flai’s offering is different in that it’s not using off-the-shelf voice tech. The startup has built essentially everything from scratch, which in particular has made its voice agents impressive enough that Polakof claims it’s already convinced a few dealers to switch from other companies.</p>\n<p>Besides, he said, there is a lot of room for competition in the market. There are thousands of car dealerships and service centers across the United States, and the majority of them have the same problem: they can lose potential customers if their phone lines are tied up. </p>\n<p>After getting off the ground last year, the Flai team realized the best way to train their AI, and to start racking up customers, was to start showing up at those dealerships.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they tried cold calling, or emailing, or LinkedIn messaging, or even showing up at conferences to network. But the bulk of the early work Flai got done was from going directly to the brick-and-mortar locations — around 400 in those early days, by Polakof’s count.</p>\n<p>Once Flai struck up these initial relationships, Polakof said they essentially embedded with each dealer. That’s how he found himself in a service bay last year — though, he said, more often it just meant setting up in an empty office.</p>\n<p>Polakof said the Flai team spent “every day, all day on the road” during that initial period. “It’s almost very tiring, painful, but I think it’s the only way, and I can’t imagine a bigger company doing it,” he said.</p>\n<p>As the startup transitions out of that learning period and into one more focused on growing and making customers happy, Polakof said the small team is still pushing long hours — like so many of their <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-china-996-work-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">peers in Silicon Valley</a>.</p>\n<p>The seed funding will help Flai grow, but Polakof said he doesn’t expect the team to explode. </p>\n<p>“We want to work as smart as we can,” he said. “We don’t want to have 100, 200 people working on this right now.” Instead, he said the three-man team keeps each other “accountable” by focusing on tasks that are “100% required, otherwise it’s not worth it.”</p>\n<p>In that sense, Polakof isn’t so far from those earliest days working in a service bay or dealership back office — just with less noise and fewer mechanics.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI has acquired Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. In keeping with a recent trend in the AI industry, only the CEO is making the jump.  </p>\n<p>Chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1974190926177460670?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the acquisition on Friday, and a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch he is the only one of Roi’s four-person staff to join OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15. </p>\n<p>The Roi deal marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-hires-team-behind-gv-backed-ai-eval-platform-context-ai/\">Context.ai</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/openai-hires-team-behind-ai-recommendation-startup-crossing-minds/\">Crossing Minds</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/openai-hires-the-team-behind-xcode-coding-assistant-alex-codes/\">Alex</a>.</p>\n<p>While it’s not clear whether any of Roi’s technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI’s bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly.   </p>\n<p>New York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user’s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades.  </p>\n<p>“We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1974190926177460670?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a>. “Along the way we realized personalization isn’t just the future of finance. It’s the future of software.” </p>\n<p>Beyond tracking trades, Roi gave users access to a financially savvy AI companion that responded in ways that made sense for them. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>In one telling example that <a href=\"https://x.com/investwithroi/status/1886506081087807532\" target=\"_blank\">Roi posted on X</a>, the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like I’m a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you want I don’t mind.” In response to a query about the status of the user’s portfolio, Roi replied: “Suje, you got cooked lil bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.” </p>\n<p>The exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder — that software shouldn’t just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep you engaged.  </p>\n<p>As the Roi team wrote in a blog post: “The products we use every day won’t remain static, predetermined experiences. They’ll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.” </p>\n<p>That vision dovetails with OpenAI’s existing consumer efforts, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\" target=\"_blank\">Pulse</a>, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">Sora</a> app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Checkout</a>, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT.  </p>\n<p>The deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team,  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/instacart-ceo-fidji-simo-is-joining-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo</a>. It’s a further signal that OpenAI isn’t just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Roi’s talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive.  </p>\n<p>Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue. By his <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1628097851770417152\" target=\"_blank\">account</a>, a simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in additional cash.  </p>\n<p>Being able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">billions on data centers and infrastructure</a> to power its models.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI is gearing up to host its third annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.</p>\n<p>From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/\">building an AI device</a>, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">social media app</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/\">an AI-powered browser</a> to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.</p>\n<p>At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.</p>\n<p>OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/openai-launches-gpt-4-turbo-and-launches-fine-tuning-program-for-gpt-4/\">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/app-store-for-ai-build-your-own-gpt-and-sell-it-on-openais-gpt-store/\">the GPT Store</a>. Altman was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/sam-altman-is-out-as-openais-ceo/\">ousted as CEO</a> days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/openais-devday-brings-realtime-api-and-other-treats-for-ai-app-developers/\">API for AI voice applications</a>, but not much else.</p>\n<p>Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched last year.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/OpenAI\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s YouTube page</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.</p>\n<p>For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.</p>\n<p>There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”</p>\n<p>Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.</p>\n<p>At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.</p>\n<p>Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.</p>\n<p><em>Update 10/3/25: OpenAI updated the attendee list for DevDay 2025.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>This week, the Department of Energy canceled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/department-of-energy-cancels-7-5b-of-clean-energy-projects-in-mostly-blue-states/\">nearly $8 billion</a> worth of awards — a move touted by the Trump administration as an effort to protect fossil fuels at the expense of renewables. But documents obtained by TechCrunch show that the reality is more complex than that simple message.</p>\n<p>The agency has not released a list of the canceled awards, but TechCrunch has obtained a copy and has analyzed the 321 contracts that the DOE is seeking to undo.</p>\n<p>Not all projects focused on renewable energy, though. </p>\n<p>Two listed in the document, one for <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEFE0032657_089\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million</a> to Colorado State University and another for <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEFE0032658_089\" target=\"_blank\">$210 million</a> to the Gas Technology Institute, would have helped oil and gas producers large and small reduce methane emissions from their wells.</p>\n<p>The Gas Technology Institute is a research and development organization that mostly caters to the natural gas industry. The group had a dozen awards canceled, according to the document, totaling $417 million.</p>\n<p>Carbon capture and removal also took a hit, with 10 of the 21 projects canceled totaling around $200 million. Many are in Harris-voting states, though that rubric doesn’t explain the entire picture. </p>\n<p>“Three categories are popping up,” Erin Burns, executive director at <a href=\"https://carbon180.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon180</a>, told TechCrunch. “Where are they located? Who are the partners in it? Were these projects going to move forward?”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It’s true that states which voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election were hit hardest by the move. California lost the most, with at least $2.2 billion worth of contracts canceled. Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Oregon each have around half a billion dollars’ worth of awards that were killed, with New York State losing at least $309 million.</p>\n<p>Those that voted for Trump tended to have contracts canceled worth single-digit millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>One of the largest awards canceled was granted to the state of Minnesota for <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEGD0000931_089\" target=\"_blank\">$467 million</a>. Awarded as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, the money was intended to revamp electrical grid interconnections throughout seven states in the Midwest. When complete, it would have unlocked around 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, mostly solar and wind. For context, the world’s data center fleet draws <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030\" target=\"_blank\">58 gigawatts</a>, according to Goldman Sachs.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEGD0000962_089\" target=\"_blank\">worth $630 million</a> would have likewise revamped California’s electrical grid, testing advanced conductors and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/linevision-and-ge-team-up-to-fortify-the-electrical-grid-to-handle-more-renewables/\">dynamic line rating devices</a> to increase transmission capacity. The project effectively would have been a showcase for grid modernization that could be applied throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Yet another grid modernization project would have installed a transmission line to the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs in Oregon. The tribes have <a href=\"https://tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/energy/14885-oregon-tribe-s-857m-power-line-upgrade-could-unlock-renewable-energy-future\" target=\"_blank\">roughly half a dozen</a> renewable projects waiting on a better grid connection, which the now-canceled <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEGD0000934_089\" target=\"_blank\">$250 million</a> award would have enabled. The project would also have strung fiber-optic lines along the transmission line’s path, bringing high-speed data to a rural part of the state.</p>\n<p>“The recipients who have survived in blue states are perhaps more aligned with the administration and participating in industries that are more of a priority for this administration,” said Courtni Holness, managing policy advisor at Carbon180.</p>\n<p>Some of the smaller awards might have been nixed anyway. “That’s just how the U.S. approaches energy innovation in general,” Burns said. “Take a lot of shots on goal because you’re not sure what’s going to move forward regionally, technologically, economically. And so you take a bunch of shots on goal at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>Still others appear to be pulling up stakes to move where government support and policies are going to be more predictable, like Canada. “You’re going to see more of that, and it’s having impact on private sector investments,” Burns said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a bigger question,” Holness added, “about the stability of our Department of Energy and their ability to be a partner to U.S. businesses and have some form of predictability.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

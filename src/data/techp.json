    "body": "\nFor the last several months, nuclear startups have been raising large sums of money — well over $1 billion so far.\nData centers and their thirst for electricity have been one driving force. But recent changes to federal nuclear safety policies could be another accelerant that helps clear the way for speedy reactor development and at a potential cost to human and environmental health.\nThe Trump administration has quietly changed how the Department of Energy oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants built on its properties, according to a report from NPR. About a third of the rulebook has been axed, and several sections have been heavily revised. Previous requirements, including those aimed at limiting groundwater and environmental contamination, are now suggestions, and workers can be exposed to higher doses of radiation. Plant security protocols are now largely up to the company.\nThe new rules were developed without public comment or notice, according to NPR. They only apply to reactors built on DOE property; those built elsewhere are still subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Several startups are developing demonstration reactors on DOE property in the hopes of hitting a Trump administration deadline of July 4, 2026.\n"

    "body": "\nTesla’s profit fell 46% in 2025 compared to the prior year, as CEO Elon Musk assumed a role in the Trump administration and federal electric vehicle subsidies were killed off by Congress, causing sales to plummet.\nThe electric vehicle company reported Wednesday that it recorded just $3.8 billion in profit across 2025, its lowest tally in years. Total revenue from car sales fell 11% year-over-year, too. Tesla already revealed that it shipped 1.63 million cars globally across 2025. That marks the second year in a row that its sales have declined, after Musk spent years promising average annual growth of 50%.\nInvestors largely expected the decline in sales in Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year results for 2025, and the company beat Wall Street’s estimates for earnings and revenue, sending shares up in after-market trading Wednesday. It’s been largely buoyed by strength in its other industries and investments, including energy capabilities and AI, as Tesla has continued to lure investors’ attention away from its stalled-out automotive business.\nThe company wrote in its shareholder letter: “2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company.” \nThe company revealed in the letter that it recently invested $2 billion in Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, part of the latter’s recent Series E funding round.\nRevenue from Tesla’s solar and energy storage businesses also grew 25% compared to 2024, and services revenue (which includes payments for Full Self-Driving software, insurance, parts, and Supercharging) grew 18%. The company was even able to grow its gross margin compared to prior quarters.\nLong-awaited projects like the Tesla Semi (first revealed in 2017) and the Cybercab (which debuted in 2024, but has been teased for years) are supposed to enter production in the first half of this year, according to Tesla.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has a lot of other projects on its plate, which were detailed in the shareholder letter.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft and OpenAI may have a notoriously rocky relationship but as OpenAI experiences never-before-seen revenue growth, Microsoft, one of its major investors, is benefiting greatly.\nWhen the software giant reported its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday, it dropped this rather large nugget in: Its net income increased by $7.6 billion from its investment in OpenAI.\nOpenAI reportedly has a 20% revenue share agreement with Microsoft (though neither company has ever publicly confirmed that). The software giant has invested more than $13 billion in the AI lab, which is currently looking to raise additional funding at a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nIn September, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated some of the terms of their deal when OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation.\nAs part of that deal, OpenAI agreed to buy another $250 billion of Azure services. That commitment shows on Microsoft’s books as “commercial remaining performance obligations,” or contracts that Microsoft has that have not yet been paid out. Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft said that 45% of that is from OpenAI.\nAnthropic got a shout-out in the quarterly earnings, too, in helping boost Microsoft’s anticipated future revenue in the form of commercial bookings, which grew 230%. In November, Microsoft announced that it was investing $5 billion into Anthropic and the AI lab had signed up for $30 billion of Azure compute capacity, with intent to buy more later.\nBut Microsoft is also spending big to feed the AI machine. It spent $37.5 billion in the quarter on capital expenditures, two-thirds of which were for what Microsoft called “short-lived” assets: primarily the GPUs and CPUs for its cloud Azure to serve AI.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company reported $81.3 billion in revenue (Wall Street analysts expected $80.27 billion, so that’s a solid beat), up 17% over the year-ago period. Its Microsoft Cloud revenue hit $50 billion this quarter for the first time. All of Microsoft’s business units increased by double-digit percentages over the year-ago quarter with the exception of Windows devices, which gained 1% (essentially flat), and Xbox content and services, which were down 5%.\n"

    "body": "\nEarlier this month, Meta laid off 10% of the staff for Reality Labs, its virtual reality unit, reportedly cutting as many as 1,000 employees. Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.\nOn Wednesday, Meta’s earnings report showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.\nThose losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.\nDuring the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company’s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.\n“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,” Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. “I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,” Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would “likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.” \nWhen Meta announced a pivot toward the “metaverse” in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company faced harsh criticism — even being referred to as an “international laughingstock.” Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism hasn’t exactly subsided. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it’s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.\nLast week, CNBC reported that, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios — another sign that the company’s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be retiring its standalone Workrooms app — which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nCreator platform Patreon is taking issue with Apple’s new mandate that forces all creators to move to a subscription billing model, which now has a new transition deadline of November 1, 2026. \nWhile the coming changes will only impact the 4% of creators who are still using Patreon’s legacy billing models, the company’s announcement stressed that Apple’s lack of consistency around its changing terms has made it hard for creators to build healthy, long-term businesses.\nWhat Patreon is referring to is the mandate Apple announced in 2024 around subscription billing changes. It said that Patreon must move all its creators to subscription billing using Apple’s in-app purchase system by November 2025 or else Patreon would risk removal from the App Store. Apple made this decision because Patreon was managing the billing for some percentage of creators’ subscriptions, and the tech giant saw that as skirting its App Store commission structure.\nTo Apple’s credit, Patreon was given plenty of time to migrate its customers to Apple’s in-app purchases. \nThe company said it would switch creators to subscription billing in November 2024, and creators could choose whether to increase their subscription prices to cover Apple’s fees. In addition, creators could opt to delay changes until November 2025 if they needed more time. However, they wouldn’t be able to offer subscriptions in the app until they adopted Apple’s in-app purchases.\nLast May, Patreon took advantage of newly loosened App Store guidelines resulting from the U.S. court ruling in Epic v. Apple to offer creators the ability to process web payments from links in Patreon’s app. At the time, Patreon told creators that the earlier November 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. This gave creators even more time to decide what to do about their subscription businesses.\nThe company says now that its decision to pause the transition for its creators may have added to the confusion given that Apple is now reimposing a transition deadline of November 2026.\nWhile Patreon is complying with Apple’s decision, it’s clearly bristling at the idea that the tech giant should have a say in how creators run their businesses.\n“We strongly disagree with this decision,” its blog post states. \n“Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months. Over the years, we have proposed multiple tools and features to Apple that we could’ve built to allow creators using legacy billing to transition on their own timelines, with more support added in. Unfortunately, Apple has continually declined them,” it says.\nCreators can read more about the transition plan on Patreon’s website. It has also built several tools to support these changes, including a benefit eligibility tool to see who has paid or is scheduled to pay, tier repricing tools, and gifting and discount tools to offer payment flexibility. An option for annual-only memberships will be introduced before November 2026 as well.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThree weeks ago, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, revealed it raised $20 billion in a Series E funding round. Now we know Tesla is among its investors.\nTesla disclosed in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns Musk’s social media company X. Other previously disclosed investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”\nThis is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a nonbinding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per Bloomberg’s reporting at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.\nTesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument, in its shareholder letter and during its earnings call, in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.\n“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”\nTesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk confirmed last year, and the company has included the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles. Bloomberg also reported that xAI told investors it plans to build AI for humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.\nMusk noted that there are many tasks Tesla can do internally. “But if there are things xAI can help accelerate our progress, then why should we not do that?” he asked. “And that is the reason why we’ve gone ahead with such an investment. Because this is part of the strategic initiative.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit fell 46% last year.\n“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.\nThe investment is expected to close in the first quarter. \nMusk and Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja signaled during the company’s earnings call it expect other capital expenditures that support its mission. \n“This year for Tesla is the first major steps as we increase vehicle autonomy and begin to produce Optimus robots at scale — we’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on the call. “So this is going to be a very big capex here; that is deliberate, because we’re making big investments for an epic future.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nMark Zuckerberg says Meta users will start to see new AI models and products from the company in a matter of months.\n“In 2025, we rebuilt the foundations of our AI program,” Zuckerberg said on an investor call Wednesday, referring to the company’s recently restructured AI lab. “Over the coming months, we’re going to start shipping our new models and products… and I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the new year.”\nBut while Zuckerberg didn’t give specific timelines or products, he highlighted AI-driven commerce as a particular area of focus for Meta.\n“This also has implications for commerce,” Zuckerberg continued. “New agentic shopping tools will allow people to find just the right set of products from the businesses in our catalog.”\nThat proposal echoes broader interest in AI-powered shopping assistants across the industry. Both Google and OpenAI have built platforms for agent-enabled transactions, with companies like Stripe and Uber signed on as partners.\nBut while other AI labs have already built significant technical infrastructure, Meta believes its access to personal data will prove uniquely valuable.\n“We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn December, Meta acquired the general-purpose agent developer Manus, which provides similar technology. At the time, Meta said it would “continue to operate and sell the Manus service, as well as integrate it into our products.”\nThe investor call was timed to the release of Meta’s most recent quarterly earnings, which also disclosed a significant increase in new infrastructure spending. The company now anticipates that it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on overall capital expenditures over the course of 2026, up from $72 billion in 2025.\nIn its official filing, Meta attributed the jump to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.”\nWhile significant, the figure still falls short of the projected $600 billion that Zuckerberg reportedly projected for Meta’s infrastructure spending through 2028.\nMeta has previously drawn criticism from investors for failing to clearly state how its massive AI investment will translate to the company’s bottom line. But while details are still thin, Zuckerberg made it clear that the AI lab’s work would reach the public soon.\n“This is going to be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward,” he told investors.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nMark Zuckerberg spoke about his ambitions for Meta’s AI smart glasses business during Meta’s Q4 2025 earnings call on Wednesday.\nAfter pivoting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is doubling down on its production of AI wearables, as well as its own AI models.\n“Billions of people wear glasses or contacts for vision correction. And I think that we’re at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”\nHe added that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, and he believes that they’re “some of the fastest growing consumer electronics in history.”\nTake Zuckerberg’s outlook with a grain of salt. After all, he also thought that we would go to work and hang out with our friends in the metaverse — legs optional — and that didn’t work out.\nBut based on how tech’s biggest players are allocating their money and effort, it does seem like AI glasses are poised for a big moment, even if it’s not on the scale of the smartphone.\nGoogle is expected to launch a line of smart glasses this year, following a $150 million deal with Warby Parker. Apple is also reportedly planning to unveil smart glasses in the next year or two, moving some staff to that project instead of working on a lighter Vision Pro, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Snap announced Tuesday that it would spin its AR glasses, Specs, into a new subsidiary to allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEven OpenAI, a company that has not yet ventured into hardware, is pursuing AI wearables, though it seems more focused on something like an AI pin or earbuds, rather than glasses. Apple is also rumored to be working on an AirTag-sized AI device — though hopefully those efforts turn out better than the Humane AI pin.\nFor now, Meta is leading the way in pushing smart glasses to market, with several different models already on sale. That includes Oakley smart glasses designed to be worn while exercising, which is the most promising use case we’ve personally seen for these devices thus far.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nMeta announced Wednesday that it will charge developers for running chatbots on WhatsApp in regions where regulators are forcing the company to allow them. The move comes after the company’s ban on third-party chatbots on WhatsApp took effect on January 15. \nFor now, Meta will charge developers in Italy, where the country’s competition watchdog asked the company to suspend its policy last December. The company said that the new pricing for non-template responses will begin on February 16. Meta plans to charge $0.0691/ €0.0572 / £0.0498 per message to developers for AI responses. This could result in steep bills for developers if users are exchanging thousands of queries with AI chatbots every day.\nEarlier this month, Meta sent notices to developers creating an exemption for Italian phone numbers and allowing AI chatbots to serve those customers. At that time, the company didn’t mention any plans to charge developers.\nCurrently, WhatsApp already charges companies for using its API for various template responses to customers, which include use cases like marketing, utility, or authentication. This includes messages users receive about payment reminders and shipping updates. \n“Where we are legally required to provide AI chatbots through the WhatsApp business API, we are introducing pricing for the companies that choose to use our platform to provide those services,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. This could also establish a precedent for other geographies if Meta has to cave in and allow developers to operate their chatbots.\nMeta first announced this past October that it would block all third-party AI chatbots from using WhatsApp through its WhatsApp Business API. \nMeta said its systems weren’t designed to handle responses from AI bots and were being strained. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites, and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform,” the company said at that time.\nSince then, various regions, including the EU, Italy, and Brazil, have started anticompetitive probes. Brazil’s watchdog initially asked Meta to suspend the policy. However, a court in Brazil sided with Meta last week and overturned the preliminary order blocking the new policy. As a result, the company has asked developers not to provide their AI chatbots to users in Brazil, TechCrunch has learned. \nSince the policy has kicked in, developers are forced to send a pre-defined message to users of their AI chatbot on WhatsApp to redirect them to their site or app. Providers like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft announced last year that their WhatsApp bots would not work after January 15, urging users to access them on other platforms.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI data-labeling startup Handshake has acquired data label-auditing startup Cleanlab, the companies tell TechCrunch.\nHandshake began in 2013 as a platform for hiring college grads and launched a human data-labeling business about a year ago to serve foundational AI model companies. Cleanlab, founded in 2021, is a startup that provides software for improving the quality of data produced by human labelers.\nThe deal’s purpose is primarily to acquire talent, aka an acqui-hire, adding nine key Cleanlab employees to Handshake’s research organization. This includes the startup’s co-founders, who earned their PhDs in computer science from MIT: Curtis Northcutt (pictured above), Jonas Mueller, and Anish Athalye. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed (though, as we previously reported, sometimes an acqui-hire can be surprisingly lucrative for founders.)\nCleanlab has raised a total of $30 million from investors, including Menlo Ventures, TQ Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Databricks Ventures. At its peak, the startup had more than 30 employees.\nCleanlab’s researchers are experts in developing algorithms that flag incorrect data without a second human reviewer. The goal is to improve the quality of the data Handshake produces for AI labs.\n“We have an in-house research team that thinks a lot about where our models are weak, what data should we be producing? How high quality is that data?” Sahil Bhaiwala, chief strategy and innovation officer at Handshake told TechCrunch. “The Cleanlab team has been focusing on this problem for years.”\nNorthcutt, the Cleanlab CEO who’s credited with pioneering its automated data-labeling auditing, said the company received acquisition interest from other AI data-labeling companies. But the startup chose to sell to Handshake because, he said, data-labeling competitors, including Mercor, Surge, and Scale AI, frequently use Handshake’s platform to source human experts such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists for their data-labeling projects.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“If you’re going to pick one, you should probably pick the source, not the middleman,” Northcutt told TechCrunch.\nHandshake, which was last valued at $3.3 billion in 2022, was forecasted to end 2025 at $300 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) and is reportedly on track to reach an ARR of “high hundreds of millions” this year. The company has provided data for eight top AI labs, including OpenAI.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nServiceNow announced a deal with major AI player Anthropic just a week after it announced a partnership with OpenAI.\nEnterprise workflow software company ServiceNow has entered into a multi-year deal with AI research lab Anthropic on Wednesday. This partnership involves further embedding of Anthropic’s AI models into ServiceNow’s platform for its customers and bringing Anthropic’s AI to its employees.\nServiceNow declined to clarify the duration of the partnership or the monetary size of the deal.\nThis deal entails making Anthropic’s Claude model family the preferred AI models across ServiceNow’s AI-driven workflow products. Claude is now also the default model powering the company’s AI agent builder, ServiceNow Build Agent, which allows developers to create agentic workflows and build apps.\nThe deal also involves the rollout of Claude to the company’s 29,000 ServiceNow employees. Claude Code, Anthropic’s vibe-coding product, is also available to the company’s engineers.\n“ServiceNow with Anthropic is turning intelligence into action through AI-native workflows for the world’s largest enterprises,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow, said in a company press release. “Together, we are proving that deeply integrated platforms with an open ecosystem are how the future is built.”\nThis news comes just a week after the company announced a new AI partnership with Anthropic rival OpenAI that involved giving ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI’s models through the company’s products.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nServiceNow president, COO and CPO, Amit Zavery, said the company is intentionally pursuing a multi-model strategy.\n“We don’t view these partnerships as competitive or mutually exclusive,” Zavery said over email. “Enterprise customers want model choice. They want the right model for the right job — keeping governance, security, and auditability consistent on the ServiceNow AI Platform. Each model brings different strengths, and our role is to orchestrate them in ways that deliver the best outcomes for customers.”\nThis deal is just the latest one for Anthropic, which has announced a number of sizable enterprise deals in recent months. The company announced a deal with global insurance provider Allianz earlier this year and partnerships with Accenture, IBM, Deloitte, and Snowflake late last year.\nWhile enterprises have struggled thus far to find a measurable return on AI investment, VCs recently predicted that this will change in 2026 — although this is the third year in a row they have predicted that.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nTesla is ending production of the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday during the company’s quarterly earnings call. \nThe company will make the final versions of both electric vehicles next quarter, he said, adding that his company will offer support for existing Model S and Model X owners “for as long as people have the vehicles.”\n“It’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we’re really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,” he said. “So if you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.”\nThe Model S and Model X are both built at the company’s Fremont, California factory. Once production ends, Tesla will build Optimus robots in the same factory space, according to Musk. Production of Tesla’s Cybertruck, which is made at the company’s factory outside of Austin, will continue.\nTesla launched the Model S in 2012, and it’s regarded as the first car that made electric vehicles widely appealing. The Model X was Tesla’s second major electric vehicle program.\nTesla always intended for its more affordable models — the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV — to greatly outsell their predecessors. \nBut sales of both models have flatlined in recent years, despite interior and exterior refreshes along the way. Tesla has faced increased competition in the luxury EV space from legacy automakers, as well as upstarts like Rivian and Lucid Motors.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So that is slightly sad, but it’s… it is time to bring the S and X programs to an end,” Musk said.\nTesla’s first ground-up design\nThe Model S was not Tesla’s first car — that title goes to the original Roadster. But the Model S was the first car Tesla created from the ground up. \nThat helped it ditch a lot of the tradeoffs of the Roadster, and paved the way for the Model S to become one of the first true mass-market electric vehicles.\nTesla launched the sedan in 2012 with a base price of $57,400. It had a floor-mounted battery that helped make it roomier and far more dynamic to drive than the few other all-electric vehicles that were available at the time.\nTesla also offered the Model S with multiple battery sizes, allowing customers to pay up for more EV range. \nThe car was instantly popular, with Tesla collecting more than 10,000 reservations for it by the time the first deliveries started in June of that year. By 2013, it had become MotorTrend’s car of the year, beating out the best gas cars from around the world.\n“At its core, the Tesla Model S is simply a damned good car you happen to plug in to refuel,” MotorTrend wrote.\nTesla iterated on the Model S in the years that followed. It changed up battery options — at one point even offering larger battery packs with range that was software-limited, in a bid to get customers to adopt a sort of “buy now pay later” attitude. \nThe Model S was also the first Tesla to get “Ludicrous Mode,” which made it possible to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h in just 2.8 seconds. It was an exhilarating feature that also became one of Tesla’s sharpest word-of-mouth marketing tools.\nTesla kept improving the Model S, giving it industry-leading range that still beats most other EVs and an overall exterior and interior refresh in 2021. But by that point the company’s success had skyrocketed on the backs of the much cheaper Model 3 and Model Y. \nThe Fabergé SUV\nThe Model X was not so straightforward. \nFirst teased before the release of the Model S in 2012, the Model X SUV didn’t hit the streets until 2015. When it did, it arrived with overly complex “Falcon Wing” rear doors that folded up. \nThese made it extremely easy to get in and out of the Model X. But the doors — along with the rest of the SUV — proved to be very hard to build at scale with any reliable quality over the years. Musk eventually called it the “Fabergé of cars.” It was a nod to the luxury stylings and features, but also to the Model X’s brittle nature.\nThe Model X still sold fairly well alongside the S, and it also received a big refresh in 2021. But production problems plagued the new version, too, and Musk admitted in early 2022 that Tesla made a mistake by halting production before the redesigned Model X was ready to be made at scale.\nA long time coming\nIn hindsight, the retirement of the Model S and Model X have been a long time coming. \nMusk himself said in 2019 that Tesla was still making these “niche” vehicles more for “sentimental reasons than anything else.” \n“They are really of minor importance to our future,” Musk said at the time. \nAt that point, Tesla was still selling tens of thousands of Model S and Model X SUVs per quarter. But the company’s first truly new model was on the horizon: the Cybertruck.\nRevealed in 2019, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. The company stated it would sell a base version for $40,000, and make 250,000 of them a year. Delays brought on by the Covid pandemic, along with the vehicle’s complex new design, meant the vehicle hit the market far later than anticipated.\nOnce it did hit the road, the Cybertruck bombed — although Tesla continues to publicly support it, including during Wednesday’s earnings call. A supposed backlog of 2 million orders never materialized, and neither did the $40,000 base price. Tesla has struggled to sell just a few thousand of them per quarter ever since.\nThe Cybertruck’s failure likely gave the Model S and Model X some cover. Not only did the two legacy EVs help slightly offset the garish truck’s terrible popularity, Tesla also bucketed the three vehicles as “other models” when reporting quarterly sales figures, making it hard to say just how badly the Cybertruck was doing.\nBut Tesla is now a company aimed at solving autonomy in cars, and in robots, according to Musk. That’s apparently what ultimately did in the Model S and Model X. \nThey may have been of “minor importance” to [Tesla’s] future seven years ago. But they will always be crucial to the company’s early years, and the construction of Musk as an uber-rich businessman who now looms over modern society.\n"

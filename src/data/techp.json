The round was led by SoftBank, and Nvidia, Macquarie Group, 1789 Capital, and others also invested.\nSkild AI last raised funding at a $4.5 billion valuation this prior summer, Bloomberg reported. The company hasn’t disclosed the exact value of that round — it was rumored to be around $500 million — but Skild AI CEO Deepak Pathak told Bloomberg that the company has now raised more than $2 billion to date.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Skild AI for more information on its fundraising history, and we’ll update this piece when we hear more.\nFounded in 2023, Skild AI builds general-purpose robotic software and foundation models that can be retrofitted to a variety of different robots and tasks without requiring a ton of additional training. The hope is that these models can also learn from watching humans perform tasks.\nThere has been a big push recently into this type of learn-as-you-go robotic software alongside the rising hype around humanoids.\nOne of the biggest hurdles in robot adoption for both personal and industrial use cases is the sheer amount of training required for robots to learn each and every new task. Being able to learn and adapt as they go would clear the path for more robotic adoption.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nField AI is another startup looking to build easily adapted robotic software.

The update is rolling out on desktop starting today.\nThe Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.\nThe redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration. \nImage Credits:Google\n​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.\nA Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.\n​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nWith news that Discord is kicking the tires on going public soon, other tech companies are starting to take their chances. Liftoff Mobile filed its first S-1 document late Tuesday, the first step in the process.\nThe company isn’t yet discussing how big this IPO will be: It has not yet filled in any data about the size of the offering or the stakes held by its principal shareholders. However, the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.\nAnother interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.\nLiftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.\n"

    "body": "\nCybercriminals are increasingly using AI in their attacks. At the same time, cyber defenders are also turning to the technology to fight back. Depthfirst, a security startup positioning itself at the forefront of this AI-powered defense, announced Wednesday that it had raised $40 million in a Series A round.\nFounded in October 2024, the company raised the round from Accel Partners, which led the investment, with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital.\nDepthfirst offers a platform called General Security Intelligence, an AI-native suite that helps companies scan and analyze their codebases and workflows for signs of trouble. The company says that the platform also allows companies to protect themselves from credential exposures and to monitor threats to their open source and third-party components.\nThe company plans to use the new capital to hire additional staff for applied research and engineering, as well as product and sales. \n“We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” said Qasim Mithani, the company’s co-founder and CEO, as part of the announcement. Mithani, who previously worked for Databricks and Amazon, added that automation has changed how bad actors execute their attacks. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.”\nThe company’s leadership comes with backgrounds in both AI and security. One of depthfirst’s other co-founders, Daniele Perito, previously served as director of security and risk engineering at Square, which is part of Jack Dorsey’s Block. Its CTO (and another co-founder), Andrea Michi, was previously an engineer at Google DeepMind.\nJust as AI can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used by cybercriminals to automate a whole range of malicious processes — from writing malware to social engineering attacks to scanning for vulnerabilities to exploit. Last November, Anthropic claimed that it had thwarted the first “AI orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDepthfirst says it can help protect companies from many of these “AI-driven exploits,” and that it has already developed partnerships with a number of prominent companies, including AngelList, Lovable, and Moveworks. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

These features are also available for adults, who can opt to set their own limits and reminders.\nFor parents who also use YouTube, it can be challenging to move back and forth between an adult’s account and kid’s account — unless if you want your algorithm to be forever usurped by Bluey. In the coming weeks, YouTube says it will update the sign-up experience within the app to make it easier for parents and kids to toggle between their accounts with just a few taps… of course, that requires the parent or child to actually remember to make the switch.\nThese features build upon YouTube’s existing parental controls for teens, which include the ability to supervise a teen’s channel activity if they’re making content. This has become industry standard, as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook have similar controls.\nLast year, YouTube also unveiled age-estimation technology to predict if an account belongs to a teen so that it can provide a more age-appropriate experience. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nShortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.\nIn a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”\nOwens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.\nShe also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.\nAfter TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.\nIn a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”\nIn a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOwens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”\nThe Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.\nEven if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.\nShe is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”\nAlthough Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\nWhile many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.\nThe problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.\nThat means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.\nUntil then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.\n"

    "body": "\nOver the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out. \n“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit. \nChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.\nFor anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.  \nSomani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over one thousand conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.  \nSince Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process. \nThe revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOn Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”\n“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.\nAnother driving force is a recent shift towards formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open-source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization. \nFor Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.” \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThe music distribution platform Bandcamp announced in a Reddit post on Tuesday that it’s banning AI-generated music and audio.\n“We want musicians to keep making music, and for fans to have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans,” the company said.\nBandcamp’s new guidelines state that music and audio generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI” is not permitted and that it will not allow the use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles.\nSo, if Drake had released “Taylor Made Freestyle” on Bandcamp, he would’ve had a problem (and maybe it would’ve been for his own good).\nAs AI music generators like Suno become more sophisticated, it’s become harder to avoid synthetic music — songs created with AI tools have topped charts on Spotify and Billboard. AI music now sounds real enough that it can be difficult to decipher how it was made.\nIn one high-profile example, Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed To Know.” Her AI “persona,” Xania Monet, received multiple bids for record deals before signing with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\nThe legality of AI-generated music is up in the air. Suno is currently facing lawsuits from major labels Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, which allege the company trained its AI on copyrighted material from the labels.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis hasn’t deterred Silicon Valley, though. Suno raised a $250 million Series C round in November, which valued the company at $2.4 billion. While the raise was led by Menlo Ventures, Suno saw participation from Hallwood Media, the company backing Xania Monet.\nThe legal outlook doesn’t look good for artists. In a recent lawsuit, a judge ruled that Anthropic could use copyrighted books that it downloaded illegally to train its AI. What was illegal, the judge said, was that Anthropic pirated the books that it fed into its AI models. The company got a $1.5 billion slap on the wrist, which isn’t very significant for a company that’s valued at $183 billion.\nUnlike Spotify or Apple Music, Bandcamp doesn’t pay artists per stream. Instead, Bandcamp allows artists to sell their music digitally alongside physical products like merch and CDs. \nBandcamp only makes money from its cut of artists’ sales — but even if it presents itself as an artist-first distributor, a tech company is still a tech company, and the bottom line matters. Looking at Bandcamp’s move optimistically, perhaps the company is confirming what artists hope to be true: No one is actually spending money to buy AI-generated music, at least not on Bandcamp.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Wednesday that it’s launching a new beta feature in the Gemini app that allows the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. \nAlthough Gemini could already retrieve information from these apps, it can now reason across your data to provide proactive results, such as connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched. Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look.\nThe tech giant notes that this beta experience, called Personal Intelligence, is off by default, as users have the option to choose if and when they want to connect their Google apps to Gemini. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says. \n“Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a blog post. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.”\nWoodward shared an example of when he was standing in line at a tire shop and didn’t remember his car’s tire size. While most AI chatbots can determine a car’s tire size, Woodward says Gemini can go further by offering personalized responses. In his case, Gemini suggested all-weather tires after identifying family road trip photos in Google Photos. Woodward also said he forgot his license plate number, but Gemini was able to pull the number from a picture in Photos. \nImage Credits:Google\n“I’ve also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it’s been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break. By analyzing our family’s interests and past trips in Gmail and Photos, it skipped the tourist traps. Instead, it suggested an overnight train journey and specific board games we could play along the way.”\nGoogle says it has guardrails for sensitive topics, as Gemini will avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like health. However, the tech giant also notes that Gemini will discuss this data if you ask it to. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, Gemini doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses. In the examples above, the photos of the road trip, the license plate picture in Photos, and the emails in Gmail are not directly used to train the model. They are only referenced to generate a response, Google says.\nPersonal Intelligence is rolling out to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Google plans to expand the feature to more countries and Gemini’s free tier. \nGoogle provided a list of example prompts to try, including “Help me plan my weekend in [city i.e. New York] based on things I like to do,” “Recommend some documentaries based on what I’ve been curious about,” or “Based on my delivery and grocery receipts in Gmail, Search history, and YouTube watch history, recommend 5 YouTube channels that match my cooking style or meal prep vibe.”\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFusion power startup Type One Energy recently raised $87 million, TechCrunch has learned from sources familiar with the deal.\nThe new funding is a convertible note that brings the total venture investment in the startup to more than $160 million. Type One is also in the midst of raising a $250 million Series B at a $900 million pre-money valuation, according to sources and later confirmed by the company.\nLike other energy startups, Type One has benefited from a surge in demand from data centers and the broader electrification of the economy. Data centers are expected to use nearly three times more electricity by 2035, while overall electricity demand is forecast to grow by 4% annually through next year.\nFusion power could deliver gigawatts’ worth of nearly limitless clean power. The reactors work by fusing atoms, which release tremendous amounts of heat and energy in the process. Power plants harvest that heat to spin turbines, similar to today’s fossil fuel facilities, but without the pollution.\nUnlike fission, fusion reactors don’t produce significant amounts of radioactive waste. They also don’t pose a risk of catastrophic meltdowns.\nThere are two main approaches to fusion power: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. In the former, magnets compress and control plasma, the superheated particles that ultimately fuse into new atoms. In the latter, fuel pellets are compressed until they fuse, most often using lasers.\nType One will employ magnetic confinement, and the design is what’s known as a stellarator. In a stellarator, magnets are arranged in a doughnut shape that’s twisted and turned according to the demands of the plasma. Previously built stellarators have been able to control plasma for long periods of time, though none have been built yet with the intention of producing power.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast year, Type One signed deals with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to place the startup’s first commercial power plant at the site of the former Bull Run Fossil Plant, a coal-fired power plant that was retired in 2023. Infinity Two, as the power plant is called, is expected to generate 350 megawatts of electricity and could come online in the mid-2030s, the company has said.\nUnlike many other startups, Type One isn’t planning to build the power plants or reactors itself and sell the power. Instead, the company will sell key technology to the TVA and power providers, who will build, own, and operate the plants. \nType One had previously raised a $29 million seed round in 2023 that was extended to a total of $82.5 million in 2024. Investors in that round included Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and TDK Ventures.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThere are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, and an increasing number of them are able to capture all types of images in near real time. \nIt used to be a somewhat cumbersome process to access those images. But Austin-based startup SkyFi has built a platform that acts as a sort of “Getty Images” for more than 50 geospatial imagery partners that has proven popular in the worlds of finance, defense, infrastructure, and insurance — to name a few.\nThat popularity escalated as SkyFi began offering more analytics and insights to its customers through its website and mobile app, along with the ability to “task” satellites to capture images of a location at a specific time, CEO Luke Fischer recently told TechCrunch in an interview.\n“I think the real goal for us is providing answers for customers, both government and commercial,” Fischer said. “Imagery is a commodity, or it’s closely becoming a commodity, [so it’s] not just about speed of delivery, but more importantly, speed of delivery of answers to customers.”\nBeing able to offer insights along with easy-to-access imagery is a big reason why SkyFi was just able to close a $12.7 million Series A funding round, according to Fischer. \nThat’s reflected in the investor makeup of the round. It was co-led by climate-focused fund Buoyant Ventures and IronGate Capital Advisors, which invests in dual-use companies. Other investors included DNV Ventures (the investment arm of 160-year-old maritime company DNV), Beyond Earth Ventures (a space-focused firm), and TFX Capital (which has made a number of defense-related space investments).\nFischer said he and co-founder Bill Perkins — who comes from the hedge fund world, hence the emphasis on generating actionable insights — initially only sought to raise a round of about $8 million. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut 2025 was a record year for defense-related investments, and SkyFi received more investor demand than expected, Fischer said. The company upped its target to $10 million, and again to $12 million, before arriving at the $12.7 million figure after some strategic investors joined the round. (One was DNV; Fischer declined to name the other on the record.) \nFischer said SkyFi used to have a harder time convincing satellite imagery providers to hand over access to their data. Now, he said, onboarding new providers is “table stakes.” \n“It took a little bit for us to get to this point, [but] we have the largest virtual constellation of assets. That means we have all the data supply in the world for us, all the different sensor types,” he said. SkyFi has been able to leverage all of that data and, crucially, the many requests it’s received from customers over the last few years to build up analytical offerings worth selling to commercial and government customers.\n“We know better than anyone what they’re asking for,” he said.\nFischer said he learned firsthand how powerful this kind of feedback loop can be from his time helping lead Uber’s Elevate division.\n“Uber has data on where people move in the world. They layer different products, the bikes, the scooters, the electric aircraft, the drone delivery. We have that equivalent data on what people are looking at in the world they’re asking of that data,” he said. “It gives us a much better purview. And again. We’re software first, so I don’t have the burden of having to pay for hardware capital expenses.”\nSome of those customers will want to do their own analytics, like the hedge funds, Fischer explained. But most are increasingly interested in what SkyFi has to offer on the insights side, he said. \nThe company plans to use the new funding to expand on all this, though Fischer is clearly proud of building a product that is deeply capable but inherently approachable, to the point that even his family uses the product.\n“My teenage daughters task satellites for their high school, and now college, homework on their iPhones,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nAmmonia might be the world’s most underappreciated chemical. Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.\nHumans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, Ammobia, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.\nTo prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.\nIf the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer. \nAmmonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to decarbonize a range of industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t as energy dense and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.\n“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”\nBut those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.\nFossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH4) found in natural gas.\nAmmobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.\nThe startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.\nThat could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.\nAmmobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each. \nBecause Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.\n“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”\nThe reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.\nAmmobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a patent pending on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including manganese nitride, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.\nThe startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.\n“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe subscription economy helped boost mobile app revenues in 2025, even as app downloads declined for the fifth consecutive year, according to app intelligence firm Appfigures‘ annual report. In 2025, global downloads of all mobile apps and mobile games via the App Store and Google Play reached an estimated 106.9 billion, 2.7% lower than the year prior. Consumer spending, meanwhile, climbed 21.6% to reach an estimated $155.8 billion during the same period. \nThe data indicates that app developers, marketers, and publishers have been successful in getting their users to make in-app purchases or activate subscriptions, even as the number of new users downloading apps has been falling.\n\n\nThe report also reflected the continued shift away from mobile games as the primary revenue driver for the app economy. In 2025, consumers spent $72.2 billion on mobile games, accounting for about 46% of all spending within mobile apps. While that figure is up 10% year-over-year, spending on non-game mobile apps also increased. In fact, non-game app spending is up 33.9% year-over-year and reached $82.6 billion in 2025, Appfigures said.\nWhile consumers may not like that nearly every app now has in-app purchases or a subscription model built in, this has offered a more sustainable path for app developers. Plus, the shift toward ongoing payments for apps has helped fuel an ecosystem of businesses serving the mobile app ecosystem. This includes subscription management platform RevenueCat, which raised a $50 million Series C this past year, and Appcharge, a startup helping mobile games improve their monetization, which announced a $58 million Series B back in August. This week, Liftoff Mobile, which helps market and monetize apps, filed for an IPO. \nAs revenue rose, downloads dropped again in 2025. \nAfter reaching an all-time high of 135 billion in 2020 during the pandemic, downloads have been on the decline. This year’s figure of 106.9 billion installs was down from 109.8 billion in 2024, and follows slowed download growth between 2023 and 2024, when installs were down 3.3%. \nMobile game downloads saw a larger decline this year. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, down 8.6% year-over-year, after a 6.6% decline from 2023 to 2024. Non-game app downloads were essentially flat — they only saw a slight increase of 1.1% year-over-year, reaching 67.4 billion. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nThe full report also takes a look at the U.S. market specifically. Here, consumers spent an estimated $55.5 billion across all mobile apps, up 18.1% year-over-year from $47 billion in 2024. Downloads reached 10 billion, down 4.2% from the 10.4 billion in 2024. U.S. consumers spent $33.6 billion on non-game apps, up 26.8% year-over-year, and spent $21.9 billion on games, up just 6.8%.\nU.S. non-game app downloads were an estimated 7.1 billion in 2025, while games were downloaded 2.9 billion times.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAlthough public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.\nMicrosoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.\n“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”\nThe company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.\nIt’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.\nThis backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nConcerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”\nIn short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

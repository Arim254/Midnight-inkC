    "body": "<div>\n<p><br />Professional services and consultant firm Deloitte announced a landmark AI enterprise deal with Anthropic the same day it was revealed the company would issue a refund for a government-contracted report that contained inaccurate AI-produced slop.  </p>\n<p>The upshot: Deloitte’s deal with Anthropic is a referendum on its commitment to AI, even as it grapples with the technology. And Deloitte is not alone in this challenge. </p>\n<p>The timing of this announcement is interesting — comical even. On the same day Deloitte touted its increased use of AI, the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/934cc94b-32c4-497e-9718-d87d6a7835ca\" target=\"_blank\">consulting company would have to issue a refund</a> for a report it did for the department that included AI hallucinations, the Financial Times reported.  </p>\n<p>The department had commissioned a A$439,000 “independent assurance review” from Deloitte, which was published earlier this year. The Australian Financial Review reported in August the review had a number of errors, including multiple citations to non-existent academic reports. A corrected version of the review was uploaded to the department’s website last week. Deloitte will repay the final installment of its government contract, the FT reported.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch reached out to Deloitte for comment and will update the article if the company responds.</p>\n<p>Deloitte announced Monday plans roll out Anthropic’s chatbot Claude to its nearly 500,000 global employees on Monday. Deloitte and Anthropic, which formed a partnership last year, plan to create compliance products and features for regulated industries including financial services, healthcare and public services, according to an <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/deloitte-anthropic-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic blog post</a>. Deloitte also plans to create different AI agent “personas” to represent the different departments within the company including accountants and software developers, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/anthropic-deloitte-enterprise-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to reporting from CNBC</a>.  </p>\n<p>“Deloitte is making this significant investment in Anthropic’s AI platform because our approach to responsible AI is very aligned, and together we can reshape how enterprises operate over the next decade. Claude continues to be a leading choice for many clients and our own AI transformation,” Ranjit Bawa, global technology and ecosystems and alliances leader, at Deloitte wrote in the blog post.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The financial terms of the deal — which Anthropic referred to as an alliance — were not disclosed.  </p>\n<p>The deal is not only Anthropic’s largest enterprise deployment yet, it also illustrates how AI is embedding itself in every aspect of modern life from tools used at work to casual queries made at home. </p>\n<p>Deloitte is not the only company, or individual, getting caught using inaccurate AI-produced information in recent months either. </p>\n<p>In May, the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/chicago-sun-admits-summer-book-guide-included-fake-ai-generated-titles-rcna208325\" target=\"_blank\">had to admit that it ran an AI-generated list of books</a> for its annual summer reading list after readers discovered some of the book titles were hallucinated even if the authors were real. An internal document viewed by Business Insider showed Amazon’s AI productivity tool, Q Business, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-q-significantly-behind-rivals-accuracy-first-year-2025-10\">struggled with accuracy</a> in its first year. </p>\n<p>Anthropic itself has also been knocked for using <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/anthropics-lawyer-was-forced-to-apologize-after-claude-hallucinated-a-legal-citation/\" target=\"_blank\">AI-hallucinated information from its own chatbot</a> Claude. The AI research lab’s lawyer apologized after the company used an AI-generated citation in a legal dispute with music publishers earlier this year. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

But Lucid Motors has seen deliveries steadily climb over the last two years. The third-quarter delivery figures <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000162828025044292/q3fy25ex991-productionandd.htm\" target=\"_blank\">announced Monday</a> mark the seventh consecutive quarter that Lucid Motors has seen sales increase.</p>\n<p>Lucid Motors was not alone in seeing a big third-quarter bump in EV sales. Tesla recorded its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/tesla-has-its-best-sales-quarter-of-2025-as-ev-tax-credit-expires/\" target=\"_blank\">best quarter in company history</a>, and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors saw big increases as well. Even Rivian, which is forecasting a worse overall year for total EV deliveries than 2024 or 2023, saw a boost in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Like Rivian, only customers who leased Lucid Motors vehicles were eligible for the federal EV tax credit, meaning the impact of its expiration is hard to quantify. It’s also unclear how many Gravity SUVs were delivered compared to the company’s first model, the Air sedan. Lucid Motors will reveal full financial results for the quarter on November 5.</p>\n<p>Lucid Motors has struggled to generate interest for its luxury EVs since going public in 2021, with former CEO Peter Rawlinson openly admitting the company needed to beef up its marketing operations. Earlier this year, the company announced it <a href=\"https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-joins-forces-academy-award-nominees-timothee-chalamet-and\" target=\"_blank\">signed actor Timothée Chalamet</a> to be its first “global ambassador.” The company has also benefited from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/lucids-record-quarter-got-a-lift-from-rental-sales-and-company-leases/\" target=\"_blank\">rental sales and company leases in some quarters</a>, as TechCrunch previously reported.</p>\n<p>The company is also increasingly looking to Saudi Arabia — which owns around 60% of the publicly traded company through its sovereign wealth fund — as a market for its vehicles. On Monday, Lucid Motors said it built more than 1,000 vehicles specifically for the Saudi market. (The company currently operates an assembly facility in the Kingdom and plans to open a full-fledged factory there.)</p>\n<p>Lucid has also locked in future demand from an unlikely customer: Uber. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Uber announced last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\" target=\"_blank\">plans</a> to buy at least 20,000 Gravity SUVs over the next six years and use them as robotaxis on its network.

Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-shutting-down-program-that-pays-creators-influencers-ads-profiles-2025-1\" target=\"_blank\">Meta shut down</a> a program that paid creators for ads placed in their profiles. In 2023, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/10/meta-will-stop-offering-reels-bonuses-to-creators-on-facebook-and-instagram/\">company stopped offering bonuses</a> to Reels creators on Instagram and Facebook. The company also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-ending-affiliate-marketing-incentive-bonus-for-influencers-creators-2022-6\" target=\"_blank\">shut down its affiliate marketing</a> bonuses in 2022. </p>\n<p>The launch of the new awards program also comes as creators saw a 52% decrease in brand deals in 2024, according to a survey from <a href=\"https://kajabi.com/state-of-creator-commerce-25\" target=\"_blank\">Kajabi</a>. Additionally, Bank of America said last year that along with a slowdown in sponsored partnerships, there’s <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/11/17/content-creator-economy-influencers-paid-partnerships-brand-deals/\" target=\"_blank\">competition in the space</a>, as more paid partnerships are concentrated among the top creators.</p>\n<p>Given these recent shifts, it’s interesting to see Instagram launch a symbolic awards program that doesn’t offer any monetary compensation to recipients. Instead, it’s focused on creating an awards program that’s supposed to be like the Oscars for content creators (without an actual ceremony). </p>\n<p>The company said in the blog post that the award is “all about celebrating those who aren’t afraid to take creative chances and do it their way. Those who bring people together over their creativity, and deserve recognition.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Winners will be announced on October 16. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI unveiled new API updates at its Dev Day on Monday, introducing GPT-5 Pro, its latest language model, its new video generation model Sora 2, and a smaller, cheaper voice model.  </p>\n<p>The updates were part of a series of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\" target=\"_blank\">announcements</a> geared toward wooing developers to OpenAI’s ecosystem, including the launch of an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-agentkit-to-help-developers-build-and-ship-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\">agent-building tool</a> and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\">ability to build apps in ChatGPT</a>. </p>\n<p>The addition of GPT-5 Pro might appeal to developers building applications in finance, legal, and healthcare — industries that need “high accuracy and depth of reasoning,” per OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. </p>\n<p>Altman also noted that voice capabilities will be essential in the future as it quickly becomes one of the primary ways people use to interact with AI. To that end, OpenAI is launching “gpt-realtime mini,” a smaller, cheaper voice model in API that supports low-latency streaming interactions for audio and speech. The new model is 70% cheaper than OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/\" target=\"_blank\">previous advanced voice model</a> but promises the “same voice quality and expressiveness.” </p>\n<p>Finally, creators involved in OpenAI’s developer ecosystem can now tap into Sora 2 in preview in the API. OpenAI released Sora 2, its latest audio and video generator, last week alongside the Sora app, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">a TikTok competitor</a> filled with short AI-generated videos. The Sora app allows users to generate videos of themselves, friends, or anything based on a prompt, and share it via a TikTok-style algorithmic feed.  </p>\n<p>“[Developers] now have access to the same model that powers Sora 2’s stunning video outputs right in your own app,” Altman said. </p>\n<p>Sora 2 builds on its previous generation with more realistic, physically consistent scenes with synchronized sound and greater creative control — from detailed camera direction to stylized visuals.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“For example, you can take the iPhone view and prompt Sora to expand it into a sweeping, cinematic wide shot,” Altman said. “But one of the most exciting things that we’ve been working on is how well this new model pairs sound with visuals, not just speech, but rich soundscapes, ambient audio, synchronized effects that are grounded in what you’re seeing.” </p>\n<p>Sora 2 is pitched as a tool for concept development, whether it’s a visual starting point for an ad based on the general vibe of a product, or a Mattel designer turning a sketch into a toy concept — an example Altman provided at Dev Day that sheds light on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/openai-and-barbie-maker-mattel-team-up-to-bring-generative-ai-to-toy-making-and-content-creation/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s deal with the Barbie-maker</a> to bring generative AI into the toy-making pipeline.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Top YouTube creator MrBeast is worried about AI’s impact on creators’ livelihoods, despite having dabbled with using the technology himself. On Monday, the creator posted his concerns on social media, where he openly wondered how AI-generated videos could affect the “millions of creators currently making content for a living.”</p>\n<p>“Scary times,” he added.</p>\n<p>MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is No. 1 on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2025/06/16/forbes-top-creators-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes’ 2025 list of top creators</a>, with $85 million in earnings and 634 million followers. What he says and does, as a result of his position, has an outsized influence across the industry. So if MrBeast is openly questioning whether AI is an existential threat to his business and others like it, then it’s fair to say that smaller creators are likely even more worried.</p>\n<p>His comments follow the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">recent launch of OpenAI’s Sora 2,</a> a new version of its audio and video generator, alongside a mobile app that lets users create AI, including videos of themselves, which are shared in a TikTok-style vertical feed. The app has been an early hit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/openais-sora-soars-to-no-1-on-the-u-s-app-store/\">quickly hitting No. 1 on the U.S. App Store</a> after a surge of downloads.</p>\n<p>YouTube has also embraced AI, launching things like AI editing tools, including those that let creators <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/21/youtube-shorts-dream-screen-feature-can-now-generate-ai-video-backgrounds/\">generate AI videos</a> using its video model Veo to animate still photos or apply different styles to their videos. The company has infused AI into its product as well, for things like making clips or highlights from Live videos or podcasts. An AI chatbot <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/youtube-rolls-out-studio-updates-likeness-detection-lip-synced-dubs-creator-collabs-and-more/\">can answer creators’ questions</a> inside YouTube’s channel management software, YouTube Studio.</p>\n<p>MrBeast has also involved himself with AI, as commenters were quick to point out. The creator this summer faced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15wvvjv402o\" target=\"_blank\">a fair bit of backlash</a> from fans and creators alike after releasing a tool that used AI to create video thumbnails. He quickly removed the tool from his analytics platform, Viewstats, and said he’d replace it with links to human artists available for commission.</p>\n<p>His company’s philanthropy arm has <a href=\"https://x.com/lightaihealth/status/1891201870439539070\" target=\"_blank\">also made AI investments</a> at times.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>There is still debate as to whether the novelty of AI video creation will turn everyone into a creator, or if the best videos will still need a human’s creative mind to think them up and then prompt the tool correctly. At the same time, there are those who view AI videos as low-quality content, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">often dubbed “slop,”</a> and dislike seeing it in their feeds.</p>\n<p>Even if the AI becomes undetectable at some point in the future, it’s possible that creators revealed to be using it without disclosure could lose their fans’ trust and harm their reputation. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI is launching a new way for developers to build applications inside of ChatGPT. Starting Monday, users in ChatGPT will be able to access interactive applications from companies like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. OpenAI is also launching a preview of the Apps SDK, the developer-facing toolkit to build these apps.</p>\n<p>OpenAI made the announcement at its annual developer conference, DevDay 2025. </p>\n<p>“We want ChatGPT to be a great way for people to make progress, to be more productive, more inventive, to learn faster, to do whatever they’re trying to do in their lives better,” said CEO Sam Altman. “[Apps inside of ChatGPT] will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>The new system is OpenAI’s latest attempt to build an ecosystem of apps around its flagship AI product, ChatGPT. The launch follows OpenAI’s previous attempts to let developers build interactive applications, such as through its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/app-store-for-ai-build-your-own-gpt-and-sell-it-on-openais-gpt-store/\">GPT Store</a>. Unlike that product, which was a separate app store, Monday’s launch puts apps directly in ChatGPT’s responses and lets users call up third-party tools in their everyday conversations. This gives developers better distribution for the apps they build and aims to make a richer experience for users in ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>By typing the names of different apps in ChatGPT, users can draw in content from a variety of services. For example, users can say, “Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram” to call up the Figma app. Users can also call up the Coursera app by asking, “Coursera, can you teach me something about machine learning?”</p>\n<p>In a demo of Zillow’s application, users could prompt ChatGPT in natural language to search for apartments in their area within a specific price range. ChatGPT then pulled up an interactive map showing options, and users could talk with ChatGPT to learn more about each one.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-The-Zillow-App-in-ChatGPT-Product-Mockup-2-RENTING.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Zillow</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>ChatGPT will also surface relevant apps when they could be helpful to a user. If someone asks for a playlist for a party this weekend, ChatGPT may call up the Spotify app in the conversation. In the future, OpenAI says apps like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, and AllTrails will be available in ChatGPT as well. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>OpenAI says the new system is built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows developers to connect their data sources to an AI system. ChatGPT apps can also trigger actions and render a fully interactive UI in the chatbot’s responses. Certain apps are able to display videos in ChatGPT, which will be pinned to the top of the web page and can be altered based on user requests.</p>\n<p>If users are already subscribed to a product, they’ll be able to log in to their account directly in ChatGPT to access certain features. Altman also says OpenAI will support ways to monetize apps inside of ChatGPT in the future, including through the company’s recently launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">Instant Checkout</a> feature in ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>Key questions around apps in ChatGPT will be privacy, and how much data third-party developers will have access to. OpenAI says developers must “collect only the minimum data they need, and be transparent about permissions.” However, it’s unclear whether developers would have access to a user’s entire conversation with ChatGPT, the past few messages, or just the prompt that summoned up the app.</p>\n<p>It’s also unclear how ChatGPT will choose a service between competing companies, such as DoorDash and Instacart. One could imagine how companies could pay to be surfaced in ChatGPT responses, but OpenAI says it plans to prioritize the user experience above all else.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Maxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

The social network also announced that it’s launching the Snap Map-like feature to users in India, following the initial rollout to users in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/instagram-takes-on-snapchat-with-new-instagram-map/\">United States and Canada</a> in August.  </p>\n<p>When the feature first launched, it caused widespread confusion, with numerous <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/how-to-use-instagram-map-and-protect-your-privacy/#:~:text=numerous%20posts%20on%20social%20media%20urging%20users%20to%20turn%20off%20location%20sharing%2C%20incorrectly%20claiming%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20automatically%20turned%20on.\" target=\"_blank\">social media posts</a> urging users to turn off location sharing, <a href=\"https://x.com/CAMTEAMROCKET/status/1953323825438790023\" target=\"_blank\">incorrectly claiming</a> it was enabled by default. At the time, Instagram head Adam Mosseri reassured users that their location is only visible to others if they decide to share it.  </p>\n<p>Now, two months later, Instagram is adding a more prominent indicator at the top of the Map to remind users whether or not they’re sharing their location, or if they have their device location off entirely. There’s also a new indicator that appears under their profile photo in the Notes tray on the DMs page that clarifies if they’re not sharing their location.</p>\n<p>Additionally, users initially believed that tagging a location in their posts meant they were sharing their real-time location on the Map, as their profile picture would appear over the content. However, this isn’t the case as the feature simply pulls in posts with location tags. To reduce confusion, Instagram has now removed profile photos from Map content to make it clear that it does not indicate someone’s current location.</p>\n<p>Instagram is also going to display an educational reminder notifying users that when they add a location tag to a story, Reel, or post, it will populate on the Map. It’s worth noting that this isn’t exactly new, as Instagram already had location tags visible to users in its map view. </p>\n<p>And to make it even clearer, Instagram will now show a preview to show users how their content will look on the Map when they add a location to Instagram content.</p>\n<p>With its new Map feature, Instagram copied yet another popular feature from Snapchat, after cloning the app’s core Stories functionality <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/instagram-stories/\">back in 2016</a>. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>When Instagram announced the feature, it said it’s designed to make it easier for friends to coordinate and link up for hangouts.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Monday that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users, marking an increase of adoption among consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments.  </p>\n<p>ChatGPT’s impressive growth comes as OpenAI is on a race to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/?_thumbnail_id=3054484\" target=\"_blank\">secure as many AI chips</a> and build as much <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">AI infrastructure</a> as possible. In August, OpenAI said it was on the cusp of reaching <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/openai-says-chatgpt-is-on-track-to-reach-700m-weekly-users/\" target=\"_blank\">700 million weekly active users</a>, already an increase from 500 million weekly active users at the end of March. </p>\n<p>“Today, 4 million developers have built with OpenAI,” Altman said. “More than 800 million people use ChatGPT every week, and we process over 6 billion tokens per minute on the API. Thanks to all of you, AI has gone from something people play with to something people build with every day.”</p>\n<p>Altman made the announcement during the keynote presentation for OpenAI’s Dev Day, which also included announcements for new tools for building apps inside of ChatGPT as well as constructing more complex agentic systems.</p>\n<p>“This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with,” Altman said. </p>\n<p>Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT saw unprecedented user growth almost immediately, becoming both the preeminent consumer AI product and one of the fastest-growing online services ever. More recently the tool expanded into proactive services with OpenAI Pulse, sending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\">customized morning briefs</a> to participating users.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sheena Jindal is from Boston. </p>\n<p>She grew up there, attended MIT, and worked at the Boston Consulting Group for several years. She launched a startup, worked at a startup, and then became an investor at Bessemer and Comcast Ventures (CV). </p>\n<p>Last year, her worlds collided when she decided to launch her own fund, <a href=\"https://www.sugarfreecapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sugar Free Capital</a>, a firm that focuses on investing in technical founders from MIT. She nabbed LPs, including the family offices of heavy-hitting tech executives from companies like Nvidia and Citadel, and on Monday announced the closing of Sugar Free’s $32 million inaugural fund. </p>\n<p>One premise of the fund is found in the name. While working at CV, she led dozens of deals but found herself dismayed at the sky-high valuations of the 2021 era. She kept referring to investment opportunities as being “too sugary, in the sense that valuations were too high,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>From there, she started thinking about the innovation of the past few years and how it was focused on optimization. “But we are really entering the age of intelligence,” she said. She designed a thesis around the idea that capturing the age of intelligence would require two things: technical founders, predominantly those with a “systems engineering mindset,” which is what MIT brings, she added, and concentration. </p>\n<p>“The data have shown us historically that venture returns are concentrated among a select group of winners.” </p>\n<p>The focus on MIT also has another reason. Unlike Harvard and Stanford, there isn’t a big class of MIT alumni who are early-stage investors, even though MIT founders often go on to start and work at lucrative companies. “MIT folks go into finance, but they go into more quantitative roles,” she said — more hedge fund and late-stage investing. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>That white space gives Jindal, a rare solo woman GP, an outsized opportunity. She plans to invest in 15 early-stage companies (she’s already backed four), writing checks that range from $1 million to $5 million. The firm focuses on AI native infrastructure and picks a new theme each quarter to focus on. For example, this quarter, she is looking for companies focused on physical AI, data center optimization, and AI agents. </p>\n<p>Sugar Free has already backed a defense company, a gaming company, and a company in workflow automation. Jindal hopes to cut at least four to five checks a year. Much of the inbound is from her reaching out to founders or referrals, but she’s open to cold outreach. </p>\n<p>Overall, Jindal feels lucky about this fund. The fundraising environment was and is hard for many GPs, especially solo ones, and especially women. She said LPs liked that her firm provided good access to MIT talent and had a clear thesis. </p>\n<p>“We are in the transition period between this new world order of AI native technology and the infrastructure and business models of the past,” Jindal said. “I am excited to see how we’re able to harmoniously combine these two in terms of infrastructure, technology, and the human experience, and to me, that’s really exciting.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Monday announced the launch of AgentKit, a toolkit for building and deploying AI agents, at the firm’s Dev Day event.  </p>\n<p>“AgentKit is a complete set of building blocks available in the open AI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said.  </p>\n<p>The launch highlights OpenAI’s push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts.</p>\n<p>AgentKit was one of several announcements at OpenAI’s Dev Day, including the launch of the ability to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">build apps directly inside ChatGPT</a>, which has hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\">800 million weekly active users</a>.  </p>\n<p>AgentKit includes a few core capabilities. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman described as like Canva for building agents.  </p>\n<p>“It’s a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,” Altman said. “It’s built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use.” </p>\n<p>The second capability of AgentKit is ChatKit, which provides a simple embeddable chat interface that developers can use to bring chat experiences into their own apps.  </p>\n<p>“You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique,” Altman said. </p>\n<p>Evals for Agents introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform. </p>\n<p>Finally, AgentKit includes access to OpenAI’s connector registry, so developers can securely connect agents to internal tools and third-party systems through an “admin control panel” while maintaining security and control. </p>\n<p>To prove how easy it is to use AgentKit, Christina Huang, an OpenAI engineer, built an entire AI workflow and two AI agents live onstage in under eight minutes.  </p>\n<p>“This is all the stuff that we wished we had when we were trying to build our first agents,” Altman said, noting that OpenAI has already signed on several launch partners that have already scaled agents using AgentKit. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Oracle has fixed a zero-day vulnerability in one of its flagship business software products that a hacking group is currently abusing to steal personal information about corporate executives. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/security/post/apply-july-2025-cpu\" target=\"_blank\">a brief post</a> updated over the weekend, Oracle chief security officer Rob Duhart said the tech giant released a new patch to fix a vulnerability in its Oracle E-Business suite, and urged customers to install the update as soon as possible.  </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html\" target=\"_blank\">security advisory</a> said the bug, tracked officially as CVE-2025-61882, can be “exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.” The advisory provided several so-called indicators of compromise to help Oracle customers identify evidence of hackers on their systems, suggesting that hackers are currently exploiting the vulnerability to steal customers’ sensitive data. </p>\n<p>Oracle <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/applications/ebusiness/\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> thousands of organizations around the world use its E-Business Suite to run their companies, including storing their customer data and their employees’ human resources files. </p>\n<p>The bug is known as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\" target=\"_blank\">zero-day</a> because Oracle, in this case, was given no time to patch the bug before it was maliciously exploited. </p>\n<p>Duhart’s updated post is an about-face from earlier this week, when a previous version of his post said Oracle was aware that some executives “have received extortion emails” linked to previously identified vulnerabilities patched in July, suggesting the extortion campaign was over. The newly identified zero-day bug suggests the hackers continued to exploit flaws in Oracle’s E-Business software that were unknown to Oracle at the time. </p>\n<p>News of the extortion attempts targeting corporate executives first emerged last week.  </p>\n<p>On October 2, Google security researchers said they found the prolific hacking group called Clop, which has been linked to numerous <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers/\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware attacks</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/the-accellion-data-breach-continues-to-get-messier/\" target=\"_blank\">extortion attempts</a> in recent years, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/hackers-are-sending-extortion-emails-to-executives-after-claiming-oracle-apps-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\">sending emails to </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/hackers-are-sending-extortion-emails-to-executives-after-claiming-oracle-apps-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/hackers-are-sending-extortion-emails-to-executives-after-claiming-oracle-apps-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\"> executives</a> around September 29 demanding money to not publish their personal information online. </p>\n<p>Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer of Google’s incident response unit Mandiant, said in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7380595612443893760/\" target=\"_blank\">post published Sunday on LinkedIn</a> that the vulnerabilities in Oracle’s E-Business software were being used in a “mass exploitation” campaign for data theft and extortion.  </p>\n<p>Much of the exploitation happened during August, said Carmakal, after the July patches were released. </p>\n<p>“Clop has been sending extortion emails to several victims since last Monday,” said Carmakal, but noted that the hackers haven’t reached out to all victims yet. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Healthcare is awash in single-use plastics. In U.S. healthcare facilities alone, <a href=\"https://www.hprc.org/resources/hospital-waste-characterization/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 2,800 tons</a> of plastic packaging and products are thrown out every day. </p>\n<p>Few people are more aware of this than Eddie Yu. Early in the pandemic, Yu founded a company that made disposable masks. One day, his niece was with him while he was sorting recycling, and she asked him whether his mask was also recyclable.</p>\n<p>“I told her that actually we can’t recycle the mask,” he told TechCrunch. “She just interrupted me and said, ‘Oh, then you make a lot of trash every day.’”</p>\n<p>The little girl’s words stuck with Yu, and after selling the mask company in 2021, he set out to make amends.</p>\n<p>In an effort to tame healthcare’s single-use plastic problem, Yu’s new company, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/okosix/\" target=\"_blank\">Ökosix</a>, has developed a new bio-based, biodegradable polymer.

The result is cheaper than polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable plastic, with functionality that is “the same or even better than PLA,” Yu said.</p>\n<p>Among plastics, the term “biodegradability” is often misused, Yu said. Some require very specific conditions to decompose, while others simply fall apart into micro- or nanoplastics. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We’ve got international certifications to prove that the material is completely gone in six months,” Yu said. </p>\n<p>Ökosix is starting with face masks, but it plans to also make surgical gowns, diapers, and sanitary napkins, Yu said. “We want to use a safe material, non-plastic, to replace fossil plastics for disposable products.”</p>\n<p>Though the company has yet to perform a formal life cycle analysis, Yu said that Ökosix’s material should have a carbon footprint that’s 90% lower than that of polypropylene, a widely used single-use plastic.</p>\n<p>Ökosix sells its material to third parties, which then turn it into various products. “At the moment, our business model is like Gore-Tex,” Yu said. “We don’t make the finished products, but we make the layer, we make the raw materials, and then we work with companies like 3M.” He added that branding could become a significant part of the business, similar to Gore-Tex.</p>\n<p>The startup has raised $2.3 million, including investments from the founders and other angel investors.</p>\n<p><em>Hear more from Ökosix and dozens of other startups firsthand, participate in valuable workshops, and make lasting connections at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">this year’s Disrupt</a>, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

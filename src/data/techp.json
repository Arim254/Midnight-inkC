The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan. </p>\n<p>“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a Senior Product Manager at Google Labs, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”</p>\n<p>Opal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal. </p>\n<p>The tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork. </p>\n<p>Google also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.</p>\n<p>With the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Hackers working for the North Korean government have stolen more than $2 billion in crypto so far this year, <a href=\"https://www.elliptic.co/blog/north-korea-linked-hackers-have-already-stolen-over-2-billion-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic</a>. </p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Elliptic <a href=\"http://elliptic.co/blog/north-korea-linked-hackers-have-already-stolen-over-2-billion-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">published a blog post</a> with this new estimate, which the company says is the “largest annual total on record, with three months still to go,” and is based on more than 30 hacks this year. </p>\n<p>The previous record was in 2022, when North Korea stole $1.35 billion. The regime’s total amount of stolen crypto since 2017 is at least $6 billion, according to Elliptic, which said that figure may still be an underestimate.  </p>\n<p>“The actual figure may be even higher. Attributing cyber thefts to North Korea is not an exact science,” reads the blog post.  </p>\n<p>“We are aware of many other thefts that share some of the hallmarks of North Korea-linked activity but lack sufficient evidence to be definitively attributed. Other thefts are likely unreported and remain unknown,” said Elliptic. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1200,627 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1280,669 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=720,376 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=900,471 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=800,418 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=2048,1071 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=668,349 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1180,617 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=708,370 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=50,26 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Elliptic</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The company said that North Korea’s main targets are still crypto exchanges, but the regime’s hackers are also starting to target “high-net-worth individuals,” who own large amounts of crypto.  </p>\n<p>And that’s not the only recent change, the company said.  </p>\n<p>“The majority of the hacks in 2025 have been perpetrated through social engineering attacks, where hackers deceive or manipulate individuals in order to gain access to cryptocurrency,” read the blog post. “This marks a shift from earlier attacks where in many cases technical flaws in crypto infrastructure were exploited to steal funds. This shift highlights that the weak point in cryptocurrency security is increasingly human, rather than technical.” </p>\n<p>Elliptic’s estimate seems to be in line with that of other organizations.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><br />Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang isn’t satisfied with the company being viewed, and used, as just a meeting notetaker. Liang wants Otter.ai to become a go-to source for enterprises and a new batch of products released Tuesday is the first step in that evolution. </p>\n<p>The Silicon Valley-based AI meeting assistant startup on Tuesday released a new suite of tools for enterprises designed to better incorporate data from meetings into other workflows by funneling that information to a central knowledge base. The aim is to grow Otter’s business by helping companies get more out of the meetings they record.</p>\n<p>Otter’s new product suite includes an API that allows users to build custom integrations with platforms like Jira and HubSpot, an MCP server — which connects users’ Otter data to external AI models — and a new AI agent that can search a company’s meetings notes or presentations.  </p>\n<p>Liang told TechCrunch it is the next phase of Otter’s life.  </p>\n<p>“We are evolving from a meeting notetaker to a corporate meeting knowledge base,” Liang said. “This is a system record for conversations. It can help corporations scale their growth and drive measurable business value.” </p>\n<p>When Otter was founded in 2016, there were just a handful of meeting transcription companies — a far leap from today. The AI boom that kicked off in 2022 fueled a surge in startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Granola</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/yc-backed-circleback-is-out-to-become-the-best-meeting-notetaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Circleback</a>. Even older players like Fireflies have seen a <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai/blog/fireflies-1-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">surge in interest</a>.  </p>\n<p>Liang argues this transition puts Otter into a separate division than its former peers.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meetings are where the majority of company knowledge is stored, in Liang’s opinion, whether that is notes from a customer sales call or discussions around a marketing strategy. But without a centralized place for these meeting notes, that information can only help a company so much.  </p>\n<p>“A lot of times, inefficiency happens because of information silos,” Liang said. “One team doesn’t know what the other team is doing, and it thinks that that was planned like a month ago. Oftentimes the plan changes, but not everybody is informed. So, the idea is to create a permission system so that you know most of the [nonconfidential] information is shared as broadly as possible.” </p>\n<p>Not every meeting with Otter will be directly added to this company-wide knowledge base and users can choose to restrict meeting note access for recordings that deal with sensitive information.  </p>\n<p>Employee and information privacy remains a concern despite access controls. Even if a meeting is around a neutral topic, Otter transcriptions pick the small talk and chatter that happens before and after meetings, which could contain gossip or information meant for only certain participants to hear.  </p>\n<p>Otter is also the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/g-s1-83087/otter-ai-transcription-class-action-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">August class-action lawsuit</a> that claims the company was recording private conversations without user consent and using that information to train its transcription services. </p>\n<p>Liang said that while he can’t comment on the lawsuit specifically, this isn’t an issue specific to Otter, and that when looking at the bigger picture, more access to information is better than not.  </p>\n<p>“If they accuse us, then they could accuse everyone else, all the tools you heard about doing meeting notes,” Liang said. “My view is that we are on the right side of history. We’re building this new AI revolution. If you want AI to help, you need to put AI in the meetings.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/06/no-more-loud-commercials-governor-newsom-signs-sb-576/\" target=\"_blank\">signed the law</a> on Monday.</p>\n<p>Starting July 1, 2026, streaming services won’t be allowed to “transmit the audio of commercial advertisements louder than the video content the advertisements accompany,” according to the bill’s text.</p>\n<p>“We heard Californians loud and clear, and what’s clear is that they don’t want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,” Governor Newsom said in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/06/no-more-loud-commercials-governor-newsom-signs-sb-576/\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. “By signing SB 576, California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms, which had previously not been subject to commercial volume regulations passed by Congress in 2010.”</p>\n<p>The legislation is modeled after the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which in 2010 barred the audio of TV commercials from being broadcast louder than the TV program being aired. With this new legislation, streaming services must comply with the same commercial volume regulations as traditional TV broadcasters in California.</p>\n<p>Senate Bill 576 was authored by California State Senator Tom Umberg, who cited a complaint from his legislative director, Zach Keller, about how the loud volume of streaming commercials was waking Keller’s newborn daughter, Samantha.</p>\n<p>“This bill was inspired by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who’s finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work,” said Senator Thomas Umberg in the press release. “SB 576 brings some much-needed peace and quiet to California households by making sure streaming ads aren’t louder than the shows we actually want to watch.”</p>\n<p>Given California’s influence in the entertainment world, this legislation could pressure streaming platforms into cutting down on noisy commercials nationwide. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI held <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS1YqcewH0c\" target=\"_blank\">its annual dev day on Monday</a>, where the company rolled out its plan to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">build apps into ChatGPT</a>. The demo was impressive, showing how programs like Spotify and Figma can be called or discovered without leaving the ChatGPT window. With so much of the tech world barreling toward AI integration, OpenAI’s demo was the best picture yet of what an AI-first internet might actually look like, with interfaces like ChatGPT querying information and executing commands directly.</p>\n<p>If you’re watching closely, you may have noticed that there’s a lot of room in this system for money to change hands. Just last week, the company launched Instant Checkout, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">an agentic shopping system</a> that serves as payment infrastructure for one-off purchases, plugging in any stores that sell through Shopify, Etsy, or Stripe. Now, apps provide the front-end infrastructure, letting service providers build their own interface into ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>In short, OpenAI now has all the pieces in place for AI-driven commerce, establishing ChatGPT as a place customers go to buy and retailers go to sell. It’s a huge new line of business for the company — and one with huge implications for the tech industry. In this world, OpenAI isn’t just competing with Google and Anthropic, but with Amazon and Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p>If you look at OpenAI’s pending app partners <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\">in the launch announcement</a>, you can see how far the vision reaches. ChatGPT will be able to call you a cab through Uber, book a trip on Expedia, call a plumber or locksmith through Thumbtack, and order groceries from Instacart, prepared food from DoorDash, or big-box goods from Target. Without too much more work, ChatGPT could become a portal for most of its users’ discretionary spending.</p>\n<p>If it works, this would be worth a lot more than just a $20-a-month subscription. The precise terms of the arrangement are still unclear, but like any app store, OpenAI is well-positioned to get a portion of any money spent on its platform. ChatGPT is also recommending products, drawing on its wealth of data about its users, which tips the balance of power between OpenAI and retailers even more. In <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Thompson’s terms</a>, ChatGPT becomes a super-aggregator, funneling customers to retailers and providing an entry point for ever-larger amounts of commerce. OpenAI has lots of potential lines of business to pursue, but it’s no exaggeration to say that AI-driven commerce is one of the most lucrative options.</p>\n<p>OpenAI isn’t the only company with an eye on this prospect. On the same day as the ChatGPT announcement, Adobe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/adobe-predicts-ai-assisted-online-shopping-to-grow-520-during-the-2025-u-s-holiday-season/\">released a report</a> predicting that this year’s holiday would be dominated by AI-assisted shopping, with shoppers turning to chatbots instead of search engines to find the best deals available. <a href=\"https://view.ceros.com/mastercard-labs/mastercard-agentic-commerce-q3/p/4\" target=\"_blank\">A separate report from Mastercard</a> dubbed agentic commerce as a “new competitive arena” for finance. Google has already launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/google-launches-new-protocol-for-agent-driven-purchases/\">its own competing protocol for agentic commerce</a> called AP2, which arrives with a broader scope but less momentum than OpenAI’s version.</p>\n<p>The simplest version of AI-driven shopping is using ChatGPT to find products in place of search: If you’re looking for a canvas tennis shoe under $80, ChatGPT can find it for you just as easily as Google Search. But AI systems don’t need to be passive. The AP2 specification includes a provision for agent-initiated purchases, if you want an agent to buy concert tickets as soon as they become available, say, or book a flight as soon as it falls below a certain price. Of course, there could be agents on the other side of the transaction too, negotiating with purchasing agents for the best deal, and willing to bundle goods under the right circumstances. If retailers and customers are willing to take the leap, the changes could extend pretty far beyond a simple “buy” button.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The biggest unanswered question is whether the shopping public will actually be interested.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Indian government’s tax authority has fixed a security flaw in its income tax filing portal that was exposing sensitive taxpayers’ data, TechCrunch has exclusively learned and confirmed with authorities.</p>\n<p>The flaw, discovered in September by a pair of security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral,” allowed anyone who was logged into the <a href=\"https://www.incometax.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\">income tax department’s e-Filing portal</a> to access up-to-date personal and financial data of other people.</p>\n<p>The exposed data included full names, home addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and bank account details of people who pay taxes on their income in India. The data also exposed citizens’ Aadhaar number, a unique government-issued identifier used as proof of identity and for accessing government services.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch verified the data to the best of its ability by granting permission to the researchers to look up this reporter’s records on the portal.</p>\n<p>The security researchers confirmed to TechCrunch on October 2 that the vulnerability was fixed. Given the risk to the public, TechCrunch withheld publishing this story until the security researchers confirmed that the vulnerability can no longer be exploited.</p>\n<p>Representatives for the Indian Income Tax Department acknowledged our email requesting comment, but did not answer our questions by press time. The Income Tax Department did not present any objections to our publishing this story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-extremely-low-hanging-bug-granted-access-to-sensitive-data\">‘Extremely low-hanging’ bug granted access to sensitive data</h2>\n<p>The security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral” told TechCrunch that they discovered the vulnerability while filing their recent income tax return on the government website.</p>\n<p>Residents of India are required to file their annual earnings to calculate the taxes they owe to the Indian government.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that when they signed into the portal using their Permanent Account Number (PAN), an official document issued by the Indian income tax department, they could view anyone else’s sensitive financial data by swapping out their PAN for another PAN in the network request as the web page loads.</p>\n<p>This could be done using publicly available tools like Postman or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">Burp Suite</a> (or using the web browser’s in-built developer tools) and with knowledge of someone else’s PAN, the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The bug was exploitable by anyone who was logged-in to the tax portal because the Indian income tax department’s back-end servers were not properly checking who was allowed to access a person’s sensitive data. This class of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common and simple flaw that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\" target=\"_blank\">governments have warned is easy to exploit</a> and can result in large-scale data breaches.</p>\n<p>“This is an extremely low-hanging thing, but one that has a very severe consequence,” the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to the data of individuals, the researchers said that the bug also exposed data associated with companies who were registered with the e-Filing portal.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch also verified that the bug exposed data on individuals who have yet to file their income tax returns this year. We confirmed this by asking a person who had not yet filed their tax returns for their permission to have the researchers look up their information using the portal bug.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-cert-in-acknowledges-security-flaw\">CERT-In acknowledges security flaw</h2>\n<p>The security researchers alerted India’s computer emergency readiness team, or CERT-In, to the security flaw soon after their discovery, but were not provided with a timeline for the fix.</p>\n<p>When contacted by TechCrunch on September 30, a CERT-In representative said the Income Tax Department was already working to fix the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The Indian Ministry of Finance did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment. After reaching out to the Income Tax Department regarding the vulnerability, the director general of Systems acknowledged receipt of TechCrunch’s email on October 1, but did not comment further.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear how long the vulnerability has existed or whether any malicious actors have accessed the exposed data. CERT-In did not respond to these questions when asked by TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The exact number of users impacted by the exposed data is also unclear. The Income Tax Department’s portal lists more than 135 million registered users, and over 76 million users filed income tax returns in the financial year 2024-25, per <a href=\"https://eportal.incometax.gov.in/iec/foservices/#/pre-login/success-enablers\" target=\"_blank\">public data</a> available on the portal itself.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Already, the startup has plans to bring its storefront to markets including Australia, Brazil, and Japan this year.

While the startup offers its own third-party apps, led by video game emulator <a href=\"https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta\" target=\"_blank\">Delta</a>, it began adding other third-party apps in June 2024. This included the virtual machine app UTM, a move that pressured Apple to open its own App Store to allow virtual machines.</p>\n<p>AltStore also partnered with Epic Games in August of last year to bring Fortnite and other mobile games to its EU storefront, AltStore PAL. The company also entered the adult app market this year with the decision to host an app called Hot Tub, which was the first iOS app for pornography and is now its top app.</p>\n<p>In April, AltStore began allowing developers to self-publish their apps for free on AltStore PAL, prompting further growth. </p>\n<p>AltStore’s founders told TechCrunch that the store now has over 100 developers on board, which is more than Epic Games offers on its alternative games store, for comparison. AltStore, which is not limited to games, attracts a variety of developers, including indies who want to put out apps more as well as those who wouldn’t meet Apple’s stricter requirements, like its adult content restrictions.</p>\n<p>Plus, developers like that the store supports different types of business models, whether that’s a more traditional subscription or something where users donate toward the app’s development, for instance.</p>\n<p>“We have hundreds of thousands of users,” AltStore co-founder Testut told TechCrunch in an interview. “Wonderful and good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Now, alongside the additional funding, AltStore is launching its <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/n5KGCN7r8rsMQ7Z8CmfrtysOPW?domain=explore.alt.store\" target=\"_blank\">own Mastodon server,</a> running on the ActivityPub protocol, where users will be able to view app updates and new information from the sources they follow. Developers can opt in to have their app updates published to the new server.</p>\n<p>“That means, if you have a Mastodon account or a Threads account, you could follow these accounts. You could follow the source from our Mastodon server. Then, in your timeline, you’d see when there was an app update,” explains Testut.</p>\n<p>Once opted in, these updates will be automated by way of a JSON file with metadata. And this will output whatever is in the AltStore to the fediverse. </p>\n<p>“It’s adding a social layer,” said Testut. “People can reply to apps from their Mastodon account. They can like stuff from their Threads account.” (Plus, the plan is to bridge the service with the open social ecosystem on Bluesky, using tools from the nonprofit, A New Social.)</p>\n<p>The service will also help with discoverability, as users can look to the server and the accounts it hosts to find apps they may want to try.  </p>\n<p>With the additional funds, AltStore wants to give back to the ecosystem that will make its social network possible. </p>\n<p>To that end, it’s giving back $500,000 to various projects in the fediverse. So far, it’s donated to Mastodon gGmbH ($300,000), as well as Bridgy Fed by A New Social, Ivory + Phoenix by Tapbots, Tapestry by The Iconfactory, mstdn.social, Akkoma, PeerTube, BookWyrm, and Fedify.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy is looking to cut billions more in federal funding, and many promising startups as well as automakers Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis could be affected by the Trump administration’s decision.</p>\n<p>The proposed cuts would cancel more than $500 million of contracts awarded to more than a dozen startups, according to a TechCrunch analysis of a internal document that has not become public yet. All of the proposed cuts are grants that had been awarded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The proposed cancelations, many of which have not been reported before, come on top of more than $7.5 billion in contracts the Trump administration said it would cut last week. </p>\n<p>Startups might not be the only losers. Other companies slated to lose grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars include Daimler Trucks North America, Ford, General Motors, Harley-Davidson, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Stellantis, and Volvo Technology of America, according to the document viewed by TechCrunch. Sources confirmed with TechCrunch these are proposed cuts. </p>\n<p>General Motors could lose at least <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-investments-gms-lansing-grand-river-assembly-underscore\">$500 million in grant money</a> issued from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. The money was going to be used to retool the Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. The automaker announced in July 2024 it planned to produce electrified vehicles, including hybrids at the plant. </p>\n<p>Some of the awards are significant and, if cut, will undoubtedly affect the startups’ operations. Several were included in a list of proposed cuts that leaked last week, but many are new and have yet to be announced. TechCrunch has reached out to several of the companies and will update this article if they reply.</p>\n<p>Two awards on the chopping block topped $100 million, including a $189 million award granted to materials startup Brimstone. Those funds would have helped the company build a plant to produce Portland cement, alumina, and other materials using less carbon dioxide. </p>\n<p>The other went to Anovion, a Chicago-based startup that is working to build a factory to produce a domestic supply of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries. Currently, Chinese companies dominate the graphite market.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Battery materials startup Li Industries received $55.2 million under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to recycle LFP batteries in an attempt to wrest part of that supply chain from China.</p>\n<p>Other cement startups are on the list, too. Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime Systems was given an award for $86.9 million to build an ultra-low-carbon cement plant. Mountain View-based Furno, which is making a novel, modular cement kiln, would lose its $20 million grant to build a demonstration in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Several building materials companies were also on the list. CleanFiber and Hempitecture, which make insulation for homes and commercial buildings, are at risk of losing $10 million and $8.4 million each. Skyven Technologies, which makes industrial heat pumps, and Luxwall, which makes super-insulated windows, would lose $15 million and $31 million respectively. </p>\n<p>At least one of the proposed cancelations seemingly cuts against the administration’s goals of energy and AI dominance. TS Conductor, which could lose $28.2 million in grant money, makes advanced conductors for electric lines that promise to double or triple capacity on existing transmission lines.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After AMD and OpenAI announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded partnership on Monday</a>, the <a href=\"https://x.com/litcapital/status/1975402366611378538\" target=\"_blank\">chatter</a> immediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. </p>\n<p>To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. </p>\n<p>But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 million apiece, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm\">AMD disclosed</a>. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement.  </p>\n<p>If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about a $100 billion.  </p>\n<p>“We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases.  </p>\n<p>Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and intuitional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. </p>\n<p>In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investment <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">announced last month</a>. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. </p>\n<p>But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% marketshare, USB estimates — into one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">biggest build-outs</a> of next-generation data centers the world has ever seen.  </p>\n<p>While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.” </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tesla has spent more than a year teasing that “more affordable models” of its vehicles were on the way, and on Tuesday, the company finally revealed them. The company is now selling a more bare-bones version of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively.</p>\n<p>The new versions, each dubbed “Standard,” get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. They don’t even have Autopilot, the company’s basic advanced driver assistance system. (The new models only come with traffic-aware cruise control; Autosteer, which completes the “Autopilot” feature-set, is missing.)</p>\n<p>The release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla — before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/teslas-25000-ev-flip-flop-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">he ultimately killed that project</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Model 3 does not even dip below the $35,000 price threshold that Tesla promoted in a run-up to the car’s launch in 2016. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option.</p>\n<p>The new cars are more different on the inside than the outside. While Tesla’s cars are known for being minimalist, the Model 3 and Model Y Standard take the spartan approach to the limit. There’s no second-row touchscreen. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There’s no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Only the first row has heated seats.</p>\n<p>On the outside, Tesla ditched the light bar that adorns the nose of the more expensive Model Y variants. The glass roof is also gone on the Standard cars. </p>\n<p>Musk and other Tesla executives have <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-quotes-cybertruck-optimus-banks-debt-real-estate-2023-10\" target=\"_blank\">joked</a> in the past, and at length, about playing “Game of Thrones but [for] pennies” — an effort to describe the company’s mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That strip-it-down thinking appears to be the primary strategy of how the company approached the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Tesla plans to sell these versions in multiple global markets, including in Europe. The expiration of the U.S. federal EV tax credit last month means these prices will be pretty straightforward in the United States, unless buyers live somewhere with strong state EV incentives.</p>\n<p>That sets up an interesting calculus for new-EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla. </p>\n<p>Ford is working on a low-cost electric vehicle platform due out in 2027. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt. Upstart automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, and even newer entrants like Slate Auto, are pushing to release EVs in the next few years that are priced on either side of the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.</p>\n<p>Musk did tangible damage to Tesla’s brand earlier this year when he got involved in the second Trump administration. Tesla rebounded to notch its best quarter ever as the EV tax credit expired and it is unclear how durable that momentum will be. The new Standard models will likely apply competitive pressure on Tesla’s own offerings, not to mention the potential havoc it could wreak on the used market.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Äio (pronounced EYE-oh) is the Estonian god of dreams. It seems a sweetly appropriate namesake for a rising startup, called ÄIO, from that tiny Baltic country that has developed a process to turn agricultural waste like sawdust into fats for the food and cosmetic industries. </p>\n<p>This process could be a way to reduce the world’s dependency on palm oil, which has become a staple for food and cosmetics for its emulsifying and preservative properties. Unfortunately, because of that plant’s need for hot humid climates, this massive industry has also notoriously destroyed rain forests and other sensitive ecosystems to make way for farms.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/aio/\">ÄIO</a> was co-founded by biotechnology scientists Nemailla Bonturi and Petri-Jaan Lahtvee based on Bonturi’s doctoral research. During her studies she invented a new microbe, a strain of yeast. Instead of consuming sugar and outputting carbon dioxide gas or alcohol as with bread and beer, this yeast consumes sugar and outputs fat molecules. The company will show off its tech as part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a> at this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, which runs later this month in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Lahtvee was a professor of Food Tech and Bioengineering at Estonia’s Tallinn University of Technology and, in 2016, running his own biotech lab there with Bonturi, his first hire. She brought her microbe with her, and they worked on the molecule, altering it to be hardy enough to be manufactured.</p>\n<p>As Estonia has a large agriculture base of corn and other food grains, as well as sugarcane and lumber, the lab studied how sugars produced from those ag waste streams could feed this microbe. “We started working on it, developing metabolic engineering tools,” Lahtvee told TechCrunch. The answer: It could consume those sugars quite well.</p>\n<p>The molecule’s “fat profile is very similar to existing fats,” Lahtvee says, and, in its solid-fat form, probably “most closely resembles chicken fat.” But it is also  possible to modify the fermentation process to produce a liquid oil as well that could make it a good alternative to manufactured oils like canola/rapeseed oil.</p>\n<p>In 2022, the founders knew they had a commercially viable solution and launched ÄIO with the hope of raising venture money and establishing commercial partnerships to bring it to market. They’ve raised about $7 million so far and, since founding, have created methods for developing precision fermentation products, won the 2024 Baltic Sustainability Award, and signed over 100 companies worldwide interested in collaboration, the startup says.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We have a very extensive analysis after we make our product and, so far, what we have seen is that our final product is to the same level as vegetable oils, except for the pesticides — even more pure,” Bonturi told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Next up, the company plans to build a facility to produce the fat in commercial quantities by 2027, as well as license the technology to other cosmetic and food manufacturers. It also must obtain licenses to sell the fats as food, country by country, most likely starting with Singapore, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/04/even-after-1-6b-in-vc-money-the-lab-grown-meat-industry-is-facing-massive-issues/\" target=\"_blank\">has a history of being more open</a> to alternative food production products.</p>\n<p>“Of course, it’s a novel type of way of producing food, and we have to go through all the permits and analysis,” Bonturi said.</p>\n<p>As such plans progress, Bonturi said that she hopes to show how “two scientists in this small country could actually do something better for the world, but that’s just my personal dream.”</p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn more about ÄIO from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco. </em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Learn more here.</em></a><em> </em> </p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "\nFood waste startup Mill said Tuesday that it has inked a deal with Amazon to deploy its bins in Whole Foods produce departments across the country starting in 2027. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund is also investing in the startup, though it did not disclose the amount. The company has raised a total of $250 million to date, according to an Axios report.\nFood waste is a big problem. About 10% of all food — 43 billion pounds, according to one 2014 study — is tossed every year at U.S. grocery stores. For an industry that operates on thin margins, every pound thrown out is a missed opportunity and adds to a store’s carbon footprint. \nMill is hoping that its sensor-laden bins can gather enough data to help Whole Foods reduce the amount of produce it throws out. After the bins have dehydrated and ground the food waste, the waste will be turned into chicken feed that’ll be shipped to Whole Foods’ private label egg suppliers.\n"

A key issue, apparently, was IPO timing. Anil pushed for an earlier listing than some directors wanted and signaled he might leave soon after, while board members sought more time to expand internationally and grow the company’s valuation. (Monzo was reportedly valued at $5.9 billion in an October 2024 secondary share sale backed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and StepStone Group.)\nTechCrunch sat down with Anil in person this summer, and we discussed the possibility of Monzo going public in 2026, a timeline that now appears to have been at the center of boardroom disagreements.\n\n\n\nUnder Anil’s leadership since 2020, Monzo reportedly tripled its customer base to 13 million and posted record £60.5 million pre-tax profits. But nearly all customers remain UK-based after the company’s U.S. expansion stalled in 2021. We talked with Anil about this, too, during our sit-down.\nNow Layfield, who spent nine years at Google and more than a decade at Standard Chartered (of which Anil is also an alum), will oversee Monzo’s international strategy and guide it toward its eventual public listing.\nWe’ve reached out to Monzo for more information.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Fintech\n"

The company on Monday said the Apple TV app for Android will now support Google Cast functionality, which lets users stream videos and audio directly to their TV.\nThe tech giant’s adoption of Google Cast signals its interest in making Apple TV a more competitive streaming service at a time when the market is seeing increased consolidation. Netflix and Paramount are fighting to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney is preparing to merge Hulu into its own streaming app.\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe feature is arriving just after Netflix quietly abandoned support for Google Cast in its own app, angering many subscribers. Apple’s support for the feature could potentially attract Android users upset by Netflix’s decision who choose to move their streaming dollars elsewhere.\nApple TV’s lineup of original content is smaller than what other streaming services offer, but it still features a number of popular shows and films like “Severance,” “Pluribus,” “The Studio,” “The Morning Show,” “Slow Horses,” and the recent summer blockbuster, “F1.” For sports, Apple TV offers livestreamed “Friday Night Baseball” doubleheaders, plus Major League Soccer matches, and Formula 1 races in the U.S.\nTo cast to their TV, users will need to install the Apple TV app from Google Play, which works on smartphones, tablets, and foldables.

Google today launched one such experimental email-based assistant called CC through a Google Labs experiment.\nCC, which is powered by Gemini, can connect with your account, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and provide you with a daily brief via email. This “Your Day Ahead” email makes users aware of their tasks, summarizes their calendar, and provides key updates for the day from these accounts.\nYou can also reply to or email CC at any time with requests such as adding to-dos, teaching it to your preferences, remembering notes, or searching for information. \nAt the moment, CC is available to AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S. and Canada who are 18 or above. The company said that the assistant is only available to consumer Google accounts at the moment and not Workspace accounts.\nThere are several examples of AI-powered email-based briefs and assistants. Sequoia-backed Mindy, which now works in the creator and marketing space, started as an email assistant. Other meeting notetakers like Read AI and Fireflies also send users a daily brief, but they might not have context from email and Drive.

The e-commerce giant earlier this month also unveiled the latest iteration in its Trainium series of chips, and outlined the development of the next installment of those chips, complementing its cloud computing offerings via Amazon Web Services.\nNews of the deal comes a couple months after OpenAI completed its transition to a for-profit model, which gives it more freedom to strike deals with investors other than Microsoft, one of the company’s earliest backers with a stake of 27%.\nAmazon investing in OpenAI would mark the latest in a series of circular deals in the AI space — major hardware manufacturers and cloud providers strike deals with young AI companies to use their products, while the upstarts commit to using their data centers and chips for training their AI models. \nThis past March, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy chips from its backer Nvidia. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. Then in October, OpenAI signed a deal to pick up a 10% stake in AMD and committed to using the chipmaker’s AI GPUs, and also signed a chip usage agreement with Broadcom that month. And in November, the ChatGPT maker signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon.\nOpenAI and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

In some cases, consumers were paying as much as 23% more than other shoppers for the exact same product, the report says.\nThe software involved in the experiments, Eversight, is a SaaS product that offers grocers a retail pricing suite designed to “unlock revenue growth” and capitalize on “pricing solutions that scale your pricing strategy and uncover optimal prices your customers expect.” Instacart discloses on its Eversight page that some shoppers “may see slightly higher prices” than others.\nHowever, as previously noted, some of those price hikes seem slightly higher than “slightly higher.” A 23% price hike isn’t exactly chump change.\nWhen reached for comment, Instacart referred TechCrunch to a previously released statement in which the company noted that “just as retailers have long tested prices in physical stores to understand what resonates with customers, a small subset of our retail partners – 10 U.S. retail partners that already choose to apply markups – use Instacart’s Eversight technology to run limited online pricing tests.” The company also took issue with its activity being referred to as “dynamic pricing,” calling it instead an “AI-enabled pricing experiment.” An Instacart spokesperson said: “These tests are not dynamic pricing – prices never change in real-time, including in response to supply and demand. The tests are never based on personal or behavioral characteristics — they are completely randomized.”\nDynamic pricing has become increasingly common in recent years, and many big e-commerce sites have been accused of employing it. Another recent report claimed that, due to dynamic pricing used by Amazon, school districts across the U.S. have been paying higher prices for basic school supplies. Amazon has since called the report “flawed and misleading.”\nThis story has been updated with an additional statement from Instacart. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n"

    "body": "\nNetflix and audio powerhouse iHeartMedia have entered into a new partnership to bring 14 video podcasts exclusively to Netflix in early 2026, the companies announced Tuesday. This represents Netflix’s second major step into the podcast space, following its recent collaboration with Spotify.\nThe new video podcast episodes will premiere on Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, with plans to expand to additional markets. \nAs part of the agreement, Netflix will get a diverse range of shows spanning comedy, crime, history, sports, and more, which feature notable names such as “Dear Chelsea” with Chelsea Handler, “The Breakfast Club” with Charlamagne, and “My Favorite Murder” with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. \nThe deal covers all new episodes from the podcast lineup, as well as select library episodes from each show. Meanwhile, iHeartMedia will retain the audio-only rights and distribution, ensuring podcasts remain available on iHeartRadio and other major podcast platforms.\nNetflix hopes that the millions of people who prefer the video version of these shows will flock to the streaming platform over competitors like YouTube. However, since these podcasters are no longer getting video versions of their shows on YouTube, they could lose out on ad revenue and reach, potentially alienating fans who are accustomed to watching there. \nThe deal follows Netflix’s announcement of a similar deal with Spotify for shows including “The Ringer,” “The Bill Simmons Podcast,” and “The Zach Lowe Show.”\nNetflix’s push into video podcasts is part of its mission to broaden its offerings beyond TV shows and movies. For instance, Netflix struck a deal with YouTube personalities Ms. Rachel and Mark Rober to appeal to a wider audience and tap into the growing creator economy. And Netflix recently launched party games on TV screens. \nMost notably, the streamer is looking to dive headfirst into the theater business as it seeks to acquire Warner Bros. \nHere are the shows included in the new partnership:\n\nThe Breakfast Club\nBobby Bones Presents: The Bobbycast\nMy Favorite Murder\nDear Chelsea\nJoe and Jada\nThis Is Important\nThe Psychology of Your 20s\nBehind the Bastards \nStuff They Don’t Want You to Know\nStuff You Missed in History Class\nStuff to Blow Your Mind\nNew Rory & MAL\n3 and Out with John Middlekauff\nBuried Bones \n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nElon Musk’s X is updating its Terms of Service to indicate it still lays claim to the “Twitter” trademark. The move to add this detail to the company’s terms follows an announcement from a Virginia-based startup, which recently filed an application to trademark the term “Twitter.”\nThe startup, Operation Bluebird, claims that X had abandoned the brand “Twitter” by renaming its social networking service “X.” In its petition to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filed on December 2, the startup pointed to a post from X owner Musk on July 23, 2023, which proclaimed that the social network would soon “bid adieu to the twitter brand.”\nX is now challenging that claim with a countersuit of its own. (A copy of the filing was shared with TechCrunch via IP trademark law firm Gerben IP; it’s not yet showing in PACER as of the time of publication.) In the filing, X says that it continues to exclusively own the Twitter and Tweet trademarks and the bluebird logo.\nSince filing its petition for cancellation, Operation Bluebird has been collecting potential user sign-ups for its own social network at a website named Twitter.new. The effort is headed up by two lawyers, including founder Michael Peroff, based in Illinois, and Stephen Coates, previously a trademark lawyer at Twitter. Given their backgrounds, their assertion that they plan to launch a new service to rival X seems dubious. It’s more likely they want to acquire the trademark, which has value of its own.\nNevertheless, X isn’t taking its chances. Its revised Terms of Service, effective as of January 15, 2026, states:\n\nNothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.\n\nPreviously, the terms only referenced X in this section. There was no mention of Twitter. \nThe terms additionally include other, more minor updates, including mentions related to EU laws and generated content. X’s Privacy Policy was also updated with a couple of references to age assurance technology. \nThis article was updated with a link to the countersuit following its initial publication.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nInstagram is expanding Reels-viewing beyond mobile, the social network announced on Tuesday. The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.\nBy bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don’t have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.\nIG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.\nReels will also play automatically, so you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch what’s next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nUsers have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. \nIt’s worth noting that IG for TV shouldn’t be confused with IGTV, which was Instagram’s app for watching long-form content before being shut down in 2022. \nThe launch of the TV app doesn’t come as a surprise, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in October that the company was planning a dedicated TV app. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re exploring TV,” Mosseri said at Bloomberg’s Screentime event. “TV is an increasingly important surface, it’s been very important for YouTube […] it’s been very important for TikTok. So we’d like to figure out how to make sure that we show up in a compelling way on all the relevant devices.”\nMosseri went on to note that it was a mistake for the company not to have explored a TV app earlier, and that he wishes they had done so a few years ago.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

So, yes, most of the movies on the WikiFlix homepage are your grandma’s age, but isn’t it kind of fun to imagine what Netflix would’ve been like back in the day?\nWikiFlix isn’t new, but it’s new to us, courtesy of a TikTok by Annie Rauwerda, the creator behind the “Depths of Wikipedia” accounts.\n\nWhile WikiFlix can introduce you to historic films like “Wings,” the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, there’s also a bunch of hidden gems on there. As Rauwerda says in her TikTok, “Sometimes I really like watching things that I know nobody else is watching, because what if I discover something crazy?” \nOn its homepage, WikiFlix prioritizes movies that have a lot of sitelinks on their Wikipedia pages, since those are more likely to be popular or interesting. But there is some degree of curation. The community around WikiFlix maintains a blacklist, which helps ensure that you’re not going to run into a historical Nazi propaganda film during your next “WikiFlix and chill” night. (“While these [films] are perfectly fine in an educational context, WikiFlix is more focused on entertainment,” a WikiFlix page says.)\nWikiFlix content may not exactly be as binge-worthy as “Stranger Things,” but give it a try. Why not watch a Soviet musical inspired by Cinderella, a silent film about swashbuckling pirates, or a Japanese post-apocalyptic film that features a guy who somehow played for both the Boston Celtics and the Chicago Cubs? You can always catch up on “Love Is Blind” another time.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nMarley Alles started out in accounting.  \nShe thought that her dream was to work at a big company. “And then once I got there, I was like ‘oh, that’s it?,” she told TechCrunch.  \nAlles began fostering other passions and found herself curious about the world of startups. She would listen to every podcast and read each book, taking notes on topics that interested her.  \nShe didn’t think much of it until one summer when so many of her friends got married that she found herself spending thousands of dollars on bridesmaid dresses and bachelorette looks. One day, someone approached her and asked to borrow one of her dresses. “I was like ‘yeah, for sure, take it,’” she recalled. “And then I thought, ‘how can this be done on a larger scale?’” \nAlles had all these expensive dresses just sitting in her closet. She didn’t want to sell them, but she knew she probably would never wear those gowns again. “That’s what led me, long story short, to create Rax,” she said.  \nAlles launched Rax earlier this year as a peer-to-peer clothing rental company. It functions right now as a marketplace (it does not own any clothing inventory), where users scroll through listings and connect with people who have clothing items they want to rent.  \nShe’s bootstrapped the company so far, enough to fully code the app and officially launch it. The first few customers were her friends and family, and the rest came by word of mouth. Alles said she leaned into the idea of “building in public,” where she posted online about her adventures creating this product in hopes of amassing an engaged audience of potential customers. She has about 5,000 users on the app right now.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRax is one of the first of its kind to be launched in Toronto. It’s like Rent-the-Runway, or the US’s Pickle, or Europe’s By Rotation. The idea of renting clothes — similar to buying secondhand — has been picking up steam as it is seen as a more environmentally sustainable way to consume fashion rather than buying new items for each new season.  \n“It’s driving the circularity of fashion,” Alles said.  \nBut what makes Rax different from many others is that she offers long-term rentals. “On our platform, you can rent up to six months,” she said. “On competitor platforms, it’s daily rentals. So it gets really expensive if you want to rent for a couple-week vacation. Or maybe you want a winter jacket for the season.”  \nAt TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Rax announced its first foray into the U.S. market. Alles said she had been a huge fan of TechCrunch and applied for the Battlefield competition, where she later won the top consumer pitch in the competition.  \nAlles said she was surprised to win. “There were so many companies that had like thousands or hundreds of thousands of users; raised [like] $20 million in my category, and one [had] the lead actors from [the show] Silicon Valley,” she said.  \nStill, she found the experience “awesome.” Alles went up to every startup booth to introduce herself to other founders, and also attended some sessions as well as partook in networking. Actually, that was one of the biggest lessons she said she’s learned as a founder — the importance of in-person interaction, because it helps her connect with the community better.  \nNow that Disrupt has passed, Alles said the company hopes to continue its expansion across New York and start building out a rental service platform to offer fashion designers and retailers looking to offer rental clothing to consumers.  \n“We have the technology, we have the audience,” she said, adding that brands are also looking at ways to become more sustainable, and companies like Rax let them do it. “I think things are getting better and people are becoming more aware of their impact.”  \nThis piece was updated to show that Pickle operates nationwide. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAn administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News. \n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” \n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech. \nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nSlate Auto, the electric truck startup backed by Jeff Bezos, has now collected more than 150,000 refundable reservations for its low-cost EV due out at the end of 2026.\nThe company shared the figure in a new Q&A video with CEO Chris Barman, where she answers questions from those reservation holders about the company’s plans for self-driving (there are none), or whether owners will be able to affix a car seat to the optional rear seats (they will).\nReservations are a somewhat helpful metric for gauging general interest in a new car, but they are by no means a signal of sure success. Time and again over the last few years, we have seen EV companies tout reservation figures only to go bust, either because they weren’t able to get through the difficult process of standing up production, or because they weren’t ready to have cars on the road.\nFor Slate, it’s promising that the number has continued to climb, meaning that new reservations are coming in faster than any attrition the company might be seeing. That said, Slate crossed the 100,000 reservation mark all the way back in May, right after it came out of stealth, so it took a good seven months to grow the list by 50%. And looking forward, Slate plans to make 150,000 of these EVs per year at the factory it’s refurbishing in Warsaw, Indiana, so it will need to attract far more buyers if it plans to succeed in the market.\n\nAny continued enthusiasm for Slate’s EV has to be a reassuring sign for the company, given the state of electric trucks overall these days. Just yesterday, Ford announced it is ending production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the first major battery-powered pickup truck to hit the U.S. market a few years ago. (It’s being replaced by a version with a gas generator attached.) The company said the Lightning simply wasn’t making enough money — a fact exacerbated by how Ford was never able to sell more than a few thousand per quarter. Sales of other electric trucks, like Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV, have also struggled to stay above that mark.\nOf course, the Lightning was a sort-of Frankenstein’s monster of a vehicle, with Ford shoehorning EV technology into a design that was originally meant for gas powertrains. Slate’s truck has been designed from the ground up to be an EV, and the company is hyper-focused on selling it for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range. The decline of offerings from Ford and others may help clear the way for Slate to find early success — that is, until Ford’s real shot at a low-cost EV hits the market in 2027.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nDoorDash is launching a new AI-powered social app that’s designed to help users quickly find local restaurants. The app, called Zesty, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.\nWith the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.\nOnce people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an Instagram promo post, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”\nDoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an X post that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.” \nImage Credits:Zesty\nThe app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others.\nUsers can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network. \n“At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNews of the app’s launch was first reported by Bloomberg.\nOf course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google. For people who have already embedded AI into their daily lives, they may already be using services like ChatGPT and Gemini to discover new restaurants. However, the app could be a welcome launch for people who want to be part of a social network that’s all about discovering new restaurants.\nThe launch of the new app marks DoorDash’s latest effort to branch beyond delivery services, as the company earlier this year launched features that allow customers to make reservations for in-person dining and earn in-store rewards. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMoEngage, a customer engagement platform used by consumer brands across 75 countries, has announced a $180 million Series F follow-on transaction just over a month after securing $100 million, with a majority of the latest funding providing liquidity to investors and employees through secondary transactions.\nIn the latest raise, about $123 million was secondary, including a $15 million employee tender that provided liquidity to 259 current and former employees, while the remaining $57 million was raised as primary capital and went into the business. The round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. Early backers, including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast, sold shares in the secondary transactions.\nThe deal valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, per a person close to the deal, who added that the startup was tracking toward $100 million in annualised recurring revenue this year. MoEngage did not disclose these figures.\nMoEngage plans to use the fresh capital to invest further in its Merlin AI suite and expand its use of AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams, said Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive, in an interview. The startup is also pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling its analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering, a move it expects to lift average contract values and expand its addressable market.\n“When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data,” Dodda said.\nMoEngage also plans to use part of its fresh capital raise to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, targeting software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate its expansion in those markets. It also targets small AI teams to bolster its intelligence-led offerings.\nThe 11-year-old startup, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, already gets more than 30% of its revenue from North America, about 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMoEngage’s secondary-heavy structure of the raise reflects its late-stage position, allowing early investors and employees to take liquidity without forcing the company into a near-term public listing. This approach gives MoEngage flexibility to choose its next steps based on business priorities rather than investor exit timelines.\n“It gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” Dodda said, adding that the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions and other factors.\nMoEngage expects to turn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) positive this quarter and is targeting compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years, Dodda said.\nBhavin Turakhia, co-founder and chief executive of fintech firm Zeta, a MoEngage customer, said the startup’s analytics and messaging tools have helped it improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys.\nThe secondary component of the round also enabled some early investors to exit fully. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, is one of them. The VC firm recorded a roughly 10-times return on its investment on a blended basis, its partner Vinay Rao told TechCrunch.\nRao said that while many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which he said has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business.\nWith the latest round, MoEngage has raised about $307 million in primary funding to date. Avendus advised MoEngage for the transaction.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

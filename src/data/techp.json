The two sides have spent months negotiating what the next version of the contract would look like, but those negotiations have been complicated by President Trump’s push to privatize the USPS, the Post reports.\nUnder the current agreement, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency’s revenue in 2025.\n“The USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement, adding that the company is discussing “ways to extend our partnership.” \nBut Kelly said Amazon was “surprised to hear” the USPS wants to “run an auction” for some of its shipping capacity. \n“[S]o we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we’re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers,” he said.\nAmazon already operates a large transportation network that includes airplanes, Rivian electric vans, and a budding drone delivery service — though the drone program has faced a number of struggles this year, including most recently, a Federal Aviation Administration probe.

The startup raised $160 million in the round.\nThis latest capital infusion came just months after it raised $300 million in a Series E round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation in February.\nHarvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey released some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams.\nAs an industry entirely based on words, it makes sense that legal functions would be a perfect use case for LLMs: searching, summarizing, and drafting, all based on domain-specific training. But Harvey is also one of the best examples of how VCs are “kingmaking” these days. That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nGiven that Harvey was founded in 2022, it may be far enough ahead of competitors — both in customer acquisition and the reinforced training from working with so many law firms — that it is the king of this market. At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so.\nGil told TechCrunch that Harvey is one of the AI market leaders that is experiencing bona fide growth because its tech and market position are “just working.”\nHarvey’s founder and CEO Winston Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos an incredible story of how it originally claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt all started with a proof of concept about landlord-tenant law and a cold email to Sam Altman. Harvey became one of OpenAI Startup Fund’s first investments. And it’s been a VC darling ever since.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nEvery year, Google releases a report highlighting the top trending searches, offering a snapshot of what captured our collective curiosity, spanning pop culture, entertainment, internet trends, and news events. This year, people around the world were most curious about everything from hot honey and AI chatbots to the Toronto Blue Jays.\nBefore we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that Google’s report doesn’t reflect the overall most popular searches. If it did, the list would be filled with general terms like “weather” rather than trending topics. Instead, Google’s “Year in Search” highlights queries that saw a sustained spike in traffic in 2025 compared with 2024.\nThat being said, the top trending search of the year was “Gemini,” which is Google’s AI chatbot, followed by “India vs England” and “Charlie Kirk.” Gemini wasn’t the only AI chatbot to make the list, as DeepSeek ranked seventh among the year’s trending searches.\nIn 2025, Google says Charlie Kirk was the top trending news topic, with the query “Charlie Kirk assassination” leading the list. The second and third trending news queries were “Iran” and “US Government Shutdown,” respectively.\nAs for recipes and food, the top spot went to the sweet-and-spicy condiment hot honey, while Marry Me Chicken and chimichurri rounded out the top three.\nFor movies, the top trending search was “Anora” followed by “Superman” and the “Minecraft Movie.” The top trending search for actors went to “Anora” star Mikey Madison. Lewis Pullman, who starred in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts,” took the second spot, followed by Isabela Merced, who was featured in “Superman.”\nIn terms of sports, “FIFA Club World Cup” was the top trending search, followed by “Asia Cup” and “ICC Champions Trophy.” The top searched sports team was Paris Saint-Germain F.C., while the second and third were S.L. Benfica and the Toronto Blue Jays, respectively. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs for podcasts, the top trending search was “The Charlie Kirk Show,” followed by Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” and “This Is Gavin Newsom.”\nFor books, the top trending search was for Colleen Hoover’s “Regretting You.” Rebecca Yarros’ “Onyx Storm,” and Navessa Allen’s “Lights Out” rounded out the top three.\nYou can check out the full report here. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "The European Commission is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta's move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp's business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users.",
    "body": "\nMeta’s decision to serve only its AI chatbot, Meta AI, to WhatsApp users isn’t sitting well with the competition regulators in Europe. The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.\nWhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.\nNotably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.\nIn its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”\n“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.\n“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. \n“This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.\nIf Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.\nWhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. \n“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Plus, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft provides weeks of battery life, Amazon notes.\nThe Kindle Scribe Colorsoft will be available on December 10 starting at $629.99.\nThe devices feature a new Home experience that lets users jot something down, and open recently opened and added books, documents, and notebooks. Amazon anticipates both devices being used for handwritten notes, and the devices include significant product integrations to enhance that experience.

    "body": "\nOn season one of Build Mode: Product, Meet Market, we explore what it really takes to get your product into the hands of customers. We’ve talked a lot about product-market fit, but this week we take a step back to something just as essential and far less discussed: founder-market fit. \nInvestors love to ask, “What’s your competitive advantage?” Usually they’re talking about moats, IP, and defensibility. But before you ever write a line of code, you already have assets: your background, your experiences, your reputation, your network. Most founders simply forget to treat those as strategic tools. \nAs the saying goes, “if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.” Be intentional about who you surround yourself with, build a focused network, and share your unique expertise boldly. \nThis week, Isabelle sits down with Kyle Rudolph and Jon Walburg, co-founders of Alltroo, a fundraising platform that transforms celebrity access into once-in-a-lifetime charitable sweepstakes, from swimming with Michael Phelps to Oktoberfest at Arnold Schwarzenegger’s house. \nKyle and Jon’s story shows that while celebrity status can open doors, it’s the execution, trust, and authenticity behind the company that keeps those doors open. Their credibility — rooted in Kyle’s career with the Minnesota Vikings, co-founder Jason Zucker’s career with the Buffalo Sabres, Jon’s operator background, and the early crowdfunding success that inspired their model — forms a powerful foundation of founder-market fit that’s hard to copy. \nTheir pivot from exclusive $10,000 golf events to accessible $10 sweepstakes demonstrates how democratizing access can actually elevate prestige when done with intention. \nAnd while not every founder begins with celebrity reach, every founder does begin with a network and the ability to grow influence. The real differentiator is how you activate it: strategically, authentically, and in ways that create clear value. Thought leadership is one of the most effective levers: sharing insights publicly; showing up on social media with purpose; writing, speaking, and consistently putting your ideas into the world. That’s how you become a “celebrity” in your own right, through credibility and contribution. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis episode isn’t about chasing fame.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12:06 PM PST · December 4, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said in an X post Thursday that owners can text and drive with the latest version of his company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software, despite the fact that it’s illegal to do so in most states. \nMusk replied to another user who had noticed the newest update to the software, known as FSD, was not flashing a warning as he used his phone while driving. The Tesla CEO wrote the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.” \nMusk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nNearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. \nDespite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. And drivers, who are warned by Tesla to keep their hands on the wheel even when FSD is engaged, are liable. \nFSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver assistance systems.\nMusk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident. Regulators have found more than a dozen fatal crashes in which Autopilot was active.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently investigating the FSD software after it discovered more than 50 reports of it running red lights or crossing into the wrong lanes. NHTSA is also probing FSD for reported crashes in low-visibility conditions. NHTSA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTesla is also near the end of a long legal battle with the California Department of Motor Vehicles over how the company has marketed FSD and its less-capable predecessor, Autopilot. During a series of hearings in July, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading customers for years that their cars can drive themselves. The state agency has asked a judge to suspend the company’s sale and manufacturing of its cars for at least 30 days. A decision in that case is expected by the end of this year.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nCalifornia regulators have released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways.\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, opened a 15-day comment period for the proposed revisions that ends December 18.\nCalifornia is home to numerous companies developing and testing autonomous vehicle technology in the state. And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads.\nThe agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday.\nThe revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. \nThe self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said.\nThe proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use self-driving trucks to carry freight along commerce-heavy freeways across states. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The California DMV’s latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towards bringing autonomous trucks to California freeways in 2026, a milestone that will enhance road safety and grow the economy.”\nThe Teamsters Union, which has fought to protect truck drivers, is unmoved. \n“Our position remains the same, we are opposed to the deployment and testing of this technology on our roads,” Shane Gusman, the legislative director for Teamsters California, told TechCrunch. “The changes that are made don’t change our position.”\nGusman noted that the Teamsters will fight the proposed revisions. It’s also lobbying for passage of AB 33, a bill currently on the state Senate floor, which would require a human safety operator behind the wheel of any heavy duty autonomous truck.\nThe DMV’s revised rules would require self-driving truck companies to go through a phased permitting process, mirroring current regulations applied to light-duty autonomous vehicles like robotaxis. Companies would first receive a permit to test with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The DMV issues separate permits for driverless testing and deployment.\nManufacturers would be required to conduct testing for a minimum number of miles prior to applying for a driverless testing permit and a deployment permit, under the DMV rules. For instance, self-driving truck companies would need to complete a minimum of 500,000 autonomous test miles — 100,000 of which must occur in the intended operational design domain in California — before it will receive a driverless permit.\nThe DMV also proposed revising rules that would affect light-duty autonomous vehicles. For instance, the regulations would expand the frequency and type of data reported to the department during testing and deployment and require companies to update plans on interacting with first responders on a more regular basis.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAI research lab Anthropic’s not slowing down in its efforts to snap up enterprise clients. The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base.\n“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” \nThis deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.  \nClaude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.  \n“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” \nAnthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.\nAnthropic in October signed a deal with Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a partnership with IBM to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnthropic’s enterprise success isn’t surprising as the company’s models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises.

    "body": "\nSpotify says yesterday’s launch of its annual year-in-review feature, Spotify Wrapped, was its biggest ever. The streaming service reports that Wrapped 2025 saw over 200 million engaged users within the first 24 hours,  19% more than last year’s AI-centered flop. Last year, it took Wrapped 62 hours to reach 200 million users, the company noted.\nEngaged users are counted as those who have viewed at least one of the stories within the Wrapped experience.\nIn addition, Spotify said Wrapped was shared more than 500 million times this year, 41% more than last year. This includes native shares from within the app, as well as screenshots and downloads.\nIn particular, markets like the U.S., India, Indonesia, Japan, Colombia, and Thailand drove the metrics this year.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nWrapped, the popular annual review of Spotify’s users’ listening history and stats, had a rough reception last year, as people criticized the lack of detailed stats, and the focus on the inclusion of an AI podcast over other clever and creative data stories.\nSpotify took that feedback into account for this year’s Wrapped, adding nearly a dozen new features and deeper data drives. While it did use AI behind the scenes, the new Wrapped didn’t include a consumer-facing AI experience. \nInstead, Spotify focused on letting users connect with each other by allowing them to compare their “listening age,” their Wrapped group (a category of listeners), and with its first live, multiplayer feature, Wrapped Party, that offered real-time data and stat comparisons.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "Based on a leaked video, security researchers alleged that Intellexa staffers have remote live access to their customers' surveillance systems, allowing them to see hacking targets’ personal data.",
    "body": "\nSpyware maker Intellexa had remote access to some of its government customers’ surveillance systems, giving company staffers the ability to see the personal data of people whose phones had been hacked with its Predator spyware, according to new evidence published by Amnesty International. \nOn Thursday, Amnesty and a coalition of media partners, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Greek news site Inside Story, and Swiss outlet Inside IT, published a series of reports based on leaked material from Intellexa, including internal company documents, sales and marketing material, and training videos. \nPerhaps the most striking revelation is that people working at Intellexa could allegedly remotely access the surveillance systems of at least some of its customers via TeamViewer, an off-the-shelf tool that allows users to connect to other computers over the internet.\nThe remote access is shown in a leaked training video revealing privileged parts of the Predator spyware system, including its dashboard, as well as the “storage system containing photos, messages and all other surveillance data gathered from victims of the Predator spyware,” Amnesty wrote in its report. (Amnesty published screenshots taken from the video, but not the full video.)\nThe nonprofit researchers wrote that the leaked video shows apparent “live” Predator infection attempts “against real targets,” based on detailed information “from at least one infection attempt against a target in Kazakhstan.” The video contained the infection URL, the target’s IP address, and the software versions of the target’s phone.\nA screenshot of the dashboard of an Intellexa customer surveillance system, which shows the types of sensitive personal data of hacked targets that customers and Intellexa support staff may have access to. Image Credits:Amnesty International\nCompanies that sell spyware to government agencies, such as NSO Group and the now-defunct Hacking Team, have long maintained that they never have access to the data of their customers’ targets, nor their customers’ systems. There are several reasons why. \nFrom the point of view of the spyware makers, they don’t want the potential legal liability if their customers use the spyware unlawfully. And spyware makers would rather say that once they sell their spyware, the customers are fully responsible for using it. From the government customers’ standpoint, they don’t want to expose details of their sensitive investigations, such as targets’ names, locations, and personal data, to a private company that may be based overseas.\nIn other words, this type of remote access is absolutely not “normal,” as Paolo Lezzi, the chief executive of spyware maker Memento Labs, told TechCrunch when contacted for this story to ask from the perspective of a spyware maker. “No [government] agency would accept it,” he said.\nThat’s why Lezzi was skeptical that the leaked training video was showing access to an actual customer’s live surveillance system. Perhaps, he posited, this was training material showing a demo environment. The chief executive also said that some customers have asked Memento Labs to have access to their systems, but the company only accepts the offer if it’s necessary to solve technical issues. In any case, he said, “they enable us to have TeamViewer access for the necessary time and under their supervision we carry out the intervention and leave.”\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Intellexa? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nAmnesty, however, is convinced that the leaked video does show access to live Predator surveillance systems. \n“One of the staff in the training call ask if it was a demo environment, and the instructor confirmed it was a live customer system,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of Amnesty’s security lab, which did the technical analysis of the leaked material and has investigated several cases of Predator infections.   \nThe claim that Intellexa staffers had visibility into who their customers were spying on raised Amnesty’s concerns about security and privacy.\n“These findings can only add to the concerns of potential surveillance victims. Not only is their most sensitive data exposed to a government or other spyware customer, but their data risks being exposed to a foreign surveillance company, which has demonstrable issues in keeping their confidential data stored securely,” the nonprofit wrote in the report. \nIntellexa could not be reached for comment. A lawyer speaking on behalf of Intellexa’s founder, Tal Dilian, told Haaretz that Dilian has “not committed any crime nor operated any cyber system in Greece or anywhere else.”\nDilian is one of the more controversial people in the world of government spyware. A veteran of the spyware industry previously told TechCrunch that Dilian “moves like an elephant in a crystal shop,” implying he made little effort to conceal his activities.\n“In that particular space of spyware sellers you have to be extremely balanced and attentive … but he didn’t care,” said the person.\nIn 2024, the U.S. government announced sanctions against Tal Dilian and one of his business partner, Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou. In that case, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions based on allegations that Intellexa’s spyware was used against Americans, including U.S. government officials, journalists, and policy experts. The sanctions make it illegal for American companies and nationals to have any commercial relationship with Dilian and Hamou.\nThat was the first time the U.S. government, which has taken actions against spyware developer NSO Group, targeted a specific person involved in the industry.  \nIn his response to Haaretz, Dilian accused journalists of being “useful idiots” in an “orchestrated campaign” to hurt him and his company, which was “fed into the Biden administration.”\n"

    "description": "Day One Ventures' Masha Bucher doesn't just invest in startups — she also tells their stories. Her integrated model aligns incentives and proves conviction matters more than contracts.",
    "body": "\nBefore she was a VC, Masha Bucher worked in PR and marketing — an experience that has shaped the way she runs Day One Ventures.\nAfter years of working in communications — including executive roles that gave her deep insight into how startups operate — Bucher realized she could either use her business acumen to become one of the most effective PR reps in the game, or evolve into something more.\n“I was seeing what was going on in business, and because I could understand the context, I understood business, and because I understood business, my PR pitches would be very business focused,” Bucher told TechCrunch on today’s episode of Equity.\nShe founded Day One Ventures in 2018 after realizing she could create more impact — and make better returns — by investing in startups and providing them with integrated PR support. By combining these two functions, she could help portfolio companies more meaningfully while backing only the stories she truly believed in.\n“The structure of PR services is very misaligned,” Bucher said, noting that PR firms working on a contract basis often lean toward working slower so they can stretch out client payments. “For startups, it’s really important to move fast.”\nBeyond speed, there’s a cost barrier: “Early-stage companies shouldn’t be paying $10, $20, or $30 grand per month for six months to get one announcement in TechCrunch. I just don’t think that’s fair, and I don’t think it’s sustainable.”\nDay One’s integrated model allows Bucher to work with startups at critical early stages when they need support most. Younger startups might pivot or experience founder shake-ups, and “you need to be trusted to advise and help them make decisions.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBacking a company financially gives her something many traditional PR firms can’t offer: She’s literally invested in the story.\n“I have an ambition to be, ideally, the first investor in the most important and ambitious ideas and companies of our time,” Bucher said. “I think that starts with you understanding the field, understanding the business, getting a conviction on the business. And once you have this conviction — which you’ve proved by investing in the company — you have the right to introduce it to reporters with much higher integrity.”\nSomeone in PR who gets access to everything from investor decks to a startup’s data room has serious advantages in positioning the company and understanding what’s at stake. And for Bucher, it makes the work more compelling. Doing PR for whatever companies are big enough to pay might be good business, “but that doesn’t mean it’s a good story.”\nAs with any VC, Bucher answers to her investors — in Day One’s case, that’s more than 70 LPs, including institutions, individuals, and more than 15 of the firm’s own portfolio founders. That means her bets need to be carefully considered. When Bucher chooses companies, she’s not only asking whether she wants to see their vision become reality, but whether the founder has the ethics and moral compass to maintain their values as the company scales. \nShe points to Valar Atomics, a startup developing advance nuclear reactors, as an example. Day One co-led a $130 million round into the startup last month. \n“I can’t think of a better founder,” she said, referring to Valar’s CEO Isaiah Taylor, noting she trusts him with “literally life-and-death” decisions. \nThat moral filter means there are companies she wouldn’t back, even if they’re getting hype. Bucher said she wasn’t swayed by AI startup Cluely’s rage-bait “cheat on everything” marketing strategy. Rather, she’s proud to have invested in some of the most innovative technologies in areas like reproductive tech (Orchid’s embryo selection technology), accessible healthcare (Superpower), and law-enforcement software (Abel’s AI-optimized report-writing tools).\nDay One’s portfolio includes early bets on companies like Sam Altman’s World, the email app Superhuman, and the remote work platform Remote.com, with at least 12 unicorns under its belt and $115 billion-plus in portfolio value. Last year, Day One closed its Fund III with $150 million, targeting early-stage founders “solving humanity’s most pressing issues,” and has grown over the last six years from $11 million in assets under management to well over $450 million today, says Bucher.\n“We want to use comms to solve companies’ business goals, unlock new opportunities, and to help them, ultimately, to grow shareholder value,” Bucher said.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

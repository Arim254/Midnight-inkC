Bloomberg recently published a report about Tesla owners and passengers getting stuck in their vehicles because of the company’s hard-to-find manual releases. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation, and Tesla has since said it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/tesla-is-redesigning-its-door-handles-following-safety-probe-bloomberg-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\">redesigning how those work</a>. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Ford issued a <a href=\"https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a65125258/ford-mustang-mach-e-stop-sale-recall-rear-doors/\" target=\"_blank\">recall and stopped the sale</a> of its Mustang Mach-E because its electronic latches could get stuck in a locked position if the car’s 12-volt battery died.</p>\n</div>"

Elon Musk has spent years predicting humans will colonize Mars and suggested a million people could live there by 2050, which is right around the corner, basically. Maybe both gazillionaires are losing touch, or else they know something the rest of us refreshing Zillow do not.</p>\n<p>Bezos was equally bullish on other fronts, defending the AI investment boom as a “good” kind of bubble given that it’s “industrial” rather than “financial.” </p>\n<p>“There has never been a better time to be excited about the future,” he reportedly said, as audience members (in our imagination) exchanged uncertain glances across the Turin auditorium.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Space</h2><p></p>\n</div>"

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/snapchat-caps-free-memory-storage-launches-paid-storage-plans/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> last week that it’s capping free Memories storage at 5GB. </p>\n<p>If your Memories exceed the limit, you will need to either export them or sign up for one of Snapchat’s new Memories Storage plans in order to preserve them. </p>\n<p>The company told TechCrunch in an email that the introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription.</p>\n<p>If you’re over the limit but don’t sign up for a plan, your oldest Snaps will be saved, while the most recent ones will be deleted to stay within the storage limit.</p>\n<p>Although the company has given users 12 months of temporary storage for Memories that exceed the 5GB limit, some users are proactively choosing to export their Memories instead of paying up. </p>\n<p>We’ll walk you through the two options you have for preserving your Snapchat Memories. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-export-your-snapchat-memories-to-your-device-s-camera-roll\">Export your Snapchat Memories to your device’s camera roll</h2>\n<p>One way to save your Snapchat Memories is by downloading them to your camera roll.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI is gearing up to host its third annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.</p>\n<p>From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/\">building an AI device</a>, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">social media app</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/\">an AI-powered browser</a> to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.</p>\n<p>At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.</p>\n<p>OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/openai-launches-gpt-4-turbo-and-launches-fine-tuning-program-for-gpt-4/\">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/app-store-for-ai-build-your-own-gpt-and-sell-it-on-openais-gpt-store/\">the GPT Store</a>. Altman was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/sam-altman-is-out-as-openais-ceo/\">ousted as CEO</a> days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/openais-devday-brings-realtime-api-and-other-treats-for-ai-app-developers/\">API for AI voice applications</a>, but not much else.</p>\n<p>Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched last year.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/OpenAI\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s YouTube page</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.</p>\n<p>For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.</p>\n<p>There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora.

YC is estimated to accept <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/investors\" target=\"_blank\">around 1% of applicants</a>, and at a certain point, some luck is required to really capture a partner’s eye — maybe your pitch is the first that a partner watched after a very rejuvenating coffee break, or maybe your company is the last video on the list and everyone’s tired.</p>\n<p>“Many rejected founders went on to build incredibly successful companies afterwards,” reads a note at the start of the game. “Rejection means nothing — even the most successful founders got rejected multiple times.”</p>\n<p>YC Arena has other games that ask you to match a company name to its logo, or guess what year a company did YC based on its description (spoiler alert: There’s a lot more AI in recent years). But the YC Partner Simulator game is the most interesting since it makes us confront our own decision-making processes.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>As a tech journalist, I thought I would be pretty good at the YC Partner Simulator. I may not be an investor, but I know what it’s like to sift through an inbox full of startup pitches and choose which ones pique my curiosity — I’ve walked the floor of TechCrunch Disrupt’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield 200 Expo</a> with the task of identifying companies to interview and write about. But this game is hard. After all, we’re working within different parameters, since the newsworthiness of a company is not directly tied to its potential to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>(For example: As I write this, there’s an AI pet sitting in my lap that I’m planning to review. Would I put money on the bet that Casio will turn a profit off the investment it takes to create <a href=\"https://www.casio.com/us/moflin/\" target=\"_blank\">a glorified Furby that retails for $430</a>? No. Do I expect that an article about my life with an AI pet will be interesting to readers? Yes.)</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>If anything, the game shows just how subjective these processes can be. But after I read YC co-founder Paul Graham’s <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply\" target=\"_blank\">application guide</a>, my guesses started to get more accurate.</p>\n<p>“You have to be exceptionally clear and concise,” Graham wrote. “Whatever you have to say, give it to us right in the first sentence, in the simplest possible terms.” (For the record, this advice also applies to emailing journalists.) </p>\n<p>I played the game again, but this time, I paid less attention to what the company was pitching and more attention to how quickly they could convey what their company does. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend this strategy for evaluating a startup in real life (hot take: you should care what a company does!), but for the purposes of the game, I ended up choosing a company’s fate more accurately.</p>\n<p>This probably isn’t a coincidence. When OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman was president of YC, he remarked in an interview that the incubator spent just <a href=\"https://x.com/StartupArchive_/status/1929568737876717917\" target=\"_blank\">10 minutes</a> reviewing each company’s application to make a decision.</p>\n<p>“It turns out that in 10 minutes, if the only question you’re trying to answer is, ‘Does this person have the potential to be the next Mark Zuckerberg?’ … You can answer that question in 10 minutes,” Altman said in 2016. “Not with 100 percent accuracy, obviously, but good enough that our business model works.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tesla has been hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI) for routinely denying or delaying customer claims despite years of warnings from the state regulator, according to <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/release064-2025.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">a new pair of filings</a>.</p>\n<p>Tesla’s insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in “willful unfair claims settlement practices” including “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps” of the process and “unreasonable denials,” CDI wrote. This has allegedly caused “financial harm” and “distress to policyholders.”</p>\n<p>CDI first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings, yet it claims things have only gotten worse. “In 2025, the Tesla Companies have already had more complaints, more justified complaints, and committed more violations than in the three previous years combined,” the regulator wrote. </p>\n<p>Tesla and State National could face penalties up to $5,000 for each “unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act” and up to $10,000 for each “willful” act, according to the filings. The companies have 15 days to respond. </p>\n<p>The enforcement action could have knock-on legal effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/teslas-auto-insurance-arm-hit-with-consumer-class-action-california-2025-07-17/\" target=\"_blank\">company purposely delayed and minimized claim payouts</a>. CDI wrote Friday that Tesla’s actions may have created “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla and State National did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Tesla launched its in-house insurance product in 2019. The idea was to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. But it got off to a rocky start. The website repeatedly crashed, and when it didn’t, it offered quotes that were far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20839607/tesla-car-insurance-broken-high-rate-quotes-california\" target=\"_blank\">higher than owners expected</a>. Still, Musk promised it would be a “revolutionary” product.</p>\n<p>Just three years later, according to CDI’s filings, the regulator noticed a “marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints” against Tesla. So in December 2022, CDI started meeting with Tesla and State National. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The regulator said it learned Tesla’s “Head of Claims” position had been vacant for months. It also accused the companies of not reporting the claims-handling problems.</p>\n<p>As a result, CDI subjected Tesla and State National to a sort of probationary period: the regulator monitored the companies’ efforts to reduce these violations for six months. Tesla and State National “conceded” that they had underestimated the volume of claims and the staffing required to handle them, according to CDI, and promised to beef up hiring.</p>\n<p>It took Tesla until April 2023 to hire a new Head of Claims. Through the rest of that year, Tesla and State National “reported improvements in the quality” of their claims handling and the “resolution of consumer complaints.” </p>\n<p>Later that year, Reuters published <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\">an investigation into Tesla’s insurance arm</a> that showed things weren’t so rosy. </p>\n<p>CDI came to the same realization in 2024. The regulator noticed a “significant increase” in both consumer complaints against Tesla and “violations of the law,” according to the filings. CDI had received just 83 consumer complaints against Tesla in 2022, but in 2024, that number jumped to 829. In 775 of those cases, CDI found Tesla had violated the state’s insurance code.</p>\n<p>Things have only gotten worse, according to CDI. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified 1,969 insurance code violations.</p>\n<p>In total, since 2022, CDI said Tesla has accumulated nearly 3,000 violations of state insurance law. The majority of those violations involve Tesla failing to respond to customers within the mandatory 15-day period. CDI said it identified 166 violations in which Tesla filed to conduct a “thorough, fair, and objective investigation” into a claim.</p>\n<p>“CDI repeatedly notified [Tesla] of its claims-mishandling issues and violations of law,” the regulator wrote. “While [Tesla] repeatedly committed to improvements, the number of justified complaints and violations continued to mount, demonstrating [Telsa’s] failure to correct its practices.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Here, shortcut buttons to do things like “Create Image” or access “Deep Research” were moved up on the screen and were then followed by the scrollable feed.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson said there’s no announcement to be made “just yet.” </p>\n<p>In the examples shown, prompts suggested fun things to do with your photos, like “Teleport me to deep space,” “Give me a vintage or grunge look,” or “Turn my drawing into a storybook,” among other things. Other prompts featuring a colorful background offered different ideas of things to ask Gemini, or suggested use cases. For instance, one prompt idea said “Brainstorm out loud with Live,” and another said “Send me a daily news roundup.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"screenshots showing gemini's new interface with colorful prompts and images\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg 1818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=768,564 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=680,499 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=1200,881 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=1280,939 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=430,316 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=720,528 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=900,660 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=800,587 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=1536,1127 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=668,490 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=511,375 511w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=841,617 841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=708,520 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-scrollable-home-screen-apk-teardown-3603097/\" target=\"_blank\">Android Authority <span>(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea is to inspire users with more specific suggestions of how to use Gemini’s AI, rather than leaving them to figure out the AI chatbot’s capabilities on their own.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Agriculture is a thirsty industry, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/water-use-stress\">consuming 70% of all fresh water used worldwide</a>. In some countries, like India or Chile, it can be more than 90%.</p>\n<p>For Mario Bustamante, who lives in Chile, the problem hits close to home. “Lack of water is a big issue here,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Bustamante is betting that AI can help slash water use in farms across the world. His startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/instacrops/\">Instacrops</a>, was originally founded to deploy internet-of-things (IoT) sensors on farms to warn farmers about damaging frost conditions, but as the hardware became commoditized, the company pivoted to software and water use.</p>\n<p>Now, Instacrops is helping 260 farms cut their water use up to 30% while also increasing crop yields by as much as 20%. The company is part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a>, and it will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&display=\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> later this month in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>The switch from hardware to AI turned the company on its head, allowing it to operate with fewer staff and while processing more data. </p>\n<p>“We are processing — more or less — 15 million data points per hour. Almost 10 years ago, that was the amount for a year,” Bustamante said. “We’re reducing cost, team members, and generating more impact with less.”</p>\n<p>Instacrops can install new IoT sensors or connect to a farm’s existing network and collect data from them to advise farmers when to irrigate different areas.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI has acquired Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. In keeping with a recent trend in the AI industry, only the CEO is making the jump.  </p>\n<p>Chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1974190926177460670?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the acquisition on Friday, and a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch he is the only one of Roi’s four-person staff to join OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15. </p>\n<p>The Roi deal marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-hires-team-behind-gv-backed-ai-eval-platform-context-ai/\">Context.ai</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/openai-hires-team-behind-ai-recommendation-startup-crossing-minds/\">Crossing Minds</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/openai-hires-the-team-behind-xcode-coding-assistant-alex-codes/\">Alex</a>.</p>\n<p>While it’s not clear whether any of Roi’s technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI’s bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly.   </p>\n<p>New York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user’s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades.  </p>\n<p>“We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1974190926177460670?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a>. “Along the way we realized personalization isn’t just the future of finance. It’s the future of software.” </p>\n<p>Beyond tracking trades, Roi gave users access to a financially savvy AI companion that responded in ways that made sense for them. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>In one telling example that <a href=\"https://x.com/investwithroi/status/1886506081087807532\" target=\"_blank\">Roi posted on X</a>, the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like I’m a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you want I don’t mind.” In response to a query about the status of the user’s portfolio, Roi replied: “Suje, you got cooked lil bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.” </p>\n<p>The exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder — that software shouldn’t just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep you engaged.  </p>\n<p>As the Roi team wrote in a blog post: “The products we use every day won’t remain static, predetermined experiences. They’ll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.” </p>\n<p>That vision dovetails with OpenAI’s existing consumer efforts, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\" target=\"_blank\">Pulse</a>, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">Sora</a> app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Checkout</a>, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT.  </p>\n<p>The deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team,  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/instacart-ceo-fidji-simo-is-joining-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo</a>. It’s a further signal that OpenAI isn’t just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Roi’s talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive.  </p>\n<p>Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue. By his <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1628097851770417152\" target=\"_blank\">account</a>, a simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in additional cash.  </p>\n<p>Being able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">billions on data centers and infrastructure</a> to power its models.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of package and car thefts. </p>\n<p>The popular internet-connected security camera maker <a href=\"https://community.eufy.com/t/help-improve-eufy-ai-earn-cash/4662267\" target=\"_blank\">said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems</a> to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.  </p>\n<p>“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.  </p>\n<p>“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.” </p>\n<p>Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”  </p>\n<p>This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.  </p>\n<p>Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/\" target=\"_blank\">a viral calling app</a> that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data</a>. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-videos-donated-to-train-ai\">Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI</h2>\n<p>Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.  </p>\n<p>The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.” Eufy users could participate by filling out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MnlPD7oI9yf9eb56ttG_otnMdFg60VwVHtlmtRDk6hJzkQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">a Google Form</a> where they could upload videos and their PayPal account for payment.  </p>\n<p>Eufy did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment and our questions, such as how many users participated in the campaign, how much money it paid those users, how many videos the company collected, and whether the company deleted the collected videos after training its AI systems.  </p>\n<p>Since then, Eufy has similar campaigns aimed at incentivizing its customers to send in videos to train their AI. </p>\n<p>As of the time of publication, through another in-app campaign that Eufy calls the Video Donation Program to improve its AI systems, Eufy also offers users rewards that range from an “Apprentice Medal,” which appears to simply be a badge next to the user’s name in the app, to gifts such as cameras or gift cards. </p>\n<p>Eufy is only asking for videos involving humans for this campaign. </p>\n<p>The Eufy app also shows an “Honor Wall” that ranks users who have donated the most video events. The leader of the ranking has donated 201,531 videos, according to the app.  </p>\n<p>In the app’s page for the donation program, Eufy clarifies that “donated videos are only used for Al training and improvement. Eufy will not provide the video to third parties.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?w=337\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=768,1550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=595,1200 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=634,1280 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=213,430 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=357,720 357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=446,900 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=396,800 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=761,1536 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=1015,2048 1015w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=331,668 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=186,375 186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=306,617 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=263,531 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Eufy/Anker (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Eufy also <a href=\"https://service.anker.com/article-description/How-to-Donate-eufy-Baby-Monitor-2-Videos-in-the-eufy-Care-App\" target=\"_blank\">asks users to donate</a> videos recorded with the company’s baby monitors.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>AI coding tools are getting better fast. If you don’t work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 2.4 did it again.  </p>\n<p>At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. If you are using AI to write emails, you’re probably getting the same value out of it you did a year ago. Even when the model gets better, the product doesn’t always benefit — particularly when the product is a chatbot that’s doing a dozen different jobs at the same time. AI is still making progress, but it’s not as evenly distributed as it used to be. </p>\n<p>The difference in progress is simpler than it seems. Coding apps are benefitting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. This is reinforcement learning (RL), arguably the biggest driver of AI progress over the past six months and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\">getting more intricate all the time</a>. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there’s a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input.  </p>\n<p>As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we’re seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can’t. RL-friendly skills like bug-fixing and competitive math are getting better fast, while skills like writing make only incremental progress. </p>\n<p>In short, there’s a reinforcement gap — and it’s becoming one of the most important factors for what AI systems can and can’t do. </p>\n<p>In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn’t break before they deployed it. So even the most elegant code still needs to pass through unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and so on. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\" target=\"_blank\">as Google’s senior director for dev tools recently told me</a>, they’re just as useful for validating AI-generated code. Even more than that, they’re useful for reinforcement learning, since they’re already systematized and repeatable at a massive scale. </p>\n<p>There’s no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. But not every task falls neatly into “easy to test” or “hard to test” categories. We don’t have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some testing kits will work better than others, of course, and some companies will be smarter about how to approach the problem. But the testability of the underlying process is going to be the deciding factor in whether the underlying process can be made into a functional product instead of just an exciting demo.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you’d asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s new Sora 2 model</a> shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Faces hold their shape, looking like a specific person rather than just a collection of features. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nunil1/sora_2_vs_veo_3_on_physics_test_sora_2_is_first/\" target=\"_blank\">obvious</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/pallavmac/status/1973141663557226806\" target=\"_blank\">subtle</a> ways. I suspect that, if you peeked behind the curtain, you’d find a robust reinforcement learning system for each of these qualities. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. </p>\n<p>To be clear, this isn’t a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It’s a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. But as long as RL is the primary tool for bringing AI products to market, the reinforcement gap will only grow bigger — with serious implications for both startups and the economy at large. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career. The question of which healthcare services are RL-trainable, for instance, has enormous implications for the shape of the economy over the next 20 years. And if surprises like Sora 2 are any indication, we may not have to wait long for an answer.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nWhat happens when the software that everyone’s racing to adopt becomes too risky for anyone to insure? According to reporting from the Financial Times, we’re about to find out.\nMajor insurers including AIG, Great American, and WR Berkley are asking U.S. regulators for permission to exclude AI-related liabilities from corporate policies. One underwriter describes the AI models’ outputs to the FT as “too much of a black box.”\nThe industry has good reason to be spooked, the story reminds us. Google’s AI Overview falsely accused a solar company of legal troubles, triggering a $110 million lawsuit back in March. Air Canada last year got stuck honoring a discount its chatbot invented. And fraudsters last year used a digitally cloned version of a senior executive to steal $25 million from the London-based design engineering firm Arup during a video call that seemed entirely real.\nWhat really terrifies insurers isn’t one massive payout; it’s the systemic risk of thousands of simultaneous claims when a widely used AI model steps in it. As one Aon executive put it, insurers can handle a $400 million loss to one company. What they can’t handle is an agentic AI mishap that triggers 10,000 losses at once.\n"

If signed, the order would probably face significant opposition, including from Republicans who previously criticized the proposed moratorium on state regulation.\nAI regulation has also been a controversial topic in Silicon Valley, with some industry figures — especially those in the Trump administration — attacking companies like Anthropic for supporting AI safety bills including California’s SB 53.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

    "body": "\nByju Raveendran, the embattled founder of Indian ed-tech giant Byju’s, has blasted a U.S. bankruptcy court’s order directing him to pay more than $1.07 billion. He is denying wrongdoing, accusing lenders of misleading the court, and vowing to appeal a ruling that marks a dramatic fall for a onetime poster boy of India’s startup boom.\nThe Delaware bankruptcy judge issued a default judgment after finding that Raveendran had repeatedly ignored court orders and provided “evasive, incomplete” responses regarding about $533 million that Byju’s U.S. unit allegedly transferred in 2022 and never recovered. The judge also cited issues with a separate limited-partnership stake later valued at roughly $540.6 million. The ruling, dated November 20, stems from legal action by lenders seeking to claw back funds linked to the $1.2 billion term loan they extended to the ed-tech startup in 2021.\nEarlier this year, in April, a group of U.S. lenders led by GLAS Trust sued Raveendran and his wife, Byju’s co-founder Divya Gokulnath, in the Delaware bankruptcy court over the missing $533 million in loan proceeds. The couple denied wrongdoing at the time and accused lenders of attempting a hostile takeover of the company. They later said they planned to pursue a $2.5 billion lawsuit against GLAS Trust and others in India and other jurisdictions, though no such filing has publicly surfaced. This was in addition to the complaint Byju’s filed in the New York Supreme Court challenging the acceleration of the term loan in 2023.\nThe court’s latest order followed a September 29 hearing on the default request, where the judge cited a months-long pattern of noncompliance. The judge noted that Raveendran skipped hearings, missed extended deadlines, and ignored a prior contempt order imposing $10,000 in daily sanctions that remain unpaid.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon said the relief granted in the case was “extraordinary,” adding that “the circumstances of this case are, frankly, unique and unlike anything the undersigned has encountered before, thereby making such relief… richly warranted.” The judge has given the parties seven days to respond to the ruling.\n“We consider that the U.S. Court erred in its judgment of this matter and will be filing the necessary appeals and other contestations related to this judgment and related orders,” said J. Michael McNutt, senior litigation advisor at Lazareff Le Bars, representing Raveendran, in a prepared statement to TechCrunch. “The court, in our view, ignored relevant facts.”\nRaveendran’s legal counsel argued that the court issued the judgment without giving him an opportunity to present a defense and instead relied on an earlier contempt order. The counsel also argued that the ruling failed to acknowledge that GLAS Trust was aware the Alpha loan funds were not used for the personal benefit of Raveendran or other founders but rather for Think & Learn, the startup’s parent company, the counsel said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe counsel said Byju’s founders are preparing claims against GLAS Trust and others in multiple jurisdictions, expected to seek at least $2.5 billion in damages and, absent a settlement, to be filed before the end of 2025.\nNonetheless, the default judgment marks a stunning fall for Raveendran and his eponymous company, once India’s most valuable startup with a $22 billion valuation and backed by global investors including Tiger Global, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Prosus. The company is now mired in lawsuits, funding droughts, mass layoffs, and a battle for control as lenders and creditors race to recover what they can.\nRaveendran previously challenged the Delaware court’s jurisdiction, but the judge rejected that argument in an earlier ruling, writing that “Raveendran’s conduct that gives rise to the litigation here relates to his activities … in the United States fundraising and serving as a director, officer, or manager of a United States corporation.”\nEarlier this week, a filing in the Delaware bankruptcy case alleged that most of the $533 million missing from Byju’s U.S. unit, Alpha, was “round-tripped back to Byju Raveendran and associates.” In a response, Raveendran denied the allegation, saying the funds were not used for personal gain.\nMeanwhile in India, Byju’s is undergoing a court-supervised sale process after insolvency proceedings began last year, with early bidders including Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG) and Ronnie Screwvala’s UpGrad.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSierra, a 21-month-old, San Francisco-based startup that builds customer service AI agents for enterprises, announced on Friday that it reached $100 million in annual revenue run rate (ARR). The company’s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents.\nThe startup’s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: “That’s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.”\nSierra’s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM.\nTaylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra’s customers.\nThe company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages — essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents.\nSierra faces competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, but the company claims to be the leader in the AI customer service category.\nSierra was last valued at $10 billion when it raised a $350 million round led by Greenoaks Capital in September. Other investors in the company include Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBased on its $100 million ARR, Sierra is currently valued at a 100x revenue multiple, a hefty valuation despite its exceptionally fast growth.\nThe startup employs an outcomes-based pricing model, charging customers for completed work rather than charging flat subscription fees.\nTaylor and Bavor met at Google in 2005, where Taylor hired Bavor as an associate product manager.\nA Stanford computer science graduate, Taylor co-created Google Maps before founding FriendFeed, which Facebook acquired. At Facebook, he served as CTO and helped create the iconic “Like” button. He later founded Quip, a Google Docs competitor that Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016. \nTaylor went on to serve as Salesforce co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff for over a year. After Taylor left Salesforce in 2023, Bavor — who had spent 18 years at Google leading products like Gmail and Google Drive — invited him to lunch, where they decided to launch Sierra.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle has confirmed that hackers have stolen the Salesforce-stored data of more than 200 companies in a large-scale supply chain hack.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce disclosed a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” — without naming affected companies — that was stolen via apps published by Gainsight, which provides a customer support platform to other companies.  \nIn a statement, Austin Larsen, the principal threat analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said that the company “is aware of more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances.”\nAfter Salesforce announced the breach, the notorious and somewhat-nebulous hacking group known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility for the hacks in a Telegram channel, which TechCrunch has seen. \nThe hacking group claimed responsibility for hacks affecting Atlassian, CrowdStrike, Docusign, F5, GitLab, Linkedin, Malwarebytes, SonicWall, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches? Or other data breaches? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nGoogle would not comment on specific victims.\nCrowdStrike’s spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch in a statement that the company is “not affected by the Gainsight issue and all customer data remains secure.” CrowdStrike confirmed to TechCrunch that it terminated a “suspicious insider” for allegedly passing information to hackers.\nTechCrunch reached out to all the companies mentioned by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. \nVerizon spokesperson Kevin Israel said in a statement that “Verizon is aware of the unsubstantiated claim by the threat actor,” without providing evidence for this claim. \nMalwarebytes spokesperson Ashley Stewart told TechCrunch that the company’s security team is “aware” of the Gainsight and Salesforce issues and “actively investigating the matter.”\nA spokesperson for Thomson Reuters said the company is “actively investigating.”\nMichael Adams, the chief information security officer at Docusign told TechCrunch in a statement that “following a comprehensive log analysis and internal investigation, we have no indication of Docusign data compromise at this time.” However, Adams said that, “out of an abundance of caution, we have taken a number of measures including terminating all Gainsight integrations and containing related data flows.”\nAt the time of publishing, none of the other companies responded to requests for comment.\nHackers with the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch in an online chat that they gained access to Gainsight thanks to their previous hacking campaign that targeted customers of Salesloft, which provides an AI and chatbot-powered marketing platform called Drift. In that earlier case, the hackers stole Drift authentication tokens from those customers, allowing the hackers to break into their linked Salesforce instances and download their contents.\nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of that hacking campaign. \n“Gainsight was a customer of Salesloft Drift, they were affected and therefore compromised entirely by us,” a spokesperson for the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch.\nSalesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda told TechCrunch that “as a matter of policy, Salesforce does not comment on specific customer issues.”\nGainsight did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce said there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” effectively distancing itself from its customers’ data breaches.\nGainsight has been publishing updates about the incident on its incident page. On Friday, the company said that it is now working with Google’s incident response unit Mandiant to help investigate the breach, that the incident in question “originated from the applications’ external connection — not from any issue or vulnerability within the Salesforce platform,” and that “a forensic analysis is continuing as part of a comprehensive and independent review.”\n“Salesforce has temporarily revoked active access tokens for Gainsight-connected apps as a precautionary measure while their investigation into unusual activity continues,” according to Gainsight’s incident page, which said Salesforce is notifying affected customers whose data was stolen. \nIn its Telegram channel, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters said it plans to launch a dedicated website to extort the victims of its latest campaign by next week. This is the group’s modus operandi; in October, the hackers also published a similar extortion website after stealing victims’ Salesforce data in the Salesloft incident. \nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of English-speaking hackers made up of several cybercriminal gangs, including ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$, whose members use social engineering tactics to trick company employees into granting the hackers access to their systems or databases. In the last few years, these groups have claimed several high-profile victims, such as MGM Resorts, Coinbase, DoorDash, and more.\nThis story was updated to include comments from Docusign, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n"

    "body": "\nConventional wisdom suggests that climate tech is entering a winter season, where political and investor interest and investment levels are cooling — an ironic contrast with the climate itself, which keeps delivering years of record warmth. \nA new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago, it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation. \nIn 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050.\nFast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040.\nForecasts from the IEA have shifted significantly in the last decade.Image Credits:International Energy Agency/TechCrunch under a CC BY 4.0 (opens in a new window) license.\nToday, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time.\nIf the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections?\nHow you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time? (An even nerdier way to look at it is, do you view the world through a lens of algebra or calculus?)\nPut another way, will the world hit net zero in 2050? Today’s trend lines suggest we’ll miss that target by a wide margin. But if you look at how expectations have changed over the last decade, you might come up with a different answer. Instead, you might think the rate of change has increased, that we might be in the middle of an inflection point that starts to bend global emissions downward.\nThere are a few recent anecdotes to support the idea that we’re at an inflection point. \nIn Germany, sales of electric vehicles have set new records even after the government repealed incentives in 2023. In developing countries, renewables are reshaping the economies of developing countries, which were long thought to be among the last to adopt clean power. And China, which had previously refused to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, has now said its emissions will peak before 2030. \nHow the world views the future of carbon emissions has changed significantly over the past decade. A range of technologies have made that happen, including cheap solar and wind power paired with inexpensive batteries. \nIn the near future, geothermal energy and grid-optimizing software could propel the next leaps in optimism. For investors who agree, the upside could be dramatic.\nFor many climate tech investors, these days probably feel pretty gloomy. But amidst the gloom, there are still bright patches to be found.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nHi, thanks as always for reading TechCrunch. We want to talk with you quickly about something important. \nA growing number of scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf. It ebbs and flows. Judging by the increased number of emails we’re receiving, asking, “Does this person really work for you?” it appears to be happening more actively at the moment.\nAnecdotally, this isn’t just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.\nHere’s an example of the most common scheme we’ve been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company’s products and requesting an introductory call.\nSharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don’t match our real employees’ credentials (see a list of bogus email addresses below). But more newly, they are hearing from fake reporters who claim to have address conventions that do match our own, making it tricker to recognize a TechCrunch employee from someone else claiming to be one. Indeed, the schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters’ writing styles, and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling, victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those exchanges to dig for even more proprietary details. A PR rep told Axios that someone posing as a TechCrunch reporter raised suspicions when they shared a scheduling link.\nWhy are they doing this? We don’t know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network or other sensitive information. In fact, former colleagues at Yahoo say these attempts align with a persistent threat actor they’ve been tracking who has historically engaged in TechCrunch impersonation to facilitate account takeover (ATO) and data theft, targeting cryptocurrency, cloud, and other tech companies using various pretexts.\nAs for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they’re legitimate, please don’t just take their word for it. We’ve made it easy for you to verify.\nStart by checking our TechCrunch staff page. It’s the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual’s name isn’t on our roster, you’ve got your answer right there.\nIf you do see someone’s name on our staff page, but our employee’s job description doesn’t square with the request you are receiving (e.g., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor may be trying to con you.\nIf it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.\nWe know it’s frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you’re not just protecting your own company — you’re also helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.\nThank you. And for your future reference, here’s a list of some of the TechCrunch impersonating domains that we’ve seen created within the last few months:\nemail-techcrunch[.]comhr-techcrunch[.]cominterview-techcrunch[.]commail-techcrunch[.]commedia-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-tc-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-techcrunch[.]compr-techcrunch[.]comtechcrunch-outreach[.]comtechcrunch-startups[.]infotechcrunch-team[.]comtechcrunch[.]aitechcrunch[.]biz[.]idtechcrunch[.]bztechcrunch[.]cctechcrunch[.]chtechcrunch[.]com[.]pltechcrunch[.]gltechcrunch[.]gstechcrunch[.]idtechcrunch[.]ittechcrunch[.]latechcrunch[.]lttechcrunch[.]net[.]cntechcrunch1[.]com\n"

    "description": "Young's age and background – things that might seem like disadvantages when it comes to more established industries – have become his secret weapons. When he walks into a room of executives twice or three times his age, he says, there's initial skepticism. \"Who the hell is this young guy and how does he know what he's talking about?\"",
    "body": "\nThomas Lee Young doesn’t sound like your typical Silicon Valley founder.\nThe 24-year-old CEO of Interface, a San Francisco startup using AI to prevent industrial accidents, is a white guy with a Caribbean accent and a Chinese last name, a combination he finds amusing enough to mention when he’s first introduced to business contacts. Born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago, the site of substantial oil and gas exploration activity, Young grew up around oil rigs and energy infrastructure because his entire family worked as engineers, stretching back generations to his great-grandfather, who immigrated to the island nation from China.\nThat background has become his calling card in pitch meetings with oil and gas executives today, but it makes for more than a great conversation starter; it underscores a path that has been anything but straightforward and that Young might argue gives Interface an edge.\nIt was years in the making. From age 11, Young fixated on Caltech with the intensity of someone much older. He watched shows about Silicon Valley online, mesmerized by the idea that people could build “anything and everything” in America. He did everything possible to secure admission, even writing his application essay about hijacking his family’s Roomba to create 3D spatial maps of his house.\nThe ploy worked – Caltech accepted him in 2020 – but then COVID-19 hit, and so did its ripple effects. For one thing, Young’s visa situation became nearly impossible (visa appointments were cancelled and processing came to a halt). At the same time, his college fund, carefully built over six or seven years to $350,000 to cover his education, “basically got hit entirely” by the abrupt market downturn in March of that year.\nWithout a lot of time to decide his future, he chose a cheaper three-year engineering program at the University of Bristol in the UK, studying mechanical engineering, but never abandoning his Silicon Valley dreams. “I was devastated,” he says, “but I realized I could still get something done.”\nAt Bristol, Young landed at Jaguar Land Rover, working in something called human factors engineering – essentially the UX and safety design of industrial systems. “I had never heard of it before I even joined,” he admits. The role involved figuring out how to make cars and manufacturing lines as safe as possible, ensuring they were “dummy proof” for smooth operations.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt was there, inside heavy industry, that Young saw the problem that would become Interface. He says the tools many companies use to manage safety documentation are either nonexistent – pen and paper – or so siloed and poorly designed that workers hate them. Worse, the operating procedures themselves — the instruction manuals and checklists that blue-collar workers rely on to stay safe — are riddled with errors, outdated, and nearly impossible to maintain.\nYoung pitched Jaguar on letting him build a solution, but the company wasn’t interested. So he started plotting his exit. When he learned about Entrepreneur First (EF), a European talent incubator that recruits promising individuals before they have a co-founder or even an idea, he cold applied despite its 1% acceptance rate. He was accepted to essentially pitch himself.\nHe told Jaguar he was going to a wedding in Trinidad and would be away for a week. Instead, he went to EF’s selection process, impressed the organizers, and the day he returned to the office, quit. “They realized, ‘Oh, so you probably weren’t at a wedding,’” he laughs.\nAt EF, Young met Aaryan Mehta, his future co-founder and CTO. Mehta, of Indian descent but born in Belgium, had his own thwarted American dream. He’d been accepted to both Georgia Tech and Penn but similarly couldn’t get a visa appointment during COVID. He ended up studying math and computer science at Imperial College London, where he developed AI for fault detection before building machine learning pipelines at Amazon.\n“We had similar backgrounds,” Young says. “He’s super international. He speaks five languages, very technical, amazing guy, and we got along very well.” In fact, they were the only team in their EF cohort not to break up, says Young.\nMore than that, today, they live together in San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood, though asked about spending so much time together, Young is adamant that that’s not an issue given their respective workloads. “Over the last week, I’ve seen [Aaryan] at home for maybe a combined total of 30 minutes.”\nAs for what, exactly, they are building, Interface’s pitch is straightforward: use AI to make heavy industry safer. The company autonomously audits operating procedures using large language models, cross-checking them against regulations, technical drawings, and corporate policies to catch errors that could – in a worst-case scenario – get workers killed.\nSome of the numbers are arresting. For one of Canada’s largest energy companies, where Interface is now deployed across three sites (Young declines to name the brand), Interface’s software found 10,800 errors and improvements across the company’s standard operating procedures in just two and a half months. As Young tells it, the same work done manually would have cost more than $35 million and taken two to three years.\nOne error Young found particularly troubling, he says, was a document that had been in circulation for 10 years with the wrong pressure range listed for a valve. “They’re just lucky that nothing happened,” says Medha Agarwal, a partner at Defy.vc, which led Interface’s $3.5 million seed round earlier this year, with participation from Precursor Ventures, Rockyard Ventures, and angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst.\nThe contracts are considerable. After initially trying outcome-based pricing (the energy company “hated it,” Young says), Interface adopted a hybrid per-seat model with overage costs. A single contract with the Canadian energy company is worth more than $2.5 million annually, and Interface has more fuel and oil services customers coming online in Houston, Guyana, and Brazil.\nThe total addressable market isn’t entirely clear, but it’s not small. In the U.S. alone, there are something like 27,000 oil and gas services companies, per the market research outfit IBISWorld, and that’s just the first vertical that Interface wants to tackle.\nThe outsider’s edge\nInterestingly, Young’s age and background – things that might seem like disadvantages when it comes to more established industries – have become his secret weapons. When he walks into a room of executives twice or three times his age, he says, there’s initial skepticism. “Who the hell is this young guy and how does he know what he’s talking about?”\nBut then, he says, he delivers his “wow moment,” by explaining an understanding of their operations, their workers’ daily routines, and exactly how much time and money Interface can save them. “Once you can flip them, they will absolutely love you and advocate and fight for you,” he says. (He claims that after a recent, first site visit with operators, five workers asked when they could invest in Interface, which made him particularly proud, given the field workers typically “hate software providers.”)\nIndeed, though Young works from Interface’s office in San Francisco’s Financial District, his hard hat sits on a table not far from his desk, ready for the next site visit. (Agarwal suggests Young could use a little more down time in his life, recalling a recent call where Young told her that he hadn’t seen the sun all day.)\nThe company now has eight employees – five in the office, three remote – mostly engineering hires, plus an operations person who started just this week. Interface’s biggest challenge is hiring fast enough to keep up with demand, a problem that requires its small team to tap networks across both Europe and the US.\nAs for what Young makes of the life in San Francisco he wanted and is now living, he marvels at how accurate the Silicon Valley stereotypes turned out to be. “You see people online talking about, ‘Oh, you go to a park and the person sitting next to you has raised $50 million building some insane AI agent.’ But it is actually like that,” he says. “I think back to what life was like in Trinidad. I mention these ideas to people back home, and they just don’t believe me.”\nHe occasionally makes time to go out in nature with friends – he says they went to Tahoe recently – and Interface hosts events like a hackathon they threw last weekend. But mostly, it’s work, and most of that work involves AI, just like everyone else’s in San Francisco right now.\nWhich makes the trips to oil rigs oddly appealing.\nIndeed, that hard hat at the office isn’t just a practical necessity; it’s also a lure, suggests Young. For engineers tired of building “some low-impact B2B sales or recruiting tool,” as Young puts it, the promise of occasionally leaving the Bay Area bubble to work with operators in the field has become a recruiting advantage. Less than 1% of San Francisco startups work in heavy industry, he notes, and that scarcity is part of the appeal, for him and for the people he’s hiring.\nIt’s probably not quite the version of the Silicon Valley dream he spent his childhood chasing from Trinidad: long hours, intense pressure, endless AI discussions everywhere, punctuated by the occasional trip to an oil rig.\nStill, for now, he doesn’t seem to mind it. “Over the last month or two months, I have not done much at all [outside the office], because there’s just been so much intensity here, with building, hiring, selling.” But “I feel pretty strong,” he adds.\n"

    "body": "\nWaymo continues to expand its reach, with the robotaxi company posting Friday that it’s now “officially authorized to drive fully autonomously across more of the Golden State.”\nWaymo already operates in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles (and outside California as well, in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix). But maps published by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles showed that the company can now test and deploy its autonomous vehicles across a much larger area in both the Bay Area and Southern California.\nIn the Bay Area, Waymo’s approved areas of operation now include most of the East Bay and North Bay (including Napa/Wine Country), as well as Sacramento. In Southern California, the company’s approved territory now stretches from Santa Clarita (north of Los Angeles) to San Diego.\n\nThe company will need additional regulatory approval before it can carry paying passengers in some of these regions, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\nAlthough Waymo’s post doesn’t offer many details about when it plans to actually start offering rides in all these new areas, the company wrote, “Next stop: welcoming riders in San Diego in mid-2026!”\nThe company had previously announced its intention to launch in San Diego next year, along with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.\nThere’s been plenty of Waymo expansion news in the past couple weeks, as the company announced that it will be entering Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa; is removing safety drivers ahead of its commercial launch in Miami; and will start offering rides that use freeways in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWe discussed the growth of Waymo and other robotaxi companies on the latest episode of the Equity podcast.

    "body": "\nIn the early days of social media, posting a rant about the latest episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” on Myspace felt like the ultimate Thursday night activity. And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds.\nNowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that.\nAvailable on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment.\nFor instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.”\nImage Credits:Phictly\nThe app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time.\n“Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.”\nKey features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page. Phictly also includes a “Talk Points” feature, allowing users to set check-in dates to discuss specific episodes or chapters and give everyone the opportunity to join the conversation.\nSimilar to Goodreads, users can also track what they are currently reading or watching, log titles, and set personal goals for their reading or viewing habits.\nFuture updates will introduce a matching system that pairs users based on shared interests, favorite genres, and common TV shows and books. The app will eventually expand to include clubs focused on video games.\nPhictly is free to download but may soon offer a premium subscription with additional features, such as the ability to create a private profile.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

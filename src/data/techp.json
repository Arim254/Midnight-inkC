Redmond first crossed the mark in July, but its valuation then dropped slightly to $3.9 trillion, before returning to $4 trillion on Tuesday on the back of news that it had signed a new agreement with OpenAI.\nApple’s growth has been impressive: It reached $1 trillion in 2018, $2 trillion in 2020, and $3 trillion in 2022. Apple’s stock has soared following the launch of the iPhone 17 range, which seem to be outselling previous versions. The company is set to report its Q4 2025 results on Thursday, October 30.\nMicrosoft has also been thriving, thanks to demand for its Azure cloud service, which offers OpenAI’s large language models as well as the computing power needed to train AI models. The company said on Tuesday that its roughly 27% stake in OpenAI was valued at about $135 billion.

    "description": "To achieve those goals, OpenAI is betting on two key strategies: continued algorithmic innovation and dramatically scaling up \"test time compute\" — essentially how long models spend thinking about problems.",
    "body": "\nOpenAI says its deep learning systems are rapidly advancing, with models increasingly able to solve complex tasks faster. So fast, in fact, that internally, OpenAI is tracking toward achieving an intern-level research assistant by September 2026 and a fully automated “legitimate AI researcher” by 2028, CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream Tuesday.  \nThe ambitious timeline comes on the same day OpenAI finalized its transition to a public benefit corporation structure, moving away from its non-profit roots. This restructuring releases OpenAI from limitations tied to its non-profit charter, while also opening up new opportunities for capital raising. \nJakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s chief scientist, joined Altman on the livestream. He described this AI researcher — not to be confused with a human who researches AI — as a “system capable of autonomously delivering on larger research projects.”  \n“We believe that it is possible that deep learning systems are less than a decade away from superintelligence,” Pachocki added. He described superintelligence as systems smarter than humans across a large number of critical actions.  \nTo achieve those goals, OpenAI is betting on two key strategies: continued algorithmic innovation and dramatically scaling up “test time compute” — essentially how long models spend thinking about problems. Current models can handle tasks with a roughly five-hour time horizon and match top human performers in competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad, Pachocki said. But he believes this horizon will extend rapidly, in part by allowing models to spend far more computational resources thinking through complex problems. For major scientific breakthroughs, he said, it would be worth dedicating entire data centers’ worth of computing power to a single problem. \nOpenAI says these goals are in line with the firm’s overall push to advance scientific research and allow AI to potentially make discoveries faster than human researchers, tackle complex problems beyond current human capabilities, and dramatically speed up technological innovation across multiple fields like medicine, physics, and technology development.  \nAltman also said the restructuring creates a framework to support OpenAI’s aggressive timeline for AI research assistants while maintaining a commitment to responsible AI development. Under the new structure, the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, which is focused on scientific advancement, will own 26% of the for-profit and will govern the research direction. The non-profit also has a $25 billion commitment to use AI for curing diseases and will help manage AI research and safety initiatives.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPer Altman, the for-profit arm’s ability to raise more funds means it can scale the necessary infrastructure buildout to achieve scientific advancements. Altman said OpenAI has committed to 30 gigawatts of infrastructure, which is a $1.4 trillion financial obligation, over the next few years.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nNetflix has rolled out a new TV experience for kids’ profiles on its service globally, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Tuesday. The update, which aims to simplify the design and navigation, is the company’s latest attempt to connect users to content they’ll like more quickly.\nIn May, Netflix introduced a similar redesign of its TV homepage for standard profiles, which added an AI-powered search tool, better recommendations, and more visible shortcuts, among other changes. \nNow, the company says that the same update has arrived on kids’ profiles, along with other tweaks aimed specifically at Netflix’s youngest users.\n\nThe new design simplified the look and feel of the homepage. It also offers a new navigation bar at the top that links to “My Netflix,” a section that brings together everything kids have watched, saved, and loved in a single place. This makes it easier for users to revisit favorite content — something that younger users often do by rewatching their top movies and episodes.\nIn addition, Netflix says kids’ recommendations will refresh in real-time, as they do on standard profiles. The company hopes this will decrease the time kids spend searching for something to watch. \nSome things on the Kids profile won’t change, however: the Character Themed Rows, Mystery Box suggestions, and parental controls are still available.\nNetflix also announced other updates for Netflix today, including features like real-time voting, live party games, podcasts, and more. Next year, for instance, Netflix will launch real-time voting on its upcoming new show “Star Search,” after earlier tests with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.”\nThe company says the new user interface is tied to these changes, as it offers a more flexible canvas for different types of creative content, including interactive content. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOwen Sakawa, the founder of Elloe AI, wants his platform to be the “immune system for AI” and the “antivirus for any AI agent.”  \nThe idea, Sakawa said in an interview days before the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, where Elloe AI is a Top 20 finalist in the Startup Battlefield competition, is to add a layer to companies’ LLMs that checks for bias, hallucinations, errors, compliance issues, misinformation, and unsafe outputs.  \n“AI is evolving at a very fast pace, and it’s moving this fast without guard rails, without safety nets, without mechanism to prevent it from ever going off the rails,” Sakawa (pictured above) said. \nElloe AI is an API or an SDK, a module that sits on top of an AI model’s output layer, an “infrastructure on top of your LLM pipeline,” as Sakawa explained. “And it sits there basically fact-checking every single response.” \nThe startup’s system has its own layers, or “anchors,” as Sakawa put it.  \nThe first anchor fact-checks the LLMs response against verifiable sources. Then, the second anchor checks if the output violates any regulations, such as the U.S. health privacy law HIPAA, the European far-reaching data protection and privacy law GDPR, or if it exposes some Personal Private Information (PII). The last anchor is an audit trail that shows how all the previous decisions were made and allows regulators or anyone auditing the system “to analyze the train of thought for that model from where it made the decision the source of that decision, the confidence score of all those decisions,” according to Sakawa.  \nTo be clear, Sakawa said Elloe AI is not built on an LLM, because in his opinion, having LLMs checking other LLMs is just putting a “Band-Aid into another wound.” Elloe AI’s system does use AI techniques, though, such as machine learning. And there are humans in the loop: Elloe AI’s employees, who keep up with new regulations on data protection and user protection, Sakawa said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you want to learn more about Elloe AI — while also checking out dozens of other companies, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nVinod Khosla has a bold vision for how society could be reconfigured to share the abundance created by AI technology. Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Tuesday, the Khosla Ventures founder suggested the U.S. government could take a 10% stake in all public corporations and redistribute that corporate wealth to the public at large.\nAs Khosla put it, the idea was spurred by President Donald Trump’s decision for the U.S. government to purchase a 10% stake in Intel. “When Trump bought 10% of Intel, I wondered if it wasn’t a good idea,” Khosla said onstage at Disrupt. “Take 10% of every corporation and put it in a national pool for the people. That’s really interesting. Just take 10% of every public company.”\nAI leaders have explored universal basic income proposals in the past, most notably in OpenResearch’s extended study on cash payments, backed in part by Sam Altman. Still it’s rare for a prominent investor to so explicitly endorse a national stake in private industry. Khosla acknowledged the controversy onstage but said extreme proposals were necessary to sustain social cohesion through the disruption of artificial general intelligence.\n“I’ll get critique for this idea,” Khosla said. “But you know, sharing the wealth of AI is a really, really big need to level the benefits to everybody … We won’t need to do it in 15 years, but we do have to take care of those people. We will, by 2035, have a hugely, hugely deflationary economy.”\nKhosla also cautioned that the rise of AI would also displace jobs, which would require significant societal changes. For startup founders, this presents an opportunity to build, he said, noting that there’s a startup in building AI for every profession, like accounting, medicine, chip design, auditing, marketing, entertainment, and more.\nThe VC also suggested that the nature of work would change in the AI era, as the jobs that people perform today could go away. He pointed to work like mounting a tire on an assembly line or working as a farmer as “not a job that humans should have.”\n“That’s servitude to survival,” Khosla said.\nThere’s still plenty of time to get a ticket for TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, and with two days left, we’re offering a 50% discount.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

But for Express, Adobe has created a new mode that lets you use text prompts to create new images and designs. You can switch on the assistant mode to use AI prompts and then switch back to use editing tools and controls that are available in Express in the current version.\nMeanwhile, the new Photoshop assistant, which is in closed beta testing, lives in the sidebar. Adobe claims the assistant can understand different layers and help you automatically select objects and create masks. Adobe added that users can ask the assistant to complete repetitive tasks such as removing backgrounds or changing colors.\nImage Credits:Adobe\nAdobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, told TechCrunch that the company decided to build a different mode for its AI assistant in Express to target students and professionals who use the app. The company wants to see if users can achieve what they want to do without having to switch back to the traditional interface, he explained.\n“We think this approach of switching between two modes, where you get the best of both worlds, is gonna make the technology both accessible and controllable,” Costin said.\nThe company said it is also experimenting with a new type of assistant, dubbed “Project Moonlight,” that can coordinate with different assistants from other Adobe tools, and connect to a creator’s social channels to better understand their style.

    "body": "\nAmazon said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs as it seeks to reduce bureaucracy, remove layers, and invest more in its AI strategy.\nThis marks the e-commerce giant’s second-largest job cuts since it slashed 22,000 jobs in 2022. Amazon had nearly 1.2 million employees as of October 31, 2024, of which more than 360,000 were in its corporate division, in administrative, sales, and executive roles.\nIn a memo shared with employees, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote that the move is aimed at making the company “even stronger” by shifting resources to invest in its “biggest bets.”\nGaletti acknowledged that the decision would be questioned in light of the company’s good performance, but argued that the layoffs are necessary because the “world is changing quickly.”\n“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted [sic] that we need to be organized more leanly [sic], with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she wrote.\nThe layoffs come at a time when Amazon is investing heavily in tech infrastructure to build more compute capacity for offering AI services. \nIn June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to staff that the company would need fewer employees as it continues to roll out more AI agents. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat focus is clearly visible if you consider the company’s expenditure on tech infrastructure. Amazon said it had spent $55.6 billion in the first half of its current financial year primarily on tech infrastructure to support the growth of its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, according to its quarterly report.\nThe company’s revenue increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. AWS accounted for 18% of total net sales.\nReuters reported on Monday that the company was planning to slash up to 30,000 jobs across human resources, devices and services, operations, and other departments.\nThe company has made smaller job cuts across different divisions. In January, Amazon reduced a small number of positions in its Communications and Sustainability departments. \nAmazon said it is offering most affected employees 90 days to look for a new role internally, and its recruiters would prioritize internal candidates for new roles within the company. It will also offer severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more to those who can’t move internally.\nGaletti wrote that in 2026, the company would continue to remove layers and “realize efficiency gains” while hiring in key areas. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

The exec noted the company didn’t want to compete directly with apps like TikTok or other short-form drama apps, but did acknowledge there are more ways that Netflix can take advantage of the mobile platform.\nIn response to a question about the competitive landscape on mobile, Stone agreed there are times when consumers are looking for something Netflix offers, like a TV show, movie, or game, but there are other times they want “something more snackable.”\nIn these moments, Netflix needs to be able to offer “a broader variety of content,” she said. \n“We’re testing a vertical video feed on mobile devices that starts to reimagine what mobile is, and kind of meets consumers where they are now and how they’re using mobile today.”\nThat feed, announced earlier this year as a test, allows members to scroll through clips of its original titles. The goal is to encourage Netflix users to be inspired to watch the show or movie. \nHowever, the company may have bigger plans for how that feed can be utilized, Stone’s comments suggested. \nThe exec pointed to Moments, a video clipping feature in the Netflix app that lets users clip and share their favorite scenes from a show or movie. \nThere’s potential for seeding those short clips into the vertical video feed, but Stone didn’t directly confirm this plan. Instead, she said more vaguely the company would experiment with “different types of content” that could be in the vertical feed, as well as “different ways to clip and share content.”\n“We’ve been innovating on Moments, which allows kind of a social connection to some of the content by allowing a member to take a clip and share it with their networks,” she said. adding that the feature is a type of short-form experience. \n“But [Netflix” is not intending to copy or chase exactly what a TikTok or others are doing because we think that there’s a certain type of entertainment — or moment of truth — that’s especially valuable to our members, and we really want to be focused there, versus trying to be all things at every moment, which I don’t think needs to be a core part of the strategy,” Stone added.\nAnother experiment involves podcasts, thanks to Netflix’s recent deal with Spotify to distribute podcasts on its platform. \n“We’ll use some of these new canvases we have, like vertical video, to start to experiment with new content types — and that includes something we announced more recently, which is podcasts,” Stone added, noting that some podcast content would be co-exclusive across Netflix and Spotify and would come to life on both mobile and TV. \nThe exec said users will see these experiments will be out in the next few quarters and throughout 2026. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nNetflix CTO Elizabeth Stone announced at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that the streaming service is branching out into immersive and interactive experiences, starting with real-time voting. The move marks a new way for the streamer to boost engagement, as it allows audiences of live shows to interact in real time.\nViewers will be able to vote while watching live content to directly influence the outcome of what they’re watching on their TV or mobile device. \nThe streamer started testing real-time voting on its live cooking show “Dinner Time Live with David Chang” in August and will roll out the functionality to its reboot of “Star Search,” a talent competition series that has been off the air for 20 years and is being brought back by Netflix next year.\n“If you’re sitting at home watching ‘Star Search’ on your TV, you’ll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn’t advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone said on TechCrunch Disrupt’s main stage on Tuesday. “So it’s just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they’re part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”\nViewers will be prompted on-screen and have a limited amount of time to rate performances. If you rewind or aren’t caught up with the livestream, you may miss the voting window. \nImage Credits:Netflix\nOn “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” viewers were asked to vote on whether they prefer tuna fish or grilled cheese. In another instance, they were asked if they think soups are better than salads. Viewers can see the results of the voting displayed on-screen.\nNetflix says it saw consistent engagement episode to episode in early testing of real-time voting, which it believes signals strong potential for more interactive entertainment in the future. \nThe streaming service says it’s focused on building toward more ways for viewers to feel involved in what they’re watching, which is why it’s working to allow for real-time responsiveness to content. At a time when Netflix is facing mounting competition from other streaming services, the company likely hopes that its new interactive functionality will create a shared, community-driven viewing experience for its members.\nIt’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time Netflix has explored real-time voting with its content, as the streaming service previously tested interactive viewer polls during its reality TV shows “Too Hot to Handle” and “Love Is Blind.”\nIn addition to Live, Netflix is focused on real-time responsiveness for formats like its new Party Games for TV, and, eventually, podcasts, so users can engage with what is happening in the moment.\n“There’s also a lot that’s exciting happening with cloud games, which introduces another similar kind of interaction pattern,” Stone said. “So we’ve got some fun living room party games launching in Q4 this year, more next year — for example, Boggle. So it’s on your living room TV screen. You’re able to do it with friends and family locally using your mobile phone. It’s another way to think about more immersive, fun, in-the-moment content, in addition to the more traditional film and TV, which, of course, we’ll continue to hit out of the park.”\nAlso on Tuesday, Stone announced that Netflix is launching immersive experiences on its homepage that the company says will bring its content to life through animation and dynamic special effects. To start, Netflix has launched a new Halloween Collection immersive experience. In the future, the company will debut a Holiday Collection in December and more IP-driven ones in the future, such as a “Bridgerton” one.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nVram Ismailyan spent nearly 14 years at Wells Fargo, selling payment infrastructure strategies to Fortune 500 companies.  Despite being a top performer in the payments division, he felt constantly bogged down by the bank’s antiquated technology.\n“I spent at least five to 10 hours preparing for customer meetings,” he told TechCrunch. “I had to work through 10 or 15 different systems to gather information, make sense of it, and then put it into a PowerPoint.”\nLike his colleague, Kevin Miyamoto also struggled with Wells Fargo’s tech. Despite managing $900 billion in annual client payments, he managed his entire portfolio of accounts with Excel spreadsheets instead of a proper CRM.\nFrustrated by the inefficient tech tools at Wells Fargo, Ismailyan and Miyamoto teamed up in 2021 to build Identifee, a software platform designed specifically for commercial bankers with all the capabilities they wished they had. The company is a Top 20 finalist in the Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nBecause they had personally grappled with outdated tech at one of the nation’s largest banks, Ismailyan and Miyamoto recognized that the tech inefficiencies are even more severe at smaller financial institutions.\n“If you want to pull any information on your customer, you might have to log in to 10 separate systems, download the data that’s all different into Excel, to then start to do analysis,” Miyamoto said. “It takes forever.”\nIdentifee is designed to boost banker productivity by combining the functionality of multiple, fragmented internal systems into a single platform.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe startup’s platform is built on several modular systems that clients can purchase individually or as a complete suite. These systems include a CRM, a business intelligence tool for tracking customer data, and a sales enablement module for generating reports and presentations.\n“If you’re a community bank, you could do what Identifee does, but you’d have to get Salesforce, Seismic, Power BI, and Tableau,” Miyamoto said. “Or you could use our tool, which has all those things, but in one easy platform.”\nSome of Identifee’s modules are also powered by AI. For instance, the startup’s AI agent can help fill out request for proposals (RFP) forms in accordance with each bank’s compliance and risk policies.\nIsmailyan and Miyamoto claim Identifee is the only platform built specifically for commercial banks and credit unions, a combined U.S. market segment estimated to exceed 8,800 institutions.\nIdentifee has already won the trust of the banking sector, signing up over 170 clients, including major names like Silicon Valley Bank, First Fidelity Bank, and Comerica.\nThe company has raised about $5 million in seed funding from investors including Ocean Azul Partners, 10X Capital, and Gaingels.\nWhen asked why other startups aren’t tackling commercial banking tech inefficiencies, Miyamoto responded: “There are tons of people familiar with [this problem], but those people don’t start companies like Vram and I did.”\nIf you want to learn more about Identifee from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nAuston Bunsen had a lot of free time after his company QuickNode reached a certain size. That company, a blockchain developer platform, was founded in 2017 and subsequently raised more than $100 million in funding, according to PitchBook.  \nThen Bunsen started thinking about the fact that people would perhaps like to unlock their doors with their iPhone. “I eventually met with some folks at Apple and they decided to make a bet that I could help further their goals to enable every company to bring the power of Apple Wallet to their door,” Bunsen told TechCrunch.  \nBunsen left QuickNode last October and decided to work on his new idea: AccessGrid, which builds APIs that companies can use to manage digital key fobs directly within Apple and Google’s wallet platforms. \n“It works when your iPhone is locked, syncs automatically to your watch, and, in the case of iPhone, works even if your phone is dead,” Bunsen said. The company officially launched in April, and on Tuesday, announced a $4.4 million seed round led by Harlem Capital.  \nRight now, Bunsen said, the access control industry is stuck in the late 1990s. Many systems must operate on-premises and are disconnected from the cloud, or use unencrypted communications and ID card technologies that are easily hackable.  \n“AccessGrid replaces that with an API that issues uncloneable credentials using encrypted payloads that can be instantly revoked via the cloud,” Bunsen said. “We think it’s time to bring physical security systems up to 2025 standards.”\nCybersecurity is a big concern for a product like this, but Bunsen says the company uses “military-grade” encryption as well as dual-encryption. “We use multi-factor authentication for all server access, and other standard cybersecurity practices,” he continued.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBunsen is building this product alone, unlike when he built QuickNode with three other co-founders, and described his fundraising journey as a “distraction.” \n“Serving customers is our purpose, so anything that is not that is a distraction for us,” he said.\nStill, Bunsen met Henri Pierre-Jacques, the managing partner at Harlem Capital, through some friends in Miami. Other investors in the round came from Bunsen’s time at QuickNode, such as Marell Evans from Exceptional Capital, and Maya Bakhai from Spice Capital. AccessGrid also took part in the HF0 accelerator and received its first check from the program.  \nAccessGrid is going up against other startups in this space, including SwiftConnect and Sharry. But Bunsen says his startup is different because it does not sell service contracts or middle-ware to talk to existing hardware devices. “We are a ‘pure play’, API-only,” Bunsen said, adding that it’s a developer platform, not an end-user app with API features.  \nThe fresh capital will be used to continue building the app’s security, as well as for new products and features. The company hopes to expand into automobile products soon.  \nEventually, Bunsen wants to upgrade every access control reader in the U.S. “Our hope is to create a world where everything you normally need a key for opens just because you’re nearby,” he said. “You’ll never lose your key because it’s always with you. We want to make getting into the places you belong faster, safer, and more seamless, for people and machines alike.”  \nThis piece was updated to reflect how much QuickNode had raised. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI on Tuesday said it had completed its recapitalization, splitting the AI lab into a for-profit corporation nested inside a non-profit foundation. It’s the end result of a complex legal process that had been strenuously resisted by its estranged co-founder, Elon Musk.\nUnder the new structure, the non-profit OpenAI Foundation will have legal control over a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group, which is free to raise funding or acquire companies without legal restraint. The Foundation will hold a significant stake in OpenAI Group and will appoint its board of directors.\n“We believe that the world’s most powerful technology must be developed in a way that reflects the world’s collective interests,” OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor wrote in a blog post. “The close of our recapitalization gives us the ability to keep pushing the frontier of AI, and an updated corporate structure to ensure progress serves everyone.”\nUnder the new structure, the OpenAI Foundation will own 26% of the for-profit, with a warrant for additional shares to be granted if the company continues to grow. Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, will hold a roughly 27% stake, valued at about $135 billion, with the remaining 47% held by investors and employees.\nAccording to a separate blog post by Microsoft, the deal will also extend Microsoft’s IP rights to OpenAI models through 2032. If OpenAI ever declares that it has achieved its long-held goal of artificial general intelligence, the deal will also require it to submit to an independent expert panel for verification.\nPrior to this recapitalization, OpenAI was operating as a non-profit under strict equity restrictions — a position that became increasingly untenable as the company’s fundraising became more ambitious. In April, SoftBank announced an unprecedented $30 billion investment into OpenAI, contingent on the company’s successful conversion into a for-profit. On Saturday, The Information reported that the final installment of the funding had been sent, signaling a possible breakthrough in the restructuring.\nThere have been a number of legal efforts to block or otherwise influence the restructuring, most notably from Elon Musk, who at one point offered to acquire the company for $97.4 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe attorneys general from California and Delaware, who had raised concerns about the conversion, will allow the process to proceed, subject to further conditions published by both offices. Notably, the California agreement requires OpenAI to “continue to undertake measures to mitigate risks to teens and others inconnection with the development and deployment of AI and of AGI.”\nIn the announcement post, Taylor cited discussions with the state offices as a positive influence on the process. “We made several changes as a result of those discussions and we believe OpenAI—and as a result, the public we serve—are better for them,” Taylor wrote. \nIn the wake of the news, CEO Sam Altman announced an open livestream with chief scientist Jakub Pachocki to answer questions from the public. The event will begin at 10:30 a.m. Pacific Time.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nIt happened one day.  \nJannae Gammage was working with the Small Business Administration as a technology consultant, helping companies get access to capital through traditional lenders, like banks and credit unions. She couldn’t stop thinking, however, that there was a problem: The ways in which lenders and businesses connected were woefully outdated, especially on the technological front.  \n“I was inside the mess, watching good businesses die, while trying to navigate legacy workflows,” she told TechCrunch. “My literal job was to find technology to solve this, and it didn’t exist. I couldn’t find anything.”  \nSo she called up an old friend, Alaia Martin, and the two got to work. In 2022, the duo started working on Cyphr, a Kansas City-based company focused on making the lending process easier for lenders and small businesses. Cyphr is a Top 20 finalist in Startup Battlefield, part of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nThe product analyzes alternative data sources and financial patterns of small businesses to help lenders make decisions about small business creditworthiness. Cyphr went through a few iterations since its launch, but the recent advancements in artificial intelligence paved the way for what the product is today. It officially launched in the market in April 2024.  \n“When we started out, the problem we were trying to solve was, ‘How can we make underwriting smarter, faster, so that these entrepreneurs get access to capital?’” Gammage, CEO, said. “We wanted a world where money moved freely like it did in other verticals. We came in with a borrower-centric experience, whereas a lot of companies were focused on ‘how do we make this work for lenders.’” \nThey started building an LLM, using training data based on overlooked business owners and their company’s financials, to help lenders make decisions about which companies to partner with.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We were doing it manually,” Martin, the company’s COO, said about building LLMs before AI’s latest upgrade. “Even though we’re an AI native company, we started doing this without really any help.”  \nTheir current model is on top of an OpenAI model, which they’ve fine-tuned for themselves. \nThe latest updates in AI, however, did more than boost their product — it also made lenders more willing to work with them, Gammage said. The financial industry was already shifting because of COVID, knowing they needed to digitize and modernize in some ways. “Now you add in this AI, where they’re using it on a daily basis, it feels comfortable,” she said.  \n“If we had [gone to market] in 2022, it definitely would have been a lot harder to get buy-in, just because of the fear around technology and AI and the status quo,” Gammage said.  \nThe company has raised a million dollars to date. Gammage said the process was easy and hard at the same time.  \n“The things I thought would be hard were not hard. The things I thought would be pretty straightforward were not at all,” she said.  One sore point was how capital flowed: They would watch peers raise millions at once, whereas for them, the money came in tranches as they partook in accelerators and various pitch competitions.  \n“It’s very hard to have catalytic moments when you’re receiving your cash injections that way,” she said.  \nMartin, meanwhile, was worried about what it would be like fundraising in San Francisco as two Black women with non-technical backgrounds from the Midwest. “We are not what you think of when you think of a tech founder,” she said. But she said they didn’t have much of a problem. “We were really well received in Silicon Valley.”  \n“I’m so grateful we were able to raise because I know it’s less than 1% of us that can say that,” Gammage added.  \nThe company has big plans: It’s currently building a platform to help companies find opportunities when the World Cup comes to town next year. Gammage and Martin have also thought about new locations for the company, though nothing is set in stone.  \n“We are excited about the future of the company,” Gammage said, adding that winning Disrupt’s Battlefield will hopefully help accomplish these goals. “Even momentum requires money.”  \nIf you want to learn more about Cyphr from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

On a MacBook, navigating to an app’s iOS store page in the browser would prompt the native App Store software to launch. But on non-Apple hardware, this would lead you to a dead end.\nThe new interface allows users to browse apps by category and by platform — there are separate sections for apps on the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and other devices. While users cannot currently download apps from the web, this functionality could possibly be added in later.\nAdmittedly, the subset of people who are trying to learn more about iOS apps from a Microsoft device, for example, is likely a small one — perhaps this would be useful to app developers or researchers working on products in both the iOS and Google ecosystems.\nThis redesign also signifies Apple’s continued push to portray itself as a more open ecosystem. For years, governments around the world have lodged complaints against Apple, accusing the company of acting as a monopoly to discourage competition — any step Apple takes to make its products more accessible beyond its own ecosystem is relevant to those ongoing legal battles.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

The company said that past content will remain private after the conversion, and member lists will remain protected.\nOften, admins start their groups as private, thinking they will remain small, but then realize they could reach a much broader audience if they were easier to find. This update will allow Facebook Groups to expand their reach without having to start a public group from scratch or exposing their members’ past posts.\nAccording to Meta, the change to the group’s privacy can be made from the settings page on Facebook. When an admin changes the private group’s status to public, all other admins are notified of the change and have a three-day window to review and cancel the conversion if not everyone agrees.\nImage Credits:Meta/Facebook\nAfter the update, all past group content — including posts, comments, and reactions — will only be visible to members who were in the group before the conversion, as well as to admins and moderators. Member lists are also protected and only visible to admins and moderators.\nMembers are also notified about the change and will be reminded again when they post or comment for the first time in the newly public group.\nAfter the conversion to public, new posts, comments, and reactions will be visible to anyone, including those who aren’t on Facebook, as with any other public group. This could also help Facebook’s content be more easily indexed by search engines like Google, which can then surface these groups in their search results for related queries.\nIf the admins decide that being a public group isn’t the right call, they can revert the group to private again.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n"

    "body": "\nAmazon announced on Tuesday that Alexa+, its upgraded assistant powered by AI, is coming to the Amazon Music app for iOS and Android devices. \nThe feature is currently available across all Amazon Music subscription plans, but is only available for users with Alexa+ Early Access. (To access Alexa+, tap the “a” button in the lower right corner and ask your question using the built-in microphone on your phone. ) \nThe introduction of Alexa+ to Amazon Music aims to create a more conversational approach to music discovery. Unlike the previous version of Alexa, which only responded to basic commands, Alexa+ is designed to engage in natural dialogue. \nUsers can ask specific and obscure questions, such as queries regarding an artist’s influences or exploring deeper meanings behind songs. It can also help recall a song’s title by providing lyrics you remember or even mentioning the movie it was featured in.\nAdditionally, Alexa+ can create personalized playlists tailored to specific requests, such as “Make a playlist of 2010s hits that keep me moving fast, starting with a track from Nicki Minaj,” the company suggested. \nSome other examples the company provided include: “Can you recommend new music that would make me seem cool to my 13-year-old daughter without trying too hard?” and “What’s the song that plays during the opening credits of ‘The Sopranos’?”\nImage Credits:Amazon Music\nAlexa+ was initially announced in February at the company’s hardware event and is positioned as one of the first consumer-focused agent tools on the market. This assistant can perform actions on a user’s behalf, such as booking restaurant reservations and ordering groceries.\nWhile Alexa+ is still in its early stages and not yet widely available to the public, it has already rolled out to more than a million users.\nThe company reported that Amazon Music listeners who have tried the feature are exploring songs three times more with Alexa+ than with the original assistant, and those seeking recommendations are listening to nearly 70% more music.\nIn light of Spotify’s recent integration with ChatGPT, this could be a strategic move by Amazon to compete with the music streaming giant and showcase its own AI investments. Amazon Music has already incorporated numerous AI features into its app, with the latest additions being weekly AI-generated playlists, AI-assisted search, and “Explore,” which helps users learn more about their favorite artists.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

Additionally, you will see clearer images and stickers.\nThe Meta-owned messaging app notes that, as always, your personal messages and calls are protected with end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp also says that it plans to deliver even more functionality to Apple Watches in the future.\nThe new WhatsApp Apple Watch app requires an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, running watchOS 10 or later.\nTuesday’s announcement doesn’t come as a total surprise, as WhatsApp was spotted testing the new Apple Watch app last week.\nWhatsApp has been working to make it easier for users to access its service beyond mobile and desktop. In May, WhatsApp debuted its long-awaited iPad app, which allows you to make video and audio calls with up to 32 people, share your screen, and use both front and rear cameras. Before the launch of the app, if you wanted to use WhatsApp on your iPad, you had to use the web version in a browser.\nWhatsApp’s launch of an Apple Watch app comes a few months after Snapchat rolled out one as well. The app allows users to preview an incoming message and also reply using the keyboard, Scribble, Dictation, or an emoji. Snapchat is focused on using its watchOS app to enable users to quickly respond to messages, not to view images or videos.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoFundMe has introduced a new offering that allows you to purchase digital gift cards for your loved ones, enabling them to donate to their favorite nonprofit organizations during the holidays. \nThe gift cards start at $5 and come in a variety of themes and causes, including Birthday, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Ramadan, as well as cards for animal lovers, cancer fighters, and nature protectors.\nThese cards work differently than traditional gift cards, though. They operate through Giving Funds, GoFundMe’s fee-free donor-advised fund (DAF). Launched in June, this marked the platform’s first entry into DAFs, aiming to make them accessible to everyday donors. Historically, donor-advised funds have been out of reach for most people due to high minimum contributions and fees.\nWhen recipients claim the gift card, the amount is deposited into their personal Giving Fund. They then have the option to donate immediately or allow the funds to grow tax-free in their account, which gives them the opportunity to contribute even more later. The person who purchased the gift card receives a tax deduction.\nRecipients can choose from 1.4 million nonprofits on the platform, ranging from local food banks to global organizations that provide disaster relief, support youth programs, and promote animal welfare.\nImage Credits:GoFundMe\nGoFundMe’s new gifting strategy could appeal to users for several reasons. For example, instead of giving a generic gift, people can help their loved ones support causes that truly matter to them, such as a local soup kitchen that helps feed families during Thanksgiving, a time when many people struggle to put a meal on the table.\nPlus, a nonprofit gift card can also be a great way for older generations to teach younger family members about the importance of giving back. It opens up conversations about different causes and the real impact they have.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn May, GoFundMe celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced that it had surpassed $40 billion raised globally.

    "body": "\nNvidia is playing fast and loose with its war chest as it looks to build on its momentum as the chief benefactor of the AI boom. \nThe company on Tuesday signed a €1 billion ($1.15 billion) partnership with Deutsche Telekom to set up an “AI factory” in Munich that aims to boost Germany’s AI computing power by 50%.\nCalled the “Industrial AI Cloud,” the project will use more than 1,000 Nvidia DGX B200 systems and RTX Pro Servers with up to 10,000 Blackwell GPUs to provide AI inferencing and other services to German companies while complying with German data sovereignty laws.\nDeutsche Telecom said early partners of the project include Agile Robots, whose bots will be used to install server racks at the facility, and Perplexity, which will use the data center to provide “in-country” AI inferencing to German users and companies. The telco also outlined digital twins and physics-based simulation as use cases for industrial companies.\nThe telecom company said it would provide the physical infrastructure for the project, while SAP will provide its Business Technology platform and applications. \nThe partnership comes at a time when the European tech industry has been calling on EU lawmakers to reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and service providers, and foster adoption of homegrown alternatives. At the same time, tech companies have been criticizing the bloc’s approach to regulating AI, arguing that the rules only serve to hold back innovation. \nThe EU earlier this year committed €200 billion to set up “AI gigafactories” on the continent, focusing on “industrial and mission-critical applications.” But funding for AI initiatives in the European Union has been notably lower than in the U.S., where companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle have pumped in hundreds of billions to build massive data centers and assorted infrastructure to support development of AI models and services.\nDeutsche Telekom noted that this project, expected to start operations in early 2026, is separate from the EU’s AI gigafactory initiative.\n“Mechanical engineering and industry have made this country strong,” says Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom. “But here, too, we are challenged. AI is a huge opportunity. It will help to improve our products and strengthen our European strengths.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nApple’s latest iOS update, available for eligible devices from Monday, doesn’t introduce any major features, but it does bring one highly-requested tweak: the ability to change the transparency of the translucent liquid glass design.\nIf you didn’t like the look of iOS 26, all you could do so far was to reduce transparency via the accessibility settings, which pretty much turned off the liquid glass overlay. With iOS 26.1, we now get a new menu to retain the look while increasing opacity.\nYou can head to Settings > Display & Brightness > Liquid Glass to select either the original “Clear” option or a more opaque “Tinted” option. You can also see a preview of each option when you’re selecting them.\nLiquid glass was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move to a flat design back in 2013, but similar to most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome people said the more translucent design made various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps, while others professed their love for the attention to detail and the new look, which felt like a much-needed update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nImage Credits: Screenshot by TechCrunch\nBesides the transparency settings, iOS 26.1 also lets you tweak what gestures do on the home screen: You now get an option to open the camera app by swiping to the left on the lockscreen. You change this by going to Settings > Camera > Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera.\nIOS 26.1 also gives users the ability to locally capture audio and video while recording a video call. This can be useful if you’re recording a call or podcast on the move.

Some of these GPUs will be Nvidia GB300 NVL72 systems, which were announced earlier this year and began shipping in the last few months.\n“It’s great to watch the Microsoft and Lambda teams working together to deploy these massive AI supercomputers,” said Stephen Balaban, CEO of Lambda, in the company’s press release. “We’ve been working with Microsoft for more than eight years, and this is a phenomenal next step in our relationship.”\nMicrosoft opened its first Nvidia GB300 NVL72 cluster in October.\nCompanies like Lambda, which was founded years before the current AI boom in 2012 and has raised $1.7 billion in venture dollars, are seeing strong demand as companies continue to gobble up AI infrastructure and compute.\nThis announcement comes just hours after Microsoft announced a $9.7 billion deal for AI cloud capacity with IREN, an Australian data center business.\nEarlier today, OpenAI announced that it had struck a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon to buy cloud services over the next seven years.

    "body": "\nLawmakers have called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Flock Safety, a company that operates license plate-scanning cameras, for allegedly failing to implement cybersecurity protections that expose its camera network to hackers and spies.\nIn a letter sent by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL, 8th), the lawmakers urge FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson to probe why Flock does not enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security protection that prevents malicious access by someone with knowledge of the account holder’s password.\nWyden and Krishnamoorthi said that while the company offers its law enforcement customers the ability to enable MFA, “Flock does not require it, which the company confirmed to Congress in October,” according to the letter.\nWyden and Krishnamoorthi said that if hackers or foreign spies learn of a law enforcement user’s password, “they can gain access to law-enforcement-only areas of Flock’s website and search the billions of photos of Americans’ license plates collected by taxpayer-funded cameras across the country.”\nFlock operates one of the largest networks of cameras and license plate readers in the U.S., providing access to more than 5,000 police departments, as well as private businesses, across the country. Flock’s cameras scan the license plates of passing vehicles so that police and federal agencies with logins to Flock’s platform can search the billions of captured photos and track where vehicles have traveled at any given time.\nThe lawmakers said that they had found evidence that some of Flock’s law enforcement customers’ logins had been previously stolen and shared online, citing data from Hudson Rock, a cybersecurity company that identifies usernames and passwords stolen by information-stealing malware. \nIndependent security researcher Benn Jordan also provided the lawmakers with a screenshot showing a Russian cybercrime forum allegedly selling access to Flock logins.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch for comment, Flock shared the company’s response in a letter from its chief legal officer Dan Haley, in which he says the company switched on MFA by default for all new customers starting in November 2024 and that 97% of its law enforcement customers have enabled MFA to date.\nThat leaves around 3% of the company’s customers — potentially dozens of law enforcement agencies — that have declined to switch on MFA, citing “reasons specific to them,” Haley wrote. \nHolly Beilin, a spokesperson for Flock, did not immediately provide a specific number of law enforcement customers that have not yet switched on MFA, nor did she say if any federal agencies are among the remaining customers, or for what reason Flock does not require its customers to switch on the security feature.\nAs previously reported by 404 Media, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration used a local police officer’s password to access Flock’s cameras to search for an individual suspected of an “immigration violation,” but without the officer’s knowledge. The Palos Heights Police Department said it switched on multi-factor authentication following the breach.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The gang then takes a cut of the profits made from any ransom payments.\nAccording to an FBI affidavit filed in September, the rogue employees received more than $1.2 million in ransom payments from one victim, a medical device maker in Florida. They also targeted several other companies, including a Virginia-based drone maker and a Maryland-headquartered pharmaceutical company. \nThe Chicago Sun-Times first reported the indictment on Sunday.\nSygnia chief executive Guy Segal confirmed to TechCrunch that Goldberg was a Sygnia employee and was terminated after Sygnia learned of his alleged involvement with the ransomware attacks. The company declined to comment further, citing the FBI’s ongoing investigation.\nDigitalMint president Marc Grens told TechCrunch that Martin was an employee at the time of the alleged hacks but said Martin was “acting completely outside the scope of his employment.” \nGrens also confirmed that the unnamed individual may be a former employee.

    "body": "\nWhen we gather ’round the proverbial fire and exchange our online dating war stories, we’re usually talking about the usual suspects: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Grindr, and sometimes more niche apps like Lex. But ever since Facebook Dating launched in 2019, I’m not sure I have ever heard a tale that began there — I know more people who met in Facebook meme groups than on the actual Facebook Dating product.\nTurns out my anecdotal data may be wrong — because people actually do use Facebook Dating! Meta shared user metrics for the first time on Monday, revealing that Facebook Dating has 21.5 million daily active users (DAUs) across 52 countries.\nFacebook Dating is a feature within Facebook, rather than a standalone app, and Facebook puts its dating product front and center in the main bottom navigation bar on the app. (Even if your relationship status is not set to single, Facebook Dating remains in its prominent spot.)\nWhat’s most surprising, though, is how Facebook Dating seems to be slowly catching on among young people. The platform counts 1.77 million users between the ages of 18-29 in the U.S., which is still not quite up to par with the “usual suspects,” but it’s getting closer. App analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that as of this summer in the U.S., Tinder had 7.3 million active users across all age groups; Hinge had 4.4 million; Bumble had 3.6 million; and Grindr had 2.2 million.\nFacebook has publicly addressed the fact that it struggles to keep Gen Z and young millennials on the platform, yet the company said last year that daily conversations on Facebook Dating in the 18-29 demographic spiked 24%.\nFacebook Dating’s best feature is not something it actively does, but rather, it’s what Facebook Dating doesn’t do. Unlike Hinge, you don’t have to pay to “unlock” your most desirable matches or buy other premium features that supposedly bring you closer to finding “the one.”\nHinge debuted its “Standouts” feature in December 2020, which has become symbolic of everything wrong with dating apps. Hinge’s algorithm finds the people whom it thinks you will be most interested in, then places them in their own elite tab of the app. The only way to swipe right on these people is to give them a “rose,” which users get for free once a week — unless you buy more roses for $4 a pop. Even if you buy roses, your maybe-possibly future husband will know you used a precious rose on him, which is kind of embarrassing. So, like a true star-crossed-lovers situation, some users have devised increasingly complex schemes to trick the Hinge algorithm into freeing these people from “rose jail.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy comparison, Facebook Dating’s free model looks pretty good. It’s not that Mark Zuckerberg is a benevolent Silicon Valley cupid — Meta is already making bank off of you by relentlessly collecting your data, so it doesn’t need you to buy roses. But as users grow more aggrieved with their usual rotation of apps, Facebook Dating may not seem so cringe anymore.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nClickUp has redesigned its productivity platform and released new AI assistant features as it aims to create a one-stop shop for customers. \nThe company said core parts of this release were possible because of its acquisition of Qatalog, the enterprise search startup that had raised  more than $29.5 million from backers like Salesforce Ventures, Atomico, Prototype Capital, Mosaic Ventures, Tiny VC, and Possible Ventures.\nClickUp is launching two types of AI agents with its 4.0 release. The first one is an agent that is present in all communication channels. The agent is designed to proactively look for questions people might have asked and try to answer them using knowledge stored in within the company and external sources like Google Drive, OneDrive, Figma, and Gmail. \nImage Credits: ClickUpImage Credits:ClickUp\nThe other assistant, called Brain, is a more general-purpose assistant that can generate ideas, perform tasks like scheduling a meeting based on the availability of teammates as well as add a comment under a task, or create a new one. It can also access the web and other integrated tools, analyze reports, and create drafts. Just like many other AI assistants, Brain also lives in the sidebar and is accessible anywhere on the ClickUp interface.\nThe a16z-backed productivity company said the new release is making it easier for users to switch between tasks, docs, and communications. ClickUp 4.0 lets you look at your internal company forum timeline, switch between different communication channels, and look at your tasks through options in the sidebar.\nClickUp has been trying to better compete with the likes of Notion, Slack, and Microsoft Teams by providing calendar, communication, and documents, enterprise search, and task tracking under one product.\nThe startup has tried to make its communication have feature parity with the likes of Slack and Teams. It launched AI-powered summaries and internal live video and audio calls called Syncups last year. Now it is placing a Syncup button in every channel and also allowing its AI notetaker to record these live video calls, transcribe them, and send notes to everyone.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credit: Clickup\nThe company’s calendar tool can now look at your meeting spread and automatically adjust meetings and tasks if you mark a certain task as a priority. ClickUp also displays an internet-style team dashboard where leaders can see various updates from different channels, look at team analytics on work progress, and check who has time off this week.\n“Eight years ago, when we started, the vision and the strategy were to replace all of your work software. The strategy to do that was to build a flexible data models platform that can be used essentially for anything, and build primitives of software like a spreadsheet, a table, a document, and a task,” ClickUp CEO Zeb Evans told TechCrunch over a call. “In the age of AI, they’re needed to an even greater extent because you can’t really visualize things in AI within a chat interface.”\nEvans said ClickUp has had great momentum in the last few years and has crossed $300 million in annual recurring revenue. He noted that with this growth rate, the company plans to go public within two years. ClickUp has raised more than $537 million in funding to date from investors like a16z, Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, and Lightspeed, according to Crunchbase data.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAndreessen Horowitz is pausing its Talent x Opportunity (TxO) fund and program, according to four sources familiar with the matter, including more than one founder in the program. \nThe firm announced TxO in 2020 to support founders who do not have access to traditional venture networks. Many of TxO’s participants were women and minorities who, overall, receive very slim amounts of venture capital dollars. \nThe announcement of the fund came during the wave of support that underrepresented founders received in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. The fund launched with $2.2 million in initial commitments, TechCrunch previously reported, with a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz and his wife, Felicia, matching up to an additional $5 million.\nTxO provided founders with access to tech networks, a 16-week-long training program, and a $175,000 investment through a donor-advised fund managed by the nonprofit Tides Foundation. The program went on to support more than 60 companies (like the media brand Brown Girl Magazine, food tech Myles Comfort Foods, and the maternity tech Villie).  \nTxO garnered some criticism when it launched because it’s technically structured as more of a nonprofit, rather than a traditional investment fund. Those investing in the fund are considered donors, and the money given is regarded as charity donations, rather than traditional limited partner investments.\nStill, founders who participated in the program and spoke to TechCrunch said it provided them with invaluable support and opportunities to which they otherwise would not have access. Last year, TxO expanded to launch a grant program, providing $50,000 to three tech nonprofits that support underserved founders. \nTxO announced its — as of now — last cohort of the program in early March 2025. Founders who partook in the program received an email on October 16 from Kofi Ampadu, the partner at a16z who led TxO, announcing the program would pause. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“When we launched TxO, the mission was clear: support talented, determined builders who are creating culture-shaping companies but may not have access to typical Silicon Valley networks and resources,” Ampadu’s email read, as seen by TechCrunch. “While that purpose has not changed, we are pausing our existing program to refine how we deliver on it.”\nThe rest of the email read:  \n\nOver the past five years, we’ve experimented with different models for best serving founders — from virtual and in-person programming to curriculum design and funding structure. As we rethink what’s next, we’ll be applying everything we’ve learned and evolving how we support founders by integrating with a16z’s broader early-stage investing and company building strategy.  \nTxO has backed more than 60 companies and nearly 100 founders. You have collectively raised tens of millions in follow-on capital and reached customers across culture and lifestyle. Founders from earlier cohorts now advise newer ones, and that peer support has strengthened the entire community.  \nThank you for being at the center of this community. Your progress is proof of what is possible. Stay tuned for what comes next. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly. \nBest regards, \nKofi \n\nA16z confirmed to TechCrunch that the program was shutting down and that Ampadu alerted participants via email.\nMembers of the TxO staff team, which had at least three people, excluding Ampadu, were also let go, according to two sources, with the end of October being their last week. \nThe fund’s application documents did not specifically call for founder diversity, except in terms of “cultural authenticity,” and also emphasized classic startup investment criteria like size of the market and ability to execute.  But the announcement of the fund back in 2020 made clear it was “for entrepreneurs who did not have access to the fast track in life but who have great potential. Their products can be non-tech or tech; they should be from underserved communities (all backgrounds welcome).”\nStill, many in the startup world perceived TxO as an accelerator for diverse talent, and several people who spoke to TechCrunch pointed out that its hiatus comes as top names in tech eliminate, cut, reframe, or completely walk back on prior public commitments related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Trump administration has threatened legal and political ramifications for businesses supporting anything that could be seen as DEI. \nOthers, however, noted that a16z is still interested in accelerator-type startup programs. Earlier this year, it launched Speedrun, a program that promises cohort grads up to $1 million of investment.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLocket, a private social networking app for friends, has scored a win with Gen Alpha users following the launch of its latest feature, Rollcall.\nThe app, which lets friends share photos that then appear in home screen widgets, first hit the top of the App Store’s charts in early 2022 by taking advantage of Apple’s widget system to form the basis of its social network. Instead of updates sent via push notifications, the app’s widget would update to show your friends’ newly posted photos. This, in turn, would drive engagement back in the app, prompting users to share their own photos in return.\nLocket’s Rollcall feature takes a similar approach by turning Apple platform features into social networking tools, CEO Matt Moss explains. A former Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) student scholarship winner, Moss understands that new formats can help attract users and draw people in.\nRollcall prompts users to share their favorite photos from the past week, and it leverages an iOS feature called Live Activities. This allows the app to utilize the iPhone Lock Screen to capture users’ attention. Introduced in iOS 18, Live Activities allow iOS apps to offer frequent information updates in glanceable locations like the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island (the black bar at the top of the screen).\nApple originally envisioned Live Activities as a way for apps with real-time information to update their users — for instance, with information about their Uber arriving or pizza delivery. However, some apps have used the technology in unique ways, like adding a virtual pet that frolics in the Dynamic Island, or displaying the real-time lyrics for the song you’re listening to right on your Lock Screen.\nFor Locket, however, Live Activities becomes the modern-day version of the push notification.\n“Every Sunday, we’ll take over your Lock Screen and you’ll get this nice Live Activity that pops up right on the homepage of the iPhone,” said Moss. “It’s similar to the widget [as it’s] using Apple technology to get in front of people and then let you share those moments that you wouldn’t have shared,” he told TechCrunch in an interview in the halls of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference last week. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThe use of the technology in this way has already proved successful for Locket, which has north of 91 million lifetime installs across iOS and Android, per Appfigures estimates. In Rollcall’s first week, Locket saw over a million shares driven by the feature, the company said.\nIn addition, Moss said that well over 25% of the app’s active users are now posting a Rollcall every week. \n“The Live Activity pulls people in a lot more,” Moss said. “And it’s fun, because as your friends are sharing, they’ll feel like we’re all doing this together.” \nRoughly 80% of Rollcall’s initial active users were classified as Gen Alpha.\nThe founder noted there are some differences between how Gen Alpha and Gen Z use Locket. \n“I think the big difference is … [being] the companion piece versus the primary. We have so many more users now [for whom] Locket is like their main way of connecting with their friends, Moss explained. “Sending photos directly. Sharing photos with 10 or 20 of their best friends. I think that’s been a big difference for us,” he added.\nImage Credits:Locket\nWith Rollcall gaining traction out of the gate, the company is now exploring how to use the feature as a launching pad for other experiences beyond photos. For instance, Moss says adding video support is an obvious next step, but he’s also thinking about how to incorporate things like music, favorite places you visited, or prompts designed to help you remember things that happened during the week.\nWhile Locket doesn’t have plans to support AI-generated photos or videos, like Sora or Meta AI, the company is considering how AI could be used in other ways — like making collages or pulling together photo memories.\n“Even though those things may use up a lot of attention,” Moss said, referring to AI apps, “there’s something so fundamental and basic about communicating and connecting with real people in the world. There will always be a role for that, and there will always be a demand that people have.” \nThe company is also thinking about how Locket can transform users’ virtual connections with friends into more real-world touchpoints — even if it’s something as simple as reminding users to call or text a friend. \n“I think for us, it’s always much more like: how can we use those things to actually, genuinely help people connect, versus it just being a kind of short-term fun experience, and you know, [that] might actually be a huge strength in the long run — being that place where it is just the people you actually know,” Moss said. \nLocket today monetizes via a subscription and says it has more than 100,000 subscribers. As a result, the 15-person company has been profitable since last year.\n"

The total project pipeline is worth $8.5 billion, the governments said.\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. Department of Defense will also invest in a gallium refinery in Western Australia capable of producing 100 tons per year. Currently, the U.S. imports approximately 21 tons of gallium, which represents 100% of domestic consumption, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. \nThe move comes as China has restricted exports of certain minerals, including rare earth elements, that are vital to the production of electronics and electric motors. Gallium, for example, is used in microwave circuits and blue and violet LEDs, which can be used to make powerful lasers.\nAlongside the critical minerals deal, Australia has agreed to buy $1.2 billion worth of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) from defense startup Anduril. The White House did not specify whether the purchase agreement is new or part of a previously announced $1.12 billion program under which Anduril will deliver a fleet of Ghost Shark AUVs to the Australian Navy. That deal was announced in September.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

    "body": "\nYelp is releasing multiple AI-powered updates Tuesday, including an updated AI assistant that can answer questions about restaurants, bars, local attractions, or retailers. The assistant can also scan a physical menu to provide information about dishes. Additionally, the company is improving search with support for natural language and voice queries, and highlighting popular offerings on business pages, including auto shops, hair salons, clothing stores, and parks. \nThe company launched an AI-powered assistant last year to help you connect with the right services by describing your problem. Yelp is now using similar technology to answer questions about other kinds of businesses, including a restaurant, bar, local attraction, and retailer. The assistant uses information from a business’s page, website, reviews, and photos to provide answers. For instance, you can ask about the kinds of animals you might see at a zoo.\nYelp is displaying pre-written questions on business pages based on frequently asked questions, so you don’t have to type them out yourself. The company said that the assistant for services will now remember your preferences and give you tailored recommendations for your next project.\nThe company is also improving search by allowing users to type questions in everyday language directly into the search box. The app will support these conversational queries through voice search.\nUntil now, Yelp has highlighted popular dishes and drinks on restaurant and bar pages. The company will now also show popular desserts on food outlets’ pages. Additionally, the company is expanding this feature to more than 100 business categories. Users will be able to see the top services offered by an outlet in a “most mentioned” section on each page — for instance, popular haircuts or color treatments at a salon.\nYelp is adding another AI-powered feature that helps diners explore menu items. Using AI image recognition, users can scan a physical menu with their phone camera and overlay bubbles will appear on screen over different dishes. Tap a bubble to see photos of that dish and read what diners have said about it.\nWith these new features, the company is making search more visual and conversational. In response to the rise of chat-style search tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity, established players like Google have also added similar features to their search and Maps to aid the discovery of new places.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEarlier this year, the company previewed AI-powered voice agents for restaurants and services businesses. With its new update, these tools are now available to businesses. The company’s AI host can take bookings, answer questions, handle special requests, and change reservations for restaurants. Its AI receptionist for services businesses can gather project details, help qualify leads, and send call summaries to the business’s Yelp inbox. Other companies like Square and Kea are also providing AI-powered voice solutions for restaurants and order management.\nWith this fall release, Yelp is also launching several additional features: AI-generated videos that compile user photos and narrate information about restaurants and bars; expanded video uploads (from 10 to 30 seconds); a new visual summary of restaurants and bars using photos and videos; grouped before-and-after photos for service businesses; and a new section for planning future projects.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAnthropic launched a web app on Monday for its viral AI coding assistant, Claude Code, which lets developers create and manage several AI coding agents from their browser.\nClaude Code for web is now rolling out to subscribers to Anthropic’s $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100- and $200-per-month Max plans. Pro and Max users can access Claude Code on the web by navigating to claude.ai (the same website for Anthropic’s consumer chatbot) and clicking into the “Code” tab, or through the Claude iOS app.\nThe launch marks Anthropic’s latest attempt to evolve Claude Code beyond a command-line interface (CLI) tool that developers access from a terminal. By putting Claude Code on the web, Anthropic hopes developers will spin up AI coding agents in more places.\nIt’s increasingly competitive for tech companies trying to make their AI coding tools stand out. While Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot once dominated the space, Cursor, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic now have highly performant AI coding tools of their own — many of them already available on the web. That said, Claude Code is arguably one of the most popular. Anthropic’s flagship coding tool has grown 10x in users since its broader launch in May, and the product now accounts for more than $500 million of the company’s revenue on an annualized basis.\nAnthropic product manager Cat Wu tells TechCrunch in an interview that she attributes a large part of Claude Code’s success to the company’s AI models, which have become a favorite among developers in recent years. However, Wu also says the Claude Code team deliberately tries to “sprinkle in some fun” to the product wherever they can.\nWu said that Anthropic will continue to put Claude Code in more places, but the terminal will likely remain the home base for their AI coding product.\n“As we look forward, one of our key focuses is making sure the CLI product is the most intelligent and customizable way for you to use coding agents,” said Wu. “But we’re continuing to put Claude Code everywhere, helping it meet developers wherever they are. Web and mobile are a big step in this direction.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnthropic claims that 90% of the Claude Code product itself is written by the company’s AI models. Wu, who was previously an engineer, says that she rarely ever sits down at a keyboard to write code anymore, and mostly just reviews Claude Code’s outputs. \nEarly AI coding tools worked like an autocomplete tool, finishing lines of code as developers wrote them. But the agentic generation of AI coding tools — including Claude Code — allow developers to spin up agents that work autonomously. This shift has made millions of software engineers act more like managers of AI coding assistants in their day-to-day jobs.\nThe change has not been welcome to every developer. One recent study found that some engineers were actually slower when using AI coding tools like Cursor. Researchers suggested one factor could be that engineers in the study spent much of their time prompting and waiting for AI tools to finish, rather than working on other problems. AI coding tools also struggle in large, complex code bases, so engineers may have spent a lot of time working through incorrect responses from the AI model.\nNevertheless, companies like Anthropic are continuing to push ahead making AI coding agents. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted a few months ago that AI should soon write 90% of code for software engineers. While that may be true inside of Anthropic, the shift may taken longer to pan out in the broader economy.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "\nAirbnb announced new features today that will help users connect with fellow travelers while participating in the same activity. The company is also improving search by suggesting properties that you might have missed due to your filters, and has redesigned the Maps view to let you search for points of interest such as nearby landmarks, attractions, and restaurants.\nEarlier this year, Airbnb launched Experiences, activities like cooking classes and guided tours that travelers can book and enjoy with other travelers. At the time, the company hinted that the Airbnb app would lean toward fostering connections with fellow travelers. The company is now releasing a few features in that direction.\nImage Credits: Airbnb\nFirst, when you book an experience, you will be able to see the names of other people who are in the same experience, along with where they are from. Once the event is over, you can connect with others you met during the experience to exchange photos or make further plans through the app’s chat feature after sending them a message request. Users will also see people they met in a new Connections tab on their profile.\nAirbnb said it has thought carefully about privacy, and the app gives you full control over sharing information with others. When you book an experience, you will get a pop-up asking if you want to share your profile picture, name, and where you are from. If you dismiss that, the app defaults to “don’t share,” and others will only see the picture and initials you choose to share.\nImage Credits: Airbnb\nThe company added that you can always block and report other users if you feel uncomfortable, and the community team will review your report. Plus, you can always remove the connection even after accepting a request.\nDuring the company’s summer release in May, it teased these features with the goal of increasing interaction between users that could result in more bookings for both properties and experiences. However, it will have to deal with the moderation issues that any chat-based social platform faces.\nImprovements to search and AI assistant expansion\nAs part of its winter release, the company is introducing a new search experience to show properties just outside users’ search criteria. To do this, the company will show three kinds of new scrollable lists (called carousels) in the search results. The first one will show properties that might be just outside your chosen price range; the second will show properties that might not have some of the amenities, such as a pool, that you selected; and the third one will show properties in nearby locations that would fit your criteria.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company said it observed that people often change search parameters to look at different properties and even book ones that are outside their initial constraints. With this new search experience, it is proactively showing some of those properties.\nAirbnb is also improving its maps view, which will now show points of interest around you, including landmarks, attractions, and restaurants. You can tap on these places to see a description and how far they are from your rental property or the location you’re considering. This is possibly another move to encourage people to use Airbnb more, even when they are traveling.\nThe travel tech company said earlier this year that it was rolling out an AI-powered assistant for customer service in the U.S. With this release, the bot is expanding to Mexico and Canada with support for English, Spanish, and French.\nThe company said that the assistant will now provide more detailed answers based on your profile, history, and reservation. Plus, the app will now provide users with quick action cards within the chat for tasks like cancellations or date changes.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAfrica’s electric mobility story has often been one of promise over progress. Infrastructure is scarce, power grids are unreliable, and most markets still run on cheap imported motorcycles. But Dubai-headquartered Spiro has spent the past two years trying to rewrite that narrative.\nThe company just announced a $100 million investment round led by The Fund for Export Development in Africa (FEDA), the development arm of Afreximbank. The raise marks Africa’s largest-ever EV mobility investment and cements Spiro as the continent’s most aggressive electric motorbike company.\nSpiro says it plans to deploy more than 100,000 electric bikes across Africa by the end of 2025, a 400% year-over-year jump that underscores its ambition to dominate a category long considered too fragmented to scale.\nSpiro’s growth has been dizzying. When CEO Kaushik Burman joined two years ago from Taiwanese battery-swapping giant Gogoro, the startup had just 8,000 electric bikes and 150 swap stations spread between neighboring countries Benin and Togo.\nToday, it operates in six countries—including Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda—with over 60,000 bikes deployed and 1,500 swap stations, where riders can swap depleted batteries for freshly charged ones. Battery swaps have surged from 4 million in 2022 to over 27 million this year, Burman told TechCrunch.\nThe secret behind that growth, Burman says, is a business model built for Africa’s realities.\nIn African cities, motorcycle taxis—known as boda bodas in Kenya or okadas in Nigeria—move people and goods through congested cities and rural towns alike. Yet for the millions of riders who rely on them, fuel costs are punishing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“These drivers spend 10 to 12 hours on the road every day, covering 150 to 200 kilometers while paying high fuel costs. At the end of each day, most barely save anything,” Burman said. “That’s why electric mobility, especially through a battery-swapping model, fits this segment perfectly. They can’t afford downtime and get to save some money.”\nThat’s the wedge Spiro is leaning into. According to Burman, its electric bikes cost roughly 40% less upfront than new gasoline models. In Kenya or Rwanda, where a typical gas bike sells for $1,300–$1,500, Spiro’s e-bikes cost around $800 and costs about 30% less per kilometer, since swapping batteries is cheaper than refueling, he says.\nThis combination of lower cost and faster payback has made Spiro’s model attractive for taxi drivers. Burman claims most riders — who pay a daily fee for access to its energy network — save up to $3 per day on fuel and maintenance. “That’s enough to buy another bike or start a small business over time,” the CEO remarked.\nSpiro earns revenue from both bike sales and its battery-swapping network. Riders buy or lease a Spiro bike, pick up a charged battery at a swap station, and pay only for the energy they consume. Each swap station houses dozens of batteries that are recharged continuously, ensuring zero downtime. Riders are billed via a proprietary algorithm that measures energy usage.\nThe network itself is Spiro’s profit engine: by owning the battery infrastructure and charging a small fee per swap, the company quickly achieves economies of scale. “In addition to battery swapping, we’re also using renewables and energy storage to ensure our network stays operational even during blackouts,” Burman said.\nSpiro’s swap stations are located in gas stations, shopping centers, and even religious institutions, a network built through partnerships that also creates local jobs.\nTo meet growing demand and increase employment opportunities, the three-year-old startup has established four assembly and manufacturing facilities across Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Uganda. These plants assemble bikes and key components such as traction motors, controllers, and batteries. \nSpiro already assembles batteries in Kenya using its proprietary battery management system (BMS) and plans to boost local sourcing from 30% today to 70% within two years, including plastics, helmets, and brake components, according to Burman.\nThe $100 million round — including $75 million from FEDA and the rest from other strategic investors — will help fund this expansion. It follows more than $180 million in previous investments, a mix of debt and equity from the Equitane Group (Spiro’s parent company) and Société Générale.\nThe new capital will go toward expanding Spiro’s swap network, manufacturing capacity, and R&D, as well as launching pilots in new markets like Cameroon and Tanzania.\nAs it scales, Spiro ought to face growing competition from other EV startups like Ampersand, ROAM, Max, or BasiGo. But Burman argues otherwise.\n“Our competition is the gasoline bike segment, both first and the secondhand bike segment and the millions of potential riders who don’t yet own a bike or lack access to affordable transportation and employment.”\nAfrica has around 25 million motorbikes, compared with 320 million in India, despite similar population sizes. That 13x gap, he said, shows the size of the opportunity ahead.\n"

    "body": "\nIn a region long defined by fragmented enterprise systems, outdated compliance tools, and HR software that rarely talks to finance, Cercli is building a unified alternative for MENA businesses with AI at its core.\nThe Dubai-based startup, founded by ex-Careem operators Akeed Azmi and David Reche, has announced an oversubscribed $12 million Series A round led by European VC Picus Capital.\nCercli today looks slightly different from the company that raised a $4 million seed round last year. It is rebuilding a Rippling-like stack for the MENA region, but making it AI-native from the ground up.\nOver the past year, that bet has paid off. The company says it has scaled revenue more than 10x and now processes over $100 million in payroll annually for multiple businesses across 50 countries.\nBut in a crowded HR-tech market—where dozens of startups such as Deel and Remote, alongside incumbents like SAP and Oracle, already promise everything from cross-border payments to payroll — why does the market need another HR tech player? CEO Azmi hopes its AI-first rebuild may be the edge that sets it apart.\nAzmi started Cercli to help enterprises with basic people operations, an issue he and Reche noticed at their previous employers, Careem and Kitopi, two of MENA’s best-known unicorns.\nWith payroll spread across multiple systems and compliance varying by region, the first version of Cercli focused on a platform that consolidated human resources management, payroll, and compliance for MENA-based companies operating globally.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Azmi says it envisioned a bigger opportunity if it baked in AI. So, over the past three months, Azmi says the company has rewritten its entire payroll engine to be multi-country and agent-compatible, enabling it to scale more efficiently across global jurisdictions.\n“The legacy systems of the last 20 years—your SAPs, Oracles, Workdays—they were built for on-prem and the cloud. Now we’re entering an AI-native world,” Azmi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We didn’t want to just integrate AI; we wanted to rethink the whole stack for how people and agents work together.”\nIt’s also done the same to its recruitment module. Cercli now offers agent-driven features that can surface candidate lists, source from internal datasets, and run background logic on hiring fit.\nIt’s own internal operations run on AI, as the company uses custom-built treasury and reconciliation agents to manage its own finances and accounting. That’s how the 14-person team closed its Series A while maintaining a 21% month-to-month revenue growth rate, according to Azmi.\nCercliImage Credits:Cercli\nBeyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.\n“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.\nAzmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.\nCercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.\nOther investors who participated in this Series A round include Knollwood Investment Advisory as well as existing investors Y Combinator, Afore Capital, and COTU Ventures.\nAs part of the investment, the company plans to build new AI-native products and work on gaining more market share in the $5.8 billion HR software opportunity in MENA.\n“We’ve seen this business model succeed globally within our portfolio, and we are excited to back Cercli as they continue to grow market share through new customers and product launches,” said Robin Godenrath, founding partner at Picus Capital.\n"

    "body": "\nCards Against Humanity, the irreverent party game company known for its provocative humor, has settled its trespassing lawsuit against SpaceX, one year after filing the complaint and launching a profanity-laced marketing campaign against Elon Musk’s rocket company.\nThe dispute centered on a plot of land along the Rio Grande in Cameron County, Texas, that Cards Against Humanity purchased in 2017. The company crowdfunded the purchase through 150,000 separate $15 donations ($2.25 million total) from supporters who wanted to help block President Donald Trump’s border wall.\nThe land happened to be located right next to where SpaceX has been building its Starbase rocket complex, a launch facility for the company’s spacecraft. That became an issue in 2024 when Cards Against Humanity accused SpaceX of trespassing on the property and dumping construction equipment and materials there. (SpaceX and a lawyer for the rocket company did not respond to a request for comment.)\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed. Cards Against Humanity had been seeking $15 million and had told supporters who helped fund the land that it hoped to pay them as much as $100 each from the proceeds. But those supporters won’t receive cash; instead, they can sign up for a “brand new mini-pack of exclusive cards all about Elon Musk,” a special expansion for the popular party game, according to an email they’ve just received.\n“So while we can’t give you what you really wanted—cash money from Elon Musk—we’re going to make it up to you, our best, sexiest customers … with comedy!” the company wrote in the email sent on Monday, referring to the new mini-pack of cards.\n“We’re happy to have stood up to a bully like Musk. We’re happy to have forced a settlement,” Cards Against Humanity told TechCrunch in a statement. The company says SpaceX has removed its construction equipment and that Cards Against Humanity is “working to restore [the land] to its natural state: devoid of space garbage and pointless border walls.” \nIn an email to its supporters last year, Cards Against Humanity had told them: “Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire — Elon Musk — snuck up on us from behind and completely f—-d your land with gravel, tractors, and space garbage.” It even launched a website titled “www.ElonOwesYou100Dollars.com.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCards Against Humanity said at the time that its “longstanding reputation as a company that makes outrageous promises and actually keeps them is on the line.” But it also warned those supporters in the email that “Musk has way more money and lawyers than we do, so you’ll probably get, like, $2 tops.” \nNow they won’t even get that amount.\nThe lawsuit had moved quickly. The two sides had already gone through the discovery process, where both parties exchange evidence before trial, and a trial was slated for November. Cards Against Humanity told TechCrunch on Monday that SpaceX even admitted to the trespass during discovery, which the gaming company called “a real vindication.”\nCards Against Humanity said Monday that it was “prepared to go to trial and we’re confident we would have won.” But the company ultimately decided that a trial “would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.” \n“Under Texas law, we likely wouldn’t be able to recoup our legal fees. We had the truth on our side, but Musk and SpaceX could easily outspend us,” the company said.\nMusk is well known for his willingness to fight his perceived enemies — and those of his companies — in court. He once claimed that Tesla’s “hardcore litigation department” would “never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.”\nDespite that, Musk and his companies often settle. The Cards Against Humanity case is not the first this year. Earlier this month, X settled a complaint filed by former Twitter executives. Tesla has settled a number of Autopilot-related cases. One Autopilot case that Tesla didn’t settle — despite having the chance to do so — became one of its highest-profile court losses to date.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nNew data indicates that use of Meta AI’s mobile app for iOS and Android has seen a significant increase. According to a new analysis from market intelligence provider Similarweb, the app’s daily active users across both platforms jumped to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from around 775,000 just four weeks ago. In addition, Meta AI’s app installs are also up, reaching 300,000 new downloads per day, compared with under 200,000 daily downloads a few weeks ago.\nFor comparison, Meta AI’s app had just 4,000 daily downloads a year ago, on October 17, 2024. \nImage Credits:Similarweb\nThe firm says it hasn’t seen any meaningful correlation in either search or advertising estimates, but notes Meta could be running Facebook or Instagram promotions that wouldn’t be captured in its model.\nHowever, there’s also another possible explanation for the sharp rise: the launch of Meta’s new Vibes feed in September, which introduced short-form AI-generated videos to the Meta AI mobile app. \nMeta AI introduced the Vibes feed on September 25, which correlates with the sharp increase in the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android, as seen in the chart below. \nImage Credits:Similarweb\nRecently, OpenAI’s video generator Sora drew headlines as its app reached the top of the App Store when users rushed to try the new technology. However, Meta AI could have benefited from this launch as well. While Similarweb says its data doesn’t prove cause and effect, it’s possible that the attention to Sora drove some people to try Meta AI, in order to compare the two experiences.\nAnother possibility is that Meta could be benefiting from Sora’s invite-only status. That is, those who couldn’t try out the OpenAI app may have looked for an alternative to experiment with. This would be an interesting explanation, too, as it suggests that OpenAI’s decision to gatekeep Sora may have directly boosted its rivals.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nAs of October 17, Meta AI’s app had seen a 15.58% increase in daily active users worldwide, while ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity saw declines of 3.51%, 7.35%, and 2.29%, respectively. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Introduced in iOS 26.1 beta 4, the option gives users more control over interface opacity after complaints that Liquid Glass made some elements harder to read.",
    "body": "\nApple has rolled out a new feature that makes it easier to customize Liquid Glass to your liking. Now users will be able to set the appearance of Liquid Glass to either Clear or Tinted, with the help of a new setting included in the latest beta update of its mobile and desktop operating systems.\nThe addition indicates Apple is listening closely to user feedback in these early days of the iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 public launches. Apples likes to push through more significant changes, but it will often offer a fallback option for those who have a hard time adjusting.\nThat was the case when Apple moved Safari’s address to the bottom of the screen in 2021. After some user backlash over the then controversial decision, the iPhone maker added an option to revert the bar to the top of the screen. (Apple, we’ll concede, was right to make the move; the bar’s location is better when it’s in easier reach of your thumbs.)\nNow Apple is taking a similar approach with Liquid Glass.\nThe new user interface that shipped with iOS 26 and other Apple operating systems was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move from a skeuomorphic to flat design back in 2013. As with most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome have said the Liquid Glass design makes various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps like Apple Music and others. Others have said they love Liquid Glass’s attention to detail and its new look, which felt like a more modern update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nWith another potential divisive response on its hands, Apple is now ceding some control over Liquid Glass’s appearance back to the users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThe new feature, first spotted by 9to5Mac, arrived in iOS 26.1 beta 4 and the accompanying updates for tablets and desktop computers.\nReached for comment, Apple told TechCrunch that, during the beta period this summer, it heard from some users who wanted the option to set a more opaque look for Liquid Glass. This new setting that lets users personalize Liquid Glass is available in iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS 26.1.\nTo access the feature, beta users can visit the “Display & Brightness” menu under Settings to find the added Liquid Glass menu option. On Mac, it’s under “Appearance” in System Settings. The control lets you choose between two options, Clear and Tinted. The latter increases the opacity of interface elements, making them easier to see. \n\nThough some users had been advocating for a slider that lets them control the opacity more precisely, Apple has opted for a toggle where it specifies the two levels of tint that users can choose from. \nApple told TechCrunch that any developers who have already implemented Liquid Glass in their apps will automatically have the user’s preference applied. Developers are able to test this now in the 26.1 developer beta.\nAfter selecting their preferred option, users will see changes across user interface elements, like the Now Playing controls, Notifications on the Lock Screen, and in Apple’s apps and those from third-party developers. \nWhile the beta feature arrives for developers today, the public beta should arrive over the next few days ahead of the wider public release. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Though plans to migrate Tumblr to WordPress infrastructure are on hold, Mullenweg said he hasn’t given up.",
    "body": "\nWordPress co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg called the company’s Tumblr acquisition his biggest failure — but one he hasn’t given up on yet. The comments were made at the recent WordCamp Canada 2025 conference, where Mullenweg went live for a Town Hall session to connect with the open source-focused WordPress community.\nThe exec noted that Tumblr was still on a different technical stack than WordPress — something he had intended to correct by migrating the back end to WordPress infrastructure. However, that massive undertaking was put on hold earlier this year, as the cost to move Tumblr’s half-billion blogs would be difficult given that the blogging platform wasn’t profitable and continues to be sustained by the profits of other Automattic products.\nThe company has tried to trim costs with layoffs and the reallocation of Tumblr resources to more profitable parts of the business, but those efforts have yet to pay off. \nMullenweg acknowledged these concerns at his Town Hall session, saying, “I need to switch [Tumblr] over to WordPress, but it’s a big lift. It’s over 500 million blogs, actually, and, as a business, it’s costing so much more to run than it generates in revenue.”\nAs a result, Automattic had to prioritize other projects to make Tumblr sustainable, he said.\n“It’s probably my biggest failure or missed opportunity right now, but we’re still working on it,” he added. \nIf Tumblr were to move to the WordPress back end, it would be simpler and more cost-effective to maintain. Plus, it would enable the service to further join the open social web known as the fediverse, which was to be one perk of the WordPress migration.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDuring the course of his talk, Mullenweg discussed the other projects underway at the company, including at WordPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. He mentioned Playground, which lets you run WordPress entirely in a web browser, and Automattic’s universal messaging app Beeper. The latter will be expanding to include support for bridges to other messaging apps, like KakaoTalk and messaging services from dating apps, he said.\nHe also touched on AI, saying, “We’re not putting the genie back in the bottle” with the technology, and calling companies like OpenAI “too big to fail.” In one area of the business, the WordPress theme directory, he’s thinking of tagging images made with AI to allow people to filter their searches appropriately, rather than rejecting AI-generated themes.\nNotably, Mullenweg answered a question about the legal drama with WP Engine, a WordPress hosting company that Automattic has called out for profiting from the open source ecosystem without giving back. In response to an audience question about bad actors who exploit the community, Mullenweg responded that he didn’t “want to say that there’s bad actors,” but rather “bad actions.”\nHe suggested that Automattic should create more incentive systems to encourage contributions and other good behavior, like giving certain people higher rankings in the WordPress directory or showcase. He also encouraged the community to “vote with your wallet” by not supporting businesses that aren’t doing the right thing.\n“There’s a site called WordPressEngineTracker.com which is currently tracking a number of sites that have left a certain host. It’s about to cross 100,000 … that have switched to other hosts, and there were 74,000 have gone offline since September of last year,” he said.\nThe court ordered the site taken down at one point, which Mullenweg told the crowd was them “trying to muzzle free speech and transparency.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhen Shin Starr set out to build an autonomous kitchen, the company knew that the gimmick of robotic cooking wouldn’t carry the business. What would make Shin Starr’s OLHSO Korean BBQ food truck successful is if it could cook and deliver a hot, fresh, tasty meal at a reasonable price.\n“At the end of the day, customers don’t care about the type of rocket science that is in your truck or in your kitchen,” Kish Shin, co-founder and CEO of Shin Starr, told TechCrunch. “They care about the value they’re getting.”\nHan Sungil, a chef with over 18 restaurants in Korea, came to the U.S. to lead Shin Starr’s culinary operations, which includes a brick-and-mortar restaurant in San Mateo — so there’s high expectations for the food. We can’t say from experience whether the food is a hit, but we’ll certainly be taste-testing some wagyu galbi and tteokbokki when the food truck rolls up to TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, where Shin Starr is part of the Startup Battlefield 200.\n\n\n\nCompanies like DoorDash are experimenting with autonomous delivery robots, but Shin Starr is doing the reverse: A human drives the truck, but the body of the vehicle is outfitted with the company’s “Autowok,” a modular, AI-powered robotics system that automates cooking, serving, and cleaning. Once Han preps the ingredients, the Autowok handles the rest.\nWhile the truck heads down the highway, Shin Starr’s robotic system retrieves the prepared, fresh ingredients from a refrigerator, then places them on a conveyor belt. They’re then dropped into a tilted cylindrical canister, which climbs to high heats like a wok and rotates to cook the food. After the food is cooked and tipped into its packaging, the system can clean and sanitize the canister and put it back into the flow for cooking.\n“It was designed to be able to serve food and cook en route,” Shin said. “So, if you have ordered a wagyu beef dish from your location, let’s say the truck was 15 minutes away. It takes us eight minutes to cook wagyu beef [so it] won’t start cooking your food until it has moved seven minutes closer to your location, so that when you get your food, your food is literally freshly cooked.”\nImage Credits:Shin Starr\nOther robotic kitchen startups have struggled to find product-market fit, but Shin Starr thinks it can find its niche in airports. Soon the company will open an OLHSO micro restaurant in a leading California airport, and if that goes smoothly, the company has other airports interested in implementing the technology.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSince their airport micro restaurant does not need to be staffed by humans, it can operate at any hour of the day.\n“At 11 p.m., all the restaurants close down. There’s no food for the next eight hours, and still, 10% of all people fly in the U.S. during those hours, 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.,” said Tord Olav Dønnum, Shin Starr’s CMO. “This thing will finally give you a fresh, high-quality restaurant type of meal, without having to buy a Snickers bar from a vending machine or a dry sandwich.”\nShin Starr snagged Gower Smith as CPO, which is a wise hiring decision, since there are few people in the world who know as much as Smith does about high-tech automated retail. He’s a serial entrepreneur in the space and most recently lead Swyft, which partners with companies like Best Buy and CVS to create luxury vending machines in places like train stations and airports. This allows brands to set up shop without devoting human labor or a significant physical footprint.\nSmith said that the automated nature of the micro restaurant makes it easier to give customers a prediction of how long it will take for their order to cook; it’s useful in a setting like an airport, where people may be rushing to catch a flight. The micro restaurant needs periodic intervention from a human worker to restock the fridge and prepare the ingredients, but otherwise, it should be able to run smoothly on its own.\n“Airports is where we’ll start, but we’ll go into hotels; people are hungry at 2 a.m. when they get in from travels, and they want a high-quality meal,” Smith told TechCrunch. “If it’s in a hospital, or on a college campus at 2 a.m. … There are lots of these environments where we can bring this sort of experience.”\nIf you want to learn more about Shin Starr from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nOver the past few weeks, the Department of Energy has been looking at canceling billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. Now the federal agency has confirmed that it’s axing $720 million worth of manufacturing awards.\nThe cuts affect companies that make battery materials, recycle lithium-ion batteries, and manufacture super-insulating windows. \nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright has been combing through contracts made during the Biden administration. The DOE claimed that the projects “missed milestones” and “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs,” spokesperson Ben Dietderich told E&E News.\nAll of the money for the grants was authorized by Congress as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021. The bulk of the money was awarded in 2023 and 2024; previously, the Trump administration had used grants awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling awards.\nThree startups are on the list, and all three were selected for grants well before the 2024 presidential election.\nAscend Elements has been refining a recycling technology that could turn manufacturing waste and end-of-life batteries into materials required to make lithium-ion batteries domestically. In October 2022, the company was awarded $316 million toward a $1 billion facility in Kentucky. \nAlready, $206 million has been disbursed to Ascend Elements, according to federal government records. The company said it was moving ahead with its plans using other sources of funding to make up for any shortfall.\nAnovion was awarded $117 million to reshore a technology to produce synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries anodes. Chinese suppliers control 75% of the supply chain for synthetic graphite and produce 97% of all synthetic graphite anodes, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The startup’s plant is slated to be built in Alabama and, to date, only $13.8 million has been disbursed, according to a federal database.\nAnother startup, LuxWall, makes windows that insulate buildings as well as solid walls, a breakthrough that  could slash energy use and reduce people’s utility bills. The DOE had awarded the company $31.7 million to build a factory on the site of an old coal plant near Detroit. The award was granted in November 2023, though only $1 million has been sent to the company, according to government records. LuxWall opened the first phase of its factory in August 2024.\nTechCrunch had previously reported on the Department of Energy’s efforts to cancel these and other contracts. \nThe grants had been intended, in part, to launch the startups over the “valley of death” that can claim many promising companies as they transition from technology development to commercial deployment. First-of-a-kind factories and facilities aren’t easy for startups to finance, and government grants like these encouraged private investors to contribute capital. Once up and running, they can serve as a template for future factories, bolstering the country’s manufacturing base.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "One post, authored by Khan’s staff, was published on January 3, 2025, with the title “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm.” It noted that the FTC was “taking note of AI’s potential for real-world instances of harm — from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.” ",
    "body": "\nThe Federal Trade Commission has removed three blog posts from the Lina Khan era that addressed open source AI and risks of AI to consumers, according to a Wired report.  \nOne post, titled “On Open-Weights Foundation Models,” was published July 10, 2024. Another, titled “Consumers Are Voicing Concerns About AI,” came out in October 2023. A third, authored by Khan’s staff, was published on January 3, 2025, with the title “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm.” That post noted the FTC was “taking note of AI’s potential for real-world instances of harm — from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.” \nTechCrunch has reached out to the FTC to learn why the posts were taken down. Khan declined to comment.  \nThese removals are part of a broader pattern under the Trump administration, which began issuing executive orders to direct federal agencies to remove or modify substantial amounts of government content.\nAfter his inauguration, Trump also installed a new head of the FTC and removed several FTC commissioners, installing leadership that focused less on Khan’s aggressive antitrust agenda and more on deregulation for Big Tech. In September, new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson submitted recommendations for deleting or revising anticompetitive regulations across the entire federal government.\nThe blog posts most recently removed by the FTC, which focused on consumer harm, don’t seem to align with the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan. That plan has reduced its focus on safety and guardrails, instead favoring fast growth and competition with China. However, the Trump administration has been vocal about backing open source initiatives.  \nFormer FTC public affairs director Douglas Farrar told TechCrunch: “I was shocked to see that Andrew Ferguson led FTC be so out of line with the Trump White House on this signal to the market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis is not the first time this administration’s FTC has removed content. In March, Wired reported that the FTC removed around 300 posts related to AI, consumer protection, and the agency’s lawsuits against tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft.  \nWhile hundreds of blog posts from Khan’s tenure and earlier remain on the agency’s Office of Technology Blog, Ferguson’s FTC has yet to publish any posts to the site, despite the feverish pace of the AI race, which has resulted in several business mergers and acquisitions — including acqui-hires — that could be seen as anticompetitive.\nThe FTC blog culling follows the Trump administration’s removal or modification of thousands of government web pages and datasets, particularly content related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; gender identity; public health; and environmental policy. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has removed data on topics ranging from chronic medical conditions to HIV/AIDS. The Justice Department has removed studies on hate crimes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has taken down the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports.  \nThe removal of content — including the blog posts from the FTC — could violate the Federal Records Act, which requires federal agencies to preserve records that properly document government activities, and the Open Government Data Act, which requires agencies to publish their data as “open data” by default. \nThe Biden administration’s FTC leadership placed warning labels on content published during previous administrations that it disagreed with, according to Wired. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

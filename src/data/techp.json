    "body": "\nTwo more nuclear companies have been awarded large grants by the Trump administration.\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec will each receive $400 million from the Department of Energy to build small modular reactors based on existing nuclear fission technology. \nThe TVA will build one 300-megawatt reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi in Tennessee, while Holtec will build two of its 300-megawatt reactors in Michigan. \nTech companies have warmed to nuclear power in recent years as their demand for electricity has grown alongside their AI ambitions.\nThe reactors to be built are considered Generation III+ designs, which are refinements of existing designs that have been in use for decades. By shrinking them down to “small modular” size, the hope is that costs will come down as parts are mass produced and engineering and construction crews become more familiar with building them.\nTo date, though, only two small modular reactors are operational, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n"

The provision failed then due to strong resistance from both parties.\nSilicon Valley has supported such measures, arguing that state regulations create an unworkable patchwork of rules that could stymy innovation. \nCritics argue that most state AI legislation is focused on safety, transparency, and consumer protections, and in the absence of federal AI laws that perform those tasks, blocking states from regulating would be effectively handing over control to Big Tech with no oversight.\nScalise reportedly acknowledged that the defense bill was not the place to include such a provision, and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as a separate bill. A leaked draft executive order signals Trump is considering taking matters into his own hands, though those efforts have reportedly paused for now.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “extremist activity.“\nAccording to a translation of an article in TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban.\nRoblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon.\nThe ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent reports have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators. In the U.S., Roblox has faced legal probes from the attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana. Roblox has since introduced age checks and content moderation tools aimed at keeping children safe — beginning in January, the company plans to implement mandatory facial verification to access Roblox’s chat features. (However, facial verification technology comes with safety concerns of its own.)\nRoblox has also asked developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content. This sparked backlash from advocacy groups like Out Making Games, Women in Games, and BAME in Games, which represent minority groups in the gaming industry. In an open letter, the groups wrote that Roblox considered topics like “pay equity in sports” to be “sensitive.”\n“While parental controls serve an important purpose, they shouldn’t come at the expense of fundamental human dignity,” the letter said. “We are calling on Roblox to reconsider these guidelines and find ways to protect young users without legitimizing discrimination or silencing important voices.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Appfigures, an app intelligence firm, Roblox was installed an estimated 70 million times in Russia on mobile, with about 8 million downloads so far this year.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nFintech company Marquis is notifying dozens of U.S. banks and credit unions that they had customer data stolen in a cyberattack earlier this year. \nDetails of the cyberattack emerged this week after Marquis filed data breach notices with several U.S. states confirming its August 14 incident as a ransomware attack.\nTexas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States.\nAt least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed.\nTexas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people.\nMarquis said in its notice with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state.\nThe number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states.\nMarquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers.\nAccording to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a zero-day, meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers. \nMarquis did not attribute the ransomware attack to a particular group, but the Akira ransomware gang was reportedly behind the mass-hacks targeting SonicWall customers at the time. \nTechCrunch asked Marquis if it is aware of the total number of people affected by the breach, and if Marquis received any communication from the hackers or if the company paid a ransom, but we did not hear back by the time of publication.\nDo you know more about the Marquis data breach?

    "body": "\nEarlier this year, home goods maker Kohler launched a smart camera called the Dekoda that attaches to your toilet bowl, takes pictures of it, and analyzes the images to advise you on your gut health. \nAnticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.”\nThe company’s use of the expression “end-to-end encryption” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. \nBy reading Kohler’s privacy policy, it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. \nUsing the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. \nA Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”\nThe security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nCan any company, big or small, really topple Nvidia’s AI chip dominance? Maybe not. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those who can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week.\nAs expected, the company revealed at the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is 4x faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip.\nHe said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.”\nBedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models.\nJassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market.\nThat is, of course, Amazon’s classic MO, offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices.\nAdditionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an interview with CRN, about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said.\nProject Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October. Amazon is, of course, a major investor in Anthropic. In exchange, Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner, even though Anthropic is now also offered on Microsoft’s cloud via Nvidia’s chips. \nOpenAI is now also using AWS in addition to Microsoft’s cloud. But the OpenAI partnership couldn’t have contributed much to Trainium’s revenue because AWS is running it on Nvidia chips and systems, the cloud giant said.\nIndeed, only a few U.S. companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all the engineering pieces — silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect. and networking technology — to even attempt true competition with Nvidia. (Remember, Nvidia cornered the market on one major high-performance networking tech in 2019 when CEO Jensen Huang outbid Intel and Microsoft to buy InfiniBand hardware maker Mellanox.)\nOn top of that, AI models and software built to be served up by Nvidia’s chips also rely on Nvidia’s proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software. CUDA allows the apps to use the GPUs for parallel processing compute, among other tasks. Just like the Intel versus SPARC chip war of yesterday, it’s no small thing to rewrite an AI app for a non-CUDA chip.\nStill, Amazon may have a plan for that. As we previously reported, the next generation of its AI chip, Trainium4, will be built to interoperate with Nvidia’s GPUs in the same system. Whether that helps peel more business away from Nvidia or simply reinforces its dominance, but on AWS’s cloud, remains to be seen. \nIt may not matter to Amazon. If it is already on track to make multibillion dollars from the Trainium2 chip, and the next generation will be that much better, it may be winner enough.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "description": "Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous -- but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year. Now we're asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?",
    "body": "\nIs it time for MrBeast to hit the New York Stock Exchange? Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year. Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?\nIt’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. \nSo it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public.\n“You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin.\n“At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people.\nLike other major creators, the MrBeast business expands far beyond YouTube ad revenue and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg.\nHousenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already). Plus, the company is planning to launch a phone company, a financial services platform, and a theme park in Saudi Arabia. Sure, why not!\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDonaldson’s business has had its share of stumbles, though. Beast Industries is in an ongoing lawsuit with the ghost kitchen Virtual Dining Concepts for damaging his brand by selling “inedible” food from MrBeast Burger. Virtual Dining Concepts countersued him for allegedly breaching his contract.\nThen, after filming the first season of “Beast Games,” five contestants sued Donaldson and Amazon for alleged mistreatment and sexual harassment on set. The heavily redacted lawsuit states that the show filmed in an environment that “systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism.”\nIn conversation at DealBook, Donaldson said, “The big thing is, obviously, I learned why people don’t have 2,000 people compete in a show, because you’re creating a scenario where 1,999 aren’t happy, because they didn’t win … I don’t know how openly I’m allowed to speak, but obviously, yes, some people sue you. I’m sure people in here have been sued before because they just want to try to make money.”\nHousenbold cut in, “Listen, we’re always learning and getting better.” He was interrupted by laughter from the crowd. “Mistakes are part of success, so Season 2 is a lot better.”\nNot that Beast Industries’ missteps would prevent it from going public eventually, especially if it moves past them and can build the management discipline needed to bear the scrutiny of being public. \nDonaldson wouldn’t be the first creator-run business to go public — but he could pull off the first creator IPO that actually works. The esports team FaZe Clan went public in a $725 million SPAC but got acquired a year later in 2023 for just $17 million. In November, Pinkfong — the company that made the most-watched YouTube video, “Baby Shark” — went public in Korea.\n“From day one, we’re a global media company, and now we’re working on monetizing that viewership, that fandom, and that trust we built,” Housenbold said.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nIn early October, DualEntry, an AI enterprise resource planning (ERP) startup, announced a $90 million Series A round led by Lightspeed and Khosla Ventures, valuing the one-year-old business at $415 million. \nThe company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. \nHowever, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.”\nEven so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” \nThis approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance.\nKingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically.\n“Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis early aggressive funding contrasts with the last investment cycle.\n“The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures. He pointed out that massive funding into Uber and Lyft was a canonical example of this, but the capital weaponization for the ride-sharing companies didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.\nAs with Uber vs. Lyft, investors in DualEntry’s competitors Rillet and Campfire are evidently just as eager to see their bets succeed with the help of substantive capital. In early August, Rillet raised a $70 million Series B led by a16z and Iconiq, just two months after the company closed a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia.\nSimilarly, Campfire AI had two back-to-back funding rounds. In October, it grabbed a $65 million Series B, just a couple of months after announcing a $35 million Series A round led by Accel.\nAI ERP is just one of the several AI application categories where startups are raising funding in rapid succession. “There’s no new data between rounds. Series Bs happen 27-60 days after Series As regularly,” Jaya Gupta a partner at Foundation Capital, posted on X last month. Besides AI ERP, she wrote that she sees this pattern in categories such as IT service management and SOC compliance.\nWhile some startups like Cursor or Lovable have reportedly grown at a breakneck pace between their back-to-back rounds, several VCs told TechCrunch that’s not the case for all. AI ERPs and several other categories of startups that raised multiple rounds in 2025 still have ARRs in the single-digit millions, these investors said.\nAlthough not all VCs agree that kingmaking is a sound investment strategy, there are reasons why offering large amounts of capital could be beneficial even when the startup maintains a modest burn rate. For instance, well-funded startups are perceived as more likely to survive by large enterprise buyers, making them the preferred vendor for significant software purchases. That’s a strategy that helped legal AI startup Harvey attract large law firm customers, investors say.\nStill, history shows that massive capitalization offers no guarantee of success, with notable failures, including the logistics company Convoy and the bankruptcy reorg of scooter company Bird.\nBut those precedents don’t faze major VC firms. They prefer to bet on a category that seems like a good case for AI, and they would rather invest early because, as Peterson put it: “Everybody has fully internalized the lesson of the power law. In the 2010s, companies could grow faster and be bigger than almost anybody had realized. You couldn’t have overpaid if you were an early Uber investor.”\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nBrevo, a customer relationship management company headquartered in Paris, is now a unicorn — a startup valued at more than $1 billion. The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.\nFormerly known as Sendinblue, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M.\nThe U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. \n“That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.\nRevenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards. \nAfter joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.\nThat’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and also to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to invest €50 million in AI over five years, and to use acquisitions (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over €100 million, according to a press release.\nBrevo didn’t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table. \nRumors had described the deal as Brevo getting acquired, but Thiberge said Brevo’s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint retained 24% each, while Series A lead Partech completed its exit. \nThis makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo’s stated ambition to “build a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.” In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.\nFor Thiberge, “whoever has the best product wins, and it’s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.” There’s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. “I’m not saying it’s easy every day […] but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.”\nTo serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.\nThese functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo’s M&A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its €1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company’s shopping list should be extensive.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration announced plans Wednesday to lower fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States. \nWith CEOs from Ford and Stellantis in attendance, President Donald Trump proposed rolling back fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. The regulation change also reclassifies crossovers as cars instead of light trucks, and it eliminates automakers’ ability to trade electric vehicle credits.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates fuel economy rules under Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. Those rules, first enacted by Congress in 1975, dictate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations.\nTrump also said he would authorize the Department of Transportation to allow automakers to manufacture “really small cars” like the kind found in Japan and South Korea.\nThe White House claims that existing regulations would have caused automotive prices to increase by $1,000 per vehicle. The previous Trump administration made the same argument in 2020, when it last rolled back fuel economy standards.\nSince that rollback, though, the price of a new vehicle has climbed to new heights, topping $50,000 on average, as automakers discontinued low-end models to capitalize on consumers’ preferences for SUVs. Larger vehicles use more material, thus costing more to make, while also getting lower fuel economy.\nConsumers’ choices appear to run counter to the administration’s contention that lower fuel economies are in the car-buying public’s interests. For instance, hybrid sales are up significantly this year over last and momentum continues. Hybrid sales grew 6% in October over the previous month.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExperts doubt that lower fuel economy standards will change the trajectory of new vehicle prices. Many vehicles are developed with global markets in mind, and most of those still value efficiency.\n“The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we’re forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas, and pumping out more tailpipe emissions,” Gina McCarthy, former EPA administrator, said in a statement. “With their backwards thinking and never-ending efforts to create more pollution in this country, we are ceding the global car market and technological innovation to China.”\nSince the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, which eliminated penalties for automakers that don’t hit their marks, fuel economy standards have been essentially toothless. Instead, the regulatory move is likely intended to serve as a hurdle for future administrations to bring them back.\nAlready, automakers have been moving to sell more gas-guzzling vehicles. \nFord has indefinitely paused production of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, shifting capacity in favor of internal combustion models. Stellantis reintroduced its Hemi V-8 engines, though a review of the powertrain in the Ram 1500 has revealed that it performs worse in nearly every way than a more efficient inline-6.\nNot all automakers have decided to turn back, though. Hyundai is still committed to EVs, while its sibling Kia has given its EVs $10,000 discounts across the board.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nWordPress’s experimental AI development tool, Telex, has already been put to real-world use, only months after its September debut. At the company’s annual “State of the Word” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among other examples.\nTelex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website.\nWhile the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. \nIn the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something that a developer used to have to custom-build but could now be created in a few seconds.\nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word (opens in a new window)\nIn another demo, a developer used Telex to add real-time store hours, a phone number, and a link to get directions to the header block of their WordPress site. \nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word (opens in a new window)\nTelex was also shown being used to create a carousel of partner logos on a business’s site, a custom pricing tool, a Google Calendar integration, and a grid for posts on a WordPress homepage, where each post’s card on the site had the same height.\nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word (opens in a new window)\n“Again, things that you used to have to, like, hire developers, do custom software like this would have cost thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to build, even just years ago. We’re now able to do in a browser for pennies,” said Mullenweg. “It’s kind of insane.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word\nAnother developer, Tammie Lister, used Telex to create a new Gutenberg block every day in the month of October, creating things like a playable, ASCII version of Tetris and a trick-or-treat block for Halloween.\nIn an email to TechCrunch, Hamze touted Telex’s capabilities, saying, “the thing that blows my mind and should blow yours is I’m not a developer. I can’t write a single line of code, but I can describe what I want to Telex, and it can make it for me. That freedom is intoxicating, and I’m all in on AI,” he said. \n“I think as long as people think of these tools as ‘developer’ tools, they are missing the point on what they can really accomplish, which is letting regular folks do things they never could have done before,” Hamze added.\nThe Telex demos were discussed alongside other AI-focused initiatives at WordPress, including architectural developments, like the Abilities API and MCP adapter. The former defines what WordPress can do in a way that AI systems can interpret, the company explained, while the latter exposes those abilities so any MCP-compatible tool can understand and use them.\n“This adapter pattern means WordPress can participate in AI workflows without duplicating logic or creating separate integrations for every AI platform,” Mullenweg told event attendees. “So you can now connect a WordPress installation to popular tools like Claude, Copilot, and many other platforms that support MCP.” \nIn addition, he noted that developers were already using AI in their everyday workflows through tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other next-generation CLIs. This, Mullenweg said, “means you can refactor projects, search code bases, automate tasks, [and] run scripts with WP CLI alongside the AI agent.”\nMullenweg said that, in 2026, WordPress would introduce some benchmarks and evaluations that AI models can use to test on WordPress tasks, like changing plugins, editing text, or even manipulating the WordPress interface using browser agents.\nThis article was updated after initial publication with a comment from Hamze.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nElevenLabs struck a deal with actors Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to AI-generate their voices, the company announced this week.\nHollywood and AI have an up-and-down relationship, with its guardrails — or lack thereof — serving among the main concerns that led to the Hollywood strikes a few years ago. Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI.\nLast year, Meta announced that its Meta AI would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice.\nElevenLabs also announced this week that it was launching a marketplace to let brands use authorized AI-generated voices of celebrities, which will include Caine and other names like Liza Minnelli and Dr. Maya Angelou. ElevenLabs is one of the more popular AI unicorn companies and has backers including a16z and ICONIQ.  \n\n\tTopics\n"

    "body": "\nThe solar activity that’s been lighting up the night sky across North America this week is now causing Jeff Bezos’ space company to push back the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nJust hours before the scheduled launch on Wednesday, Blue Origin said it is standing down from the attempt due to the solar activity and its “potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft” — a Mars-bound science mission the company is carrying to space for NASA. A new launch date has not yet been announced.\nNew Glenn’s first launch in January was mostly a successful demonstration mission of the rocket. Blue Origin delayed the second launch multiple times, though, and the company is being cautious since this is the first time the rocket has a commercial payload onboard. \nNew Glenn nearly took off this past Sunday, but weather concerns and an errant cruise ship in the flight path, plus some issues with the launch pad equipment, caused the company to shelve the attempt.\n"

The acquirer is the music and technology company Stingray Group, which will pay $150 million at closing and up to $25 million one year later.\nIt financed the deal with a loan under its renewed credit facility, the company said on Wednesday.\nFounded in 2002, TuneIn was an early player in the online music space. Unlike rivals such as Apple Music or Spotify Premium that offer ad-free, subscription-based music on demand, TuneIn focused on streaming traditional radio stations over the internet. This business model also allowed TuneIn to deliver a wide variety of content beyond music, like news, talk, and live sports. The company attempted to monetize this content through a paid subscription that also included audiobooks and ad-free radio channels.\nHowever, the company struggled to compete in the crowded streaming market, particularly as consumer demand for talk radio shifted to podcasts, and people grew comfortable paying for ad-free music subscriptions.\nStingray, a Montreal-based company that owns radio stations and provides music tech and advertising services, acquired TuneIn to expand its reach, particularly through partnerships with device manufacturers, automakers, and content providers. The company noted that TuneIn’s content is available on more than 200 platforms and connected devices, including over 50 in-car audio systems, spanning more than 100 countries.\nThe $175 million purchase price was based on TuneIn’s forecasted sales of $110 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025. TuneIn has over 75 million monthly active listeners worldwide.\nStingray says the TuneIn brand will remain. Once the deal closes, Stingray expects its revenue to exceed $400 million.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n"

(Users who use an authenticator app are unaffected.)\nX said this was part of an effort to retire the older twitter.com domain, which currently redirects to x.com. That change took effect in May 2024. The problem is that passkeys and security keys are digitally tied to the old twitter.com domain and can’t be transferred to x.com. That means users have to manually un-enroll and re-enroll using the new x.com domain.\nAs part of the switchover, X warned that after November 10, customers would have their accounts locked until they re-enroll or choose another method of two-factor authentication. \nNow that the deadline has passed, plenty of users are reporting that they’ve been locked out of their accounts and can’t re-enroll their passkey or security key, citing error messages or getting caught in an endless loop.\nThis is the latest issue to beset X, now owned by Elon Musk after he bought Twitter, as it was known then, for $44 billion. Since taking charge of the social networking site, the company has experienced massive layoffs and countless controversies.\nX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk, who now owns X, has been posting as usual, presumably unaffected by the change.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSearch and rescue missions often happen in areas that are difficult for humans to navigate due to extreme weather, rough terrain, or dangerous conditions like smoke or dust.\nA researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) wants to send robots inspired by bats on these missions instead of humans.\nNitin J. Sanket, a professor at WPI, has developed small flying robots with his team that fit in the palm of a hand and use ultrasound — just like bats. These robots use AI-powered software to filter out noise from the ultrasound signals the devices collect, allowing them to spot obstacles within a two-meter radius.\n“Search and rescue is done on foot,” Sanket told TechCrunch. “There are a lot of people who go on foot with flashlights in really harsh conditions and put their lives at danger to save others. We thought drones are the answer because they can cover a lot of ground really fast. They can be agile and quick.”\nNitin Sanket.Image Credits:Nitin Sanket / WPI\nSanket has long been fascinated by aerial robots and drones and how the tech can be retrofitted for real-world situations. During his PhD program, his adviser challenged him to create the smallest robot possible, which sparked his research into taking cues from biology to build smaller machines.\n“We had to reimagine what a drone would be at that point, which is go back to biology, because biology does this way better than we can today,” Sanket said. “How do insects or birds do it with super limited compute and not-so-good sensing apparatus? Their eyes are not that great, their brains are really small, but they’re still able to do these amazing feats of flight. So we started looking at that, and that’s what gave rise to my PhD thesis.”\nSanket built a prototype of a robotic beehive made up of small drones that could pollinate flowers. Despite his efforts, he realized that this application was probably a moonshot and started thinking of areas where biology-based robots could make a difference sooner, which led him to his current project.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the search and rescue robots, the main challenge was building something with the necessary sensors and flying technology without making the robot too large, expensive, or energy intensive.\nSanket said they turned to the ultrasound sensors used in automatic faucets because they require very little power. While that approach worked, the propellers they built on the robots created too much noise, which overloaded the sensor’s ability to spot obstacles.\nTo fix this problem, they turned back to bats.\n“Bats have these special tissues in their nose, ears, and mouth which adaptively change in thickness and density to modulate the way they hear and chirp sound,” Sanket said. “We were like, ‘Okay, that’s super cool.’ Can we do something like that? We designed a 3D-printed structure to place in front of the robot, which essentially does the same [functionally, as] what a bat does, which is change the shape of the sound itself.”\nNow that they’ve been able to get the robots to work, they are working to tackle their next challenge: improving their speed.\n“We, as human beings, like to try to mimic a lot of things the human brain does,” Sanket said. “We tend to forget how remarkable other animals are, which are much smaller than us. Especially insects and birds, which are much tinier, can actually do remarkable feats of navigation, which I think we don’t really see often. I think we should think more as scientists rather than just pure engineers.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV’s parent company, Google, has been locked in a standoff with Disney for nearly two weeks. The dispute began when the two companies failed to reach an agreement on a streaming deal.\nThis means that for 12 days and counting, 10  million YouTube TV subscribers like myself have not been able to access Disney-owned TV networks like ABC and ESPN, which comprise around 20 different channels.\nBusiness Insider called sports fans “the big losers” in this standoff. The New York Times and Engadget are publishing guides to help viewers tune into must-watch college football games. But the press has ignored a beleaguered demographic suffering in silence while their peers boot up Fubo trials to watch Monday Night Football.\nIt’s me. I’m beleaguered. I can’t watch “Jeopardy!” because it airs on ABC.\n“Jeopardy!” is a longstanding fixture in my nightly routine. I finish work. I make dinner. I watch “Jeopardy!” So imagine my surprise in early November when I turned on YouTube TV, only to find that the most recent episode had not recorded. In fact, months of my “Jeopardy!” recordings had vanished! The horror! Who’s the current “Jeopardy!” champion? Has Ken Jennings worn any cool ties lately? I don’t know. Because I can’t watch “Jeopardy!”\nYouTube TV and Disney have been locked in this public dispute for weeks. On October 23, YouTube TV wrote in a statement that it has been “working in good faith” to negotiate a deal with Disney, but that the company is “proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers … while benefitting Disney’s own live TV products.” From Disney’s perspective, YouTube TV is “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\nOn Sunday, YouTube TV announced that it would give subscribers a $20 credit — which must be manually redeemed — to compensate for nearly two weeks of a Disney blackout. While I thank the $3.46 trillion giant Google for its generosity, might I point out that in 2021, when a similar dispute blacked out Disney’s channels from YouTube TV for one day, subscribers got a $15 credit? (Also, YouTube TV cost almost $20 less per month back then.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Disney will lose an estimated $60 million over two weeks — $4.3 million per day — by not making a deal with YouTube TV. But Disney could also be generating new income streams with the recently launched ESPN Unlimited subscription, which gives subscribers access to all ESPN content for $30 per month. However, we must note that ESPN Unlimited crucially does not include “Jeopardy!,” America’s Favorite Quiz Show®.\nI could, like many others, use this opportunity to scope out other cord-cutting streamers, perhaps those owned by Disney — however, I may or may not be sharing my YouTube TV account with five other people, leaving me pretty locked into a sweet deal. (Please, YouTube TV, don’t pull a Netflix on me.)\nWhen will this national nightmare end? When will I once again be able to criticize contestants’ mathematically illogical Daily Double wagers? When will I be reminded that I know literally nothing about opera? The ball’s in your court, Mr.  Mouse.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nCrafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do.\nHero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps.\nHere is how it works: When you are booking a flight, you might write “Book a flight” in the prompt. The autocomplete SDK will start populating fields like “to,” “from,” “on date,” “at time,” “airline,” and “returning on.” You can stop at any point and send the query to the chatbot.\nImage Credits:Hero\nThis is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe’s new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets users enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune.\nAdobe’s way to approach easier prompt generation for creating a soundtrack.Image Credits:Adobe\nHero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. With this autocomplete feature, you can get there with fewer prompts — or even just one.\n\n\n\nThe startup’s co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next.\n“With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. This unlocks a whole new set of use cases ranging from travel to commerce, and ads to customer support,” Kowalk said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs.\nKowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query.\nThe startup, which raised $4 million in seed funding last year, has secured $3 million in additional funding led by Forerunner Ventures. Kowalk said that in the coming months, depending on the app and SDK growth, Hero plans to raise a bigger round.\nHero is testing a version of this technology in its app that helps users find time for a meeting or to catch up with a friend through autocomplete prompts. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months.\nThe company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOne of the most effective use cases to have emerged from modern AI models is their ability to understand the human voice better, which has led to more accurate dictation tools. One such Mac tool, Willow, is launching an iOS app to let users type with their voice across all apps.\nSimilar to Wispr Flow, Willow’s keyboard transcribes your voice and also formats the message according to the context. The app, which supports over 100 languages, lets you define your own vocabulary terms or create different writing styles across app categories like work, messaging, email, and others.\nOne key advantage of Willow’s app is that there is a full keyboard available to type, whereas Wispr Flow only offers a numeric keyboard. This helps with quick edits to modify some words or sentences rather than typing them out. Plus, you don’t have to switch to another keyboard when you want to type some words instead of speaking them.\nImage Credits Willow\nWillow was founded by Allan Guo and Lawrence Liu, who attended Stanford and dropped out to build a startup. Gui got into Y Combinator in the summer of 2024 with a different set of co-founders, and their initial idea was in healthcare — specifically to build software to manage assisted living facilities. However, the idea didn’t stick, and for a year, the company tried to build different things.\n“While we were working on healthcare solutions, we noticed that doctors have voice AI scribes that record conversations with patients and create documents for follow-ups. I had a lot of conversations with doctors; they said these notetakers were very useful to them. This nudged us to build a voice AI tool for knowledge workers and other users,” Guo told TechCrunch over a call. \nGuo added that he chose not to build another AI notetaker because he felt that the market was saturated. Instead, the dictation space was more appealing as a lot of communication takes place outside meetings. He said that the company uses a series of models and focuses heavily on tuning its text-to-text pipeline, which is based on Meta’s Llama models, for formatting and personalization\nImage Credits: Willow\nThe startup then moved its YC batch to Spring 2025 to launch the product. The company said that since the launch, it has grown 50% month over month in terms of users. It also has enterprise customers like Uber, Heidi Health, and Zeg using the tool for dictation with features like custom team vocabulary.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWillow has raised $4.5 million from Box Group, Y Combinator, Burst Capital, and angel investors such as HubSpot’s Dharmesh Shah; Gusto’s Tomer London; Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; ex-Yelp COO Kipp Bodnar; Opendoor CEO Kaz Nejatian; Adam Guild, co-founder and CEO of the restaurant software company Owner; and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen.\nMullen said that he believes that the most amazing user interfaces in the future are going to be voice-led.\n“I was really impressed with Allan’s vision around not just creating a great dictation app but, long term, aiming for creating an interface that can control your computer,” he said. “When I am writing through Willow, I need to make fewer edits than I had to with a computer’s built-in dictation system.”\nMullen pointed out that one of his favorite workflows was that on desktop, you can also use the “Hey Willow” assistant to instruct the app to write things like email replies in your own voice.\nThe startup competes with other players like Wispr Flow, which has raised more than $56 million in funding to date; Monologue, which is part of Every’s subscription bundle; and the YC-backed startups Aqua, Talktastic, Superwhisper, and Betterdication.\nGuo said that in the coming months, it plans to do platform expansion with Windows and Android, along with better personalization to reduce the number of manual edits users have to do post dictation. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt, someone from the audience asked him if HBO’s hit satire “Silicon Valley” would be revived. Costolo, who was a writer for the show, essentially answered no (at timestamp 38:17).\nWhile the writers talk about that regularly, he said, they don’t pursue it because today’s actual Silicon Valley is so bizarre, it can’t be parodied.  \nThe latest case in point is a new company called Clad Labs that launched out of Y Combinator this week. Clad’s product is so outside-the-box that people thought it was an April Fools’ joke in November. \nBut it’s a real product, founder Richard Wang told TechCrunch. The product is called “Chad: The Brainrot IDE.” It is yet another vibe coding integrated development environment — an IDE is the software developers use to code — but with a twist. While waiting for the AI coding tool to finish its task, the developer can mess around with their favorite brainrot activities within a window of the IDE. \nOr, as the company’s website advertises: “Gamble while you code. Watch TikToks. Swipe on Tinder. Play minigames. This isn’t a joke — it’s Chad IDE, and it’s solving the biggest productivity problem in AI-powered development that nobody’s talking about.” \nThe founders say their IDE increases productivity by helping with “context switching.” Their argument is, by doing your brainrot activities within the IDE itself, as soon as the AI is done with the task, you’ll get right back to work rather than be focused on your phone or browser. \nReaction on X was mixed. While some people thought it was a fake satire, others thought it was a good — or a terrible — idea.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLike it or hate it, everyone had an opinion, even Jordi Hays, co-host of the enthusiastically pro-tech podcast TBPN. Hays penned a post on the product called, “Rage Baiting is for Losers.” In it he said of Chad IDE: “On one hand it’s funny. On the other hand, what are we doing here and why does this belong on the official YC account?” \nHe argued that products like Chad IDE and Cluely have moved rage bait from a marketing gimmick to a “product strategy” and “it really should not be.” He urged YC to start teaching founders that “rage baiting is for losers.” \nThis is particularly interesting advice from someone who, as a founder, had mastered viral marketing without rage. Hays and his wife Sarah founded Party Round, a funding startup that went viral for their friendly marketing gimmicks like launching NFT versions of top “helpful” VCs. (Party Round rebranded to Capital and sold to Rho in 2024.) \nWang tells TechCrunch what the haters don’t get about his brainrot IDE is that it wasn’t intended to be rage bait. The founders hope it becomes a genuinely beloved AI vibe coder for consumer-app type developers. They want to give these folks a consumer app-like experience in an IDE.\nWhile the product is real, it’s not available to the public yet. \n”We’re currently in a closed beta,” Wang said. Right now, Chad is attempting to build a “community” of users who like the idea. Clad Labs hopes to open the product to the public soon, but for now, users must get an invite from someone already in the beta.\nNo doubt there’s a certain type of developer who would love Chad. But whatever the future holds for this product, one thing is true: It is nearly impossible to parody Silicon Valley these days. \n"

    "body": "\nMirova, the French climate-focused investment firm backed by Kering and other corporate heavyweights, has invested $30.5 million (€26.4 million) in Indian climate tech startup Varaha. This investment will help to expand the startup’s regenerative farming program, supporting hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers in northern India.\nThe deal marks Mirova’s first carbon investment in India, but its structure is unusual. Rather than taking equity, the Paris-based firm is investing cash, and will get a share of the carbon credits generated in return over time.\nThis arrangement is part of Mirova’s carbon investment strategy, which channels corporate capital into verified emissions-reduction projects. The firm is an affiliate of Natixis Investment Managers and counts among its backers Gucci parent Kering, Orange, L’Occitane Group, Capgemini, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, and MANE. All of these are companies seeking to offset supply-chain emissions through credible carbon initiatives.\nRegenerative farming — the practice of restoring soil health and enhancing biodiversity through methods such as crop rotation and reduced tillage — is gaining traction as a practical approach to making agriculture more resilient to climate change. In India, where millions of small farmers face declining soil fertility and erratic rainfall, the approach is as much about survival as sustainability. \nFounded in 2022, Varaha designs and operates carbon projects across regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, and biochar. It works through a network of 48 local partners to carry out field operations and its software monitors these projects in real-time, reporting, and verifying both climate and social outcomes.\nMirova is investing in Varaha’s Kheti project, which works with farmers in the Indian states of Haryana and Punjab to adopt low-emission practices and generate verified carbon credits that can provide an additional source of income. So far, the project covers over 200,000 hectares and is expected to reach around 337,000 farmers across 675,000 hectares as it scales.\nVaraha’s approach is rooted in practices tailored to India’s cropping systems, especially in the country’s rice-growing belt. The startup focuses on direct seeding of rice and incorporating crop residue into the soil — a crucial alternative to the widespread practice of burning stubble after harvest, Madhur Jain, co-founder and CEO of Varaha, said in an interview.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Instead of burning the residue, you use agricultural machinery to cut it on the farm and mix it back into the soil,” he told TechCrunch.\nThe startup also promotes reduced tillage, cutting back from multiple ploughing rounds to just one or two, which helps conserve soil carbon and improve the soil’s capacity to store more over time.\nVaraha Kheti Project’s Field experiementImage Credits:Varaha\nThe startup plans to use Mirova’s investment to help it procuring the machinery needed to implement regenerative practices.\n“If you have to do direct seeding of rice rather than transplanting, which requires a lot of water, you need thousands of direct seeders,” said Jain. “Because this isn’t yet a conventional practice, the number of seeders available in the market is much lower than what’s required. So you need to go to the manufacturers and get them. Similarly, for crop residue incorporation, you need machines such as happy seeders and super seeders.”\nThe credits generated under the program will be verified using Verra’s VM0042 methodology, with a revenue-sharing model designed to channel proceeds directly to participating farmers. The project is also seeking Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) certification from Verra, a non-profit, which recognizes land management projects that deliver co-benefits for the environment, local communities, and biodiversity.\nWhile Verra is one of the key organizations verifying carbon credits globally, it has faced criticism following investigations that suggested some projects it approved may have overstated their carbon savings.\nVaraha still prefers to use Verra for its regenerative farming project because the non-profit is the only one offering the “most advanced scientific methodology in soil carbon.” Jain said. However, he added that Varaha is not tied to any single registry and works with other leading standards including Puro and Isometric.\n“On the soil organic carbon side, none of Verra’s credits have been questioned so far by anyone,” he said.\nIn addition to cutting emissions, Varaha’s tech is intended to improve soil health, reduce water use, limit chemical inputs, raise crop yields, lower farming costs, and contribute to cleaner air. The startup also plans to develop dedicated programs for women farmers, aiming to strengthen gender inclusion within rural communities.\nVaraha’s worldwide reputation was helped by an agreement it signed earlier this year with Google, in what it described as the world’s largest biochar carbon removal deal. The tech giant will purchase 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide removal credits from the startup by 2030.\nVaraha’s investors include RTP Global, Omnivore, Orios Venture Partners, IMC Pan Asia Alliance Group’s Octave Wellbeing Economy Fund, and Japan’s Norinchukin Bank. The startup has raised $12.7 million in venture funding to date, including $8.7 million from a Series A round last year.\n"

    "body": "\nApple Watch and iPhone owners in the United States will now be able to carry a copy of their U.S. passport on their device, which they can then use at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 U.S. airports when traveling domestically.\nThe feature, known as Digital ID, was previously announced as part of the iOS 26 release, and adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet. The company has rolled out the feature to a dozen states and Puerto Rico, with more on the way.\nUsing Digital ID in Apple Wallet, users can create and present an ID, even if they don’t have a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID. The ID does not replace a physical passport, and it’s not currently supported for international travel or crossing borders, Apple notes.\nImage Credits:Apple\nUsers can add their passport to Wallet by tapping on the “Add” (+) button in the Wallet app, then selecting “Driver’s License or ID Cards.” From there, select Digital ID and follow the steps to complete the setup process, which includes using the iPhone to scan the photo page of their passport and scanning the chip embedded on the back to ensure the passport’s authenticity. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security.\nSupport for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more.\nPresenting Apple’s new Digital ID in person works much like using Apple Pay. You can double-click the side button or Home button to access your Wallet, then select Digital ID. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process.\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe feature is still in beta, as it hasn’t fully rolled out to all the device readers at the TSA checkpoints at this time. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online.\nThis could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they’re of drinking age. Online, websites that restrict content to adults could also leverage Apple’s APIs to verify users’ ages. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process.\nIn both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address, or birthday.\nApple said it can’t see when or where a user presents their ID or what data was shared. Plus, users don’t have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The company described the sites as “custom built for Anthropic with a focus on maximizing efficiency for our workloads.”\n“We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before,” Anthropic’s CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei (pictured above) said in a statement. “Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier.”\nBecause of the intense compute demands of Anthropic’s Claude family of models, the company is already engaged in significant cloud partnerships with both Google and Amazon (which is also an investor). But this is the company’s first major effort to build custom infrastructure. The $50 billion outlay, while large, is in line with the company’s internal revenue projections, which reportedly see Anthropic reaching $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in positive cash flow by 2028.\nWhile $50 billion represents a massive commitment in both cash and compute power, it is nonetheless dwarfed by similar projects from Anthropic’s competitors. Meta has committed to building $600 billion worth of data centers over the next three years, while the Stargate partnership between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle has already planned $500 billion in infrastructure spending. The spending has fueled concerns about an AI bubble due to flagging demand or even misallocated spending.\nThe project marks a major success for Fluidstack, a relatively young neocloud company that has become a vendor of choice in the AI building boom. Founded in 2017, the company was named in February as the primary partner for a 1 gigawatt AI project backed by the French government, which represented more than $11 billion in spending. According to Forbes, the company already has partnerships in place with Meta, Black Forest Labs, and France’s Mistral.\nFluidstack was also one of the first third-party vendors to receive Google’s custom-built TPUs, a major vote of confidence for the company.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a senior product manager at Google Labs, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”</p>\n<p>Opal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal. </p>\n<p>The tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork. </p>\n<p>Google also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.</p>\n<p>With the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

But these limits don’t apply to the dead, who can mostly be generated without roadblocks. The app, which is still only available via invite, has been flooded with videos of historical figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon, as well as deceased celebrities like Bob Ross, John Lennon, Alex Trebek, and yes, Robin Williams.</p>\n<p>How OpenAI draws the line on generating videos of the dead is unclear. Sora 2 won’t, for example, generate former President Jimmy Carter, who died in 2024, or Michael Jackson, who died in 2009, though it did create videos with the likeness of Robin Williams, who died in 2014, according to TechCrunch’s tests. And while OpenAI’s cameo feature allows people to set instructions for how they appear in videos others generate of them — guardrails that came in response to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">early criticism of Sora</a> — the deceased have no such say.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>British fintech <a href=\"http://revolut.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Revolut</a> — now launching in India — says cross-border payments remain one of India’s most underserved financial services. By its estimate, Indians spend about $30 billion overseas every year and lose around $600 million in bank charges — fees its India head calls “criminal.”</p>\n<p>“It has been the preserve of banks,” Paroma Chatterjee, Revolut India CEO, told TechCrunch. “You go to your bank to take currency, foreign exchange out from your bank, or you take a travel card that is issued by your bank when you’re traveling overseas … there have been humongous charges which have been levied on this.”</p>\n<p>Since 2021, Revolut has been working toward its India launch, aiming to fill what it sees as gaps in the country’s foreign exchange and traditional payments spaces. The London-headquartered fintech <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/en-US/news/revolut_acquires_indian_forex_business_as_it_advances_multi_million_dollar_india_expansion_plan/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired Arvog Forex</a> in 2022 to obtain a license and offer remittance and multi-currency account services in India. In April this year, it also <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/en-IN/news/revolut_receives_full_authorisation_from_rbi_to_issue_domestic_prepaid_cards_and_wallets_in_india/\" target=\"_blank\">secured a prepaid payment instrument (PPI) license</a> from the Reserve Bank of India, allowing it to issue prepaid cards, support digital wallets and integrate with the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI).</p>\n<p>With these regulatory approvals, Revolut aims to challenge traditional banks in India and compete with existing fintech players. The British startup is targeting more than 150 million “globally aspiring, digitally native” Indians aged between 25 and 45, with plans to onboard about 20 million users by 2030 and process at least $7 billion worth of their transactions.</p>\n<p>Chatterjee said that such regulatory approvals — including the PPI license — allows the fintech to offer a more differentiated experience than players that rely on bank partnerships. “We can deliver the kind of customer experience that we want to deliver,” she said.</p>\n<p>Revolut will offer Indian consumers a prepaid wallet with UPI support and its own branded UPI handles, along with a domestic Visa card and an international multi-currency Visa card. It will also introduce dedicated kids and teens accounts linked to parents’ profiles, a subscription-based model, and budgeting and analytics tools that provide insights into spending habits.</p>\n<p>Notably, the startup has regulatory permissions to enable both domestic and international payments and transfers through its platform. It also has authorization to enable same-day remittances from India through a local bank partner.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Unlike many Indian fintech players that use minimum know-your-customer (KYC) checks to quickly onboard users for limited, low-value transactions, Revolut will offer only full-KYC wallets. The fintech will also verify new users against global sanctions lists, including those maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United Nations. This approach, Chatterjee said, is aimed at attracting “high-intent customers” who are willing to complete a more detailed onboarding process, including Aadhaar and video verification.</p>\n<p>“Somebody would do that only if they’re interested in using the product. So, this full KYC customer onboarded is going to be my customer metric,” she noted.</p>\n<p>“In a country like India, once you list yourself on the App Store, sheer curiosity drives downloads,” she said. “That’s not our metric of success.”</p>\n<p>The fintech also aims to measure its success in India by the depth of user engagement and profitability and not merely increasing its user base.</p>\n<p>“There are people who talk about having 300–400 million customers,” Chatterjee told TechCrunch. “Revolut globally in 39 countries has 65 million customers, and it is valued at $75 billion. The reason is that from these 65 million customers, Revolut is processing more than $4 billion worth of transactions and delivering more than a billion dollars worth of profit. And that is because out of those 65 million customers in any given month, more than 25 million customers are active.”</p>\n<p>She’s referring to the the new valuation Revolut <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/revolut-valuation-jumps-75bn-staff-set-for-payout-opportunity\">announced last month</a> on the back of a secondary share sale, that boosted it from $45 billion last summer. </p>\n<p>Revolut already has a waitlist of more than 350,000 people in India, she also said, which it plans to onboard by later this year before opening the app to new users. The exact launch timeline, however, will depend on how quickly the company clears the waitlist and customers complete their KYC and anti–money laundering (AML) checks.</p>\n<p>The startup is also exploring partners other than Visa, including the Indian government’s RuPay, as it ramps up the product to provide customers with a choice of networks.</p>\n<p>Revolut has <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ukinindia_british-fintech-company-revolut-is-preparing-activity-7377279905585307648-1e5i/\" target=\"_blank\">already infused $45 million</a> in India to kickstart its operations and to localize its entire tech stack to conform to the country’s data sovereignty regulations. It plans to invest more as it begins its operations, Chatterjee said.</p>\n<p>Of Revolut’s 10,000 employees worldwide, about 3,500 are already based in India — its largest workforce globally, even bigger than in its home market of the U.K. Some of these employees also work on the products and features available in markets outside India.</p>\n<p>But as significant as Revolut’s plans are, it will still face competition once it arrives. While foreign exchange is dominated by banks in India, fintech players such as Niyo, Scapia, Fi, and BookMyForex are already active in India’s cross-border and remittance market.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy is looking to cut billions more in federal funding, and many promising startups as well as automakers Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis could be affected by the Trump administration’s decision.</p>\n<p>The proposed cuts would cancel more than $500 million of contracts awarded to more than a dozen startups, according to a TechCrunch analysis of an internal document that has not become public yet. All of the proposed cuts are grants that had been awarded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The proposed cancellations, many of which have not been reported before, come on top of more than $7.5 billion in contracts the Trump administration said it would cut <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/department-of-energy-cancels-7-5b-of-clean-energy-projects-in-mostly-blue-states/\">last week</a>.</p>\n<p>Startups might not be the only losers. Other companies slated to lose grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars include Daimler Trucks North America, Ford, General Motors, Harley-Davidson, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Stellantis, and Volvo Technology of America, according to the document viewed by TechCrunch. Sources confirmed with TechCrunch these are proposed cuts. </p>\n<p>General Motors could lose at least <a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-investments-gms-lansing-grand-river-assembly-underscore\" target=\"_blank\">$500 million in grant money</a> issued from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. The money was going to be used to retool the Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. The automaker announced in July 2024 it planned to produce electrified vehicles, including hybrids, at the plant.</p>\n<p>Some of the awards are significant and, if cut, will undoubtedly affect the startups’ operations. Several were included in a list of proposed cuts that leaked last week, but many are new and have yet to be announced. TechCrunch has reached out to several of the companies and will update this article if they reply.</p>\n<p>Two awards on the chopping block topped $100 million, including a $189 million award granted to materials startup Brimstone. Those funds would have helped the company build a plant to produce Portland cement, alumina, and other materials using less carbon dioxide. </p>\n<p>The other went to Anovion, a Chicago-based startup that is working to build a factory to produce a domestic supply of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries. Currently, Chinese companies dominate the graphite market.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Battery materials startup Li Industries received $55.2 million under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to recycle LFP batteries in an attempt to wrest part of that supply chain from China.</p>\n<p>Other cement startups are on the list, too. Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime Systems was given an award for $86.9 million to build an ultra-low-carbon cement plant. Mountain View-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/cement-startup-furno-lands-20m-grant-to-build-low-carbon-micro-kilns-in-chicago/\">Furno</a>, which is making a novel, modular cement kiln, would lose its $20 million grant to build a demonstration plant in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Several building materials companies were also on the list. CleanFiber and Hempitecture, which make insulation for homes and commercial buildings, are at risk of losing $10 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Skyven Technologies, which makes industrial heat pumps, and Luxwall, which makes super-insulated windows, would lose $15 million and $31 million, respectively. </p>\n<p>At least one of the proposed cancelations seemingly cuts against the administration’s goals of energy and AI dominance. TS Conductor, which could lose $28.2 million in grant money, makes advanced conductors for electric lines that promise to double or triple capacity on existing transmission lines. The technology could reduce bottlenecks on the grid and improve data centers’ likelihood of receiving power sooner.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

When you first sign up for an account on a new platform, you may not know who to follow and aren’t sure who might be posting about topics of interest.</p>\n<p>Bluesky tried to solve this problem <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/bluesky-lets-you-curate-accounts-and-feeds-to-follow-with-its-starter-pack-feature/\">with Starter Packs</a>, a feature that lets everyday users curate a collection of suggested follows. Today, you can find Starter Packs focused <a href=\"https://blueskystarterpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on nearly any topic</a>, as well as those that feature top users on the app or other sorts of recommendations.</p>\n<p>The idea was so popular that Meta late last year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/metas-threads-is-developing-its-own-take-on-blueskys-starter-packs/\">implemented</a> a similar feature on its X competitor, Instagram Threads. </p>\n<p>Now, Mastodon says it’s <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/10/our-ideas-about-packs/\" target=\"_blank\">ready to do the same</a>, but with some key differences.</p>\n<p>Mastodon believes that users should have control over whether or not they will appear in Packs on Mastodon. It suggests making Packs an extension of the service’s existing account discoverability features. That means to opt out of Packs, you would disable the setting “Feature profile and posts in discoverability algorithms.”</p>\n<p>In addition, users will be notified when they’re included in a Pack. On Bluesky, a user who wanted to be removed from a Starter Pack would have to report the pack or block the user who made it. Mastodon says it aims to offer a simpler mechanism to remove themselves from Packs, similar to how it allows users to remove their posts from the newly launched Quote Posts. </p>\n<p>The nonprofit developing the Mastodon software, Mastodon gGmbH, is collaborating with other fediverse developers on a <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP)</a>, which is now on <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. It says the initial version of Packs and other onboarding improvements should be available in the Mastodon 4.6 release.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After AMD and OpenAI announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded partnership on Monday</a>, the <a href=\"https://x.com/litcapital/status/1975402366611378538\" target=\"_blank\">chatter</a> immediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. </p>\n<p>To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. </p>\n<p>But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 apiece, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\">AMD disclosed</a>. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement.  </p>\n<p>If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about $100 billion.  </p>\n<p>“We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases.  </p>\n<p>Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and institutional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. </p>\n<p>In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investment <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">announced last month</a>. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. </p>\n<p>But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% market share, USB estimates — into one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">biggest build-outs</a> of next-generation data centers the world has ever seen.  </p>\n<p>While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.” </p>\n</div>"

Already, the startup has plans to bring its storefront to markets including Australia, Brazil, and Japan this year.

While the startup offers its own third-party apps, led by video game emulator <a href=\"https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta\" target=\"_blank\">Delta</a>, it began adding other third-party apps in June 2024. This included the virtual machine app UTM, a move that pressured Apple to open its own App Store to allow virtual machines.</p>\n<p>AltStore also partnered with Epic Games in August of last year to bring Fortnite and other mobile games to its EU storefront, AltStore PAL. The company also entered the adult app market this year with the decision to host an app called Hot Tub, which was the first iOS app for pornography and is now its top app.</p>\n<p>In April, AltStore began allowing developers to self-publish their apps for free on AltStore PAL, prompting further growth. </p>\n<p>AltStore’s founders told TechCrunch that the store now has over 100 developers on board, which is more than Epic Games offers on its alternative games store, for comparison. AltStore, which is not limited to games, attracts a variety of developers, including indies who want to put out apps more as well as those who wouldn’t meet Apple’s stricter requirements, like its adult content restrictions.</p>\n<p>Plus, developers like that the store supports different types of business models, whether that’s a more traditional subscription or something where users donate toward the app’s development, for instance.</p>\n<p>“We have hundreds of thousands of users,” AltStore co-founder Testut told TechCrunch in an interview. “Wonderful and good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Now, alongside the additional funding, AltStore is launching its <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/n5KGCN7r8rsMQ7Z8CmfrtysOPW?domain=explore.alt.store\" target=\"_blank\">own Mastodon server,</a> running on the ActivityPub protocol, where users will be able to view app updates and new information from the sources they follow. Developers can opt in to have their app updates published to the new server.</p>\n<p>“That means, if you have a Mastodon account or a Threads account, you could follow these accounts. You could follow the source from our Mastodon server. Then, in your timeline, you’d see when there was an app update,” explains Testut.</p>\n<p>Once opted in, these updates will be automated by way of a JSON file with metadata. And this will output whatever is in the AltStore to the fediverse. </p>\n<p>“It’s adding a social layer,” said Testut. “People can reply to apps from their Mastodon account. They can like stuff from their Threads account.” (Plus, the plan is to bridge the service with the open social ecosystem on Bluesky, using tools from the nonprofit, A New Social.)</p>\n<p>The service will also help with discoverability, as users can look to the server and the accounts it hosts to find apps they may want to try.  </p>\n<p>With the additional funds, AltStore wants to give back to the ecosystem that will make its social network possible. </p>\n<p>To that end, it’s giving back $500,000 to various projects in the fediverse. So far, it’s donated to Mastodon gGmbH ($300,000), as well as Bridgy Fed by A New Social, Ivory + Phoenix by Tapbots, Tapestry by The Iconfactory, mstdn.social, Akkoma, PeerTube, BookWyrm, and Fedify.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p><br />Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang isn’t satisfied with the company being viewed, and used, as just a meeting notetaker. Liang wants Otter.ai to become a go-to source for enterprises and a new batch of products released Tuesday is the first step in that evolution. </p>\n<p>The Silicon Valley-based AI meeting assistant startup on Tuesday released a new suite of tools for enterprises designed to better incorporate data from meetings into other workflows by funneling that information to a central knowledge base. The aim is to grow Otter’s business by helping companies get more out of the meetings they record.</p>\n<p>Otter’s new product suite includes an API that allows users to build custom integrations with platforms like Jira and HubSpot, an MCP server — which connects users’ Otter data to external AI models — and a new AI agent that can search a company’s meetings notes or presentations.  </p>\n<p>Liang told TechCrunch it is the next phase of Otter’s life.  </p>\n<p>“We are evolving from a meeting notetaker to a corporate meeting knowledge base,” Liang said. “This is a system record for conversations. It can help corporations scale their growth and drive measurable business value.” </p>\n<p>When Otter was founded in 2016, there were just a handful of meeting transcription companies — a far leap from today. The AI boom that kicked off in 2022 fueled a surge in startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Granola</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/yc-backed-circleback-is-out-to-become-the-best-meeting-notetaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Circleback</a>. Even older players like Fireflies have seen a <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai/blog/fireflies-1-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">surge in interest</a>.  </p>\n<p>Liang argues this transition puts Otter into a separate division than its former peers.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meetings are where the majority of company knowledge is stored, in Liang’s opinion, whether that is notes from a customer sales call or discussions around a marketing strategy. But without a centralized place for these meeting notes, that information can only help a company so much.  </p>\n<p>“A lot of times, inefficiency happens because of information silos,” Liang said. “One team doesn’t know what the other team is doing, and it thinks that that was planned like a month ago. Oftentimes the plan changes, but not everybody is informed. So, the idea is to create a permission system so that you know most of the [nonconfidential] information is shared as broadly as possible.” </p>\n<p>Not every meeting with Otter will be directly added to this companywide knowledge base, and users can choose to restrict meeting note access for recordings that deal with sensitive information.  </p>\n<p>Employee and information privacy remains a concern despite access controls. Even if a meeting is around a neutral topic, Otter transcriptions pick the small talk and chatter that happens before and after meetings, which could contain gossip or information meant for only certain participants to hear.  </p>\n<p>Otter is also the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/g-s1-83087/otter-ai-transcription-class-action-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">August class-action lawsuit</a> that claims the company was recording private conversations without user consent and using that information to train its transcription services. </p>\n<p>Liang said that while he can’t comment on the lawsuit specifically, this isn’t an issue specific to Otter, and that when looking at the bigger picture, more access to information is better than not.  </p>\n<p>“If they accuse us, then they could accuse everyone else, all the tools you heard about doing meeting notes,” Liang said. “My view is that we are on the right side of history. We’re building this new AI revolution. If you want AI to help, you need to put AI in the meetings.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

Other thefts are likely unreported and remain unknown,” said Elliptic. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1200,627 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1280,669 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=720,376 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=900,471 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=800,418 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=2048,1071 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=668,349 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1180,617 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=708,370 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=50,26 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Elliptic</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The company said that North Korea’s main targets are still crypto exchanges, but the regime’s hackers are also starting to target “high-net-worth individuals,” who own large amounts of crypto.  </p>\n<p>And that’s not the only recent change, the company said.  </p>\n<p>“The majority of the hacks in 2025 have been perpetrated through social engineering attacks, where hackers deceive or manipulate individuals in order to gain access to cryptocurrency,” read the blog post. “This marks a shift from earlier attacks where in many cases technical flaws in crypto infrastructure were exploited to steal funds.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Indian government’s tax authority has fixed a security flaw in its income tax filing portal that was exposing sensitive taxpayers’ data, TechCrunch has exclusively learned and confirmed with authorities.</p>\n<p>The flaw, discovered in September by a pair of security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral,” allowed anyone who was logged into the <a href=\"https://www.incometax.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\">income tax department’s e-Filing portal</a> to access up-to-date personal and financial data of other people.</p>\n<p>The exposed data included full names, home addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and bank account details of people who pay taxes on their income in India. The data also exposed citizens’ Aadhaar number, a unique government-issued identifier used as proof of identity and for accessing government services.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch verified the data to the best of its ability by granting permission to the researchers to look up this reporter’s records on the portal.</p>\n<p>The security researchers confirmed to TechCrunch on October 2 that the vulnerability was fixed. Given the risk to the public, TechCrunch withheld publishing this story until the security researchers confirmed that the vulnerability can no longer be exploited.</p>\n<p>Representatives for the Indian Income Tax Department acknowledged our email requesting comment, but did not answer our questions by press time. The Income Tax Department did not present any objections to our publishing this story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-extremely-low-hanging-bug-granted-access-to-sensitive-data\">‘Extremely low-hanging’ bug granted access to sensitive data</h2>\n<p>The security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral” told TechCrunch that they discovered the vulnerability while filing their recent income tax return on the government website.</p>\n<p>Residents of India are required to file their annual earnings to calculate the taxes they owe to the Indian government.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that when they signed into the portal using their Permanent Account Number (PAN), an official document issued by the Indian income tax department, they could view anyone else’s sensitive financial data by swapping out their PAN for another PAN in the network request as the web page loads.</p>\n<p>This could be done using publicly available tools like Postman or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">Burp Suite</a> (or using the web browser’s in-built developer tools) and with knowledge of someone else’s PAN, the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The bug was exploitable by anyone who was logged-in to the tax portal because the Indian income tax department’s back-end servers were not properly checking who was allowed to access a person’s sensitive data. This class of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common and simple flaw that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\" target=\"_blank\">governments have warned is easy to exploit</a> and can result in large-scale data breaches.</p>\n<p>“This is an extremely low-hanging thing, but one that has a very severe consequence,” the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to the data of individuals, the researchers said that the bug also exposed data associated with companies who were registered with the e-Filing portal.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch also verified that the bug exposed data on individuals who have yet to file their income tax returns this year. We confirmed this by asking a person who had not yet filed their tax returns for their permission to have the researchers look up their information using the portal bug.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-cert-in-acknowledges-security-flaw\">CERT-In acknowledges security flaw</h2>\n<p>The security researchers alerted India’s computer emergency readiness team, or CERT-In, to the security flaw soon after their discovery, but were not provided with a timeline for the fix.</p>\n<p>When contacted by TechCrunch on September 30, a CERT-In representative said the Income Tax Department was already working to fix the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The Indian Ministry of Finance did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The scourge of modern concrete is, perhaps surprisingly, rust. </p>\n<p>Most concrete structures are laced with steel rebar to add strength, but if the metal corrodes, it can cause the concrete to fail prematurely. Bridges, which are exposed to water and salt, are some of the most vulnerable. About one third of bridges in the United States need to be <a href=\"https://infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/bridges-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\">repaired or replaced</a>, which could cost nearly $400 billion over the next decade.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of ways engineers cope with rust, from coating the rebar with epoxy to pouring extra concrete to buy some time before seeping water reaches the rebar. Eventually these measures fail, too. The only way to truly prevent problematic rust is to use stainless steel rebar, which isn’t cheap.</p>\n<p>“It’s too expensive to be used in every bridge,” Steven Jepeal, co-founder and CEO at <a href=\"https://alliumeng.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Allium Engineering</a>, told TechCrunch. So cities and states will only turn to it for the most critical spans.</p>\n<p>But Allium is proposing a compromise, of sorts, by covering regular rebar with a thin layer of stainless steel to prolong the intended life of a bridge from 30 to 100 years. </p>\n<p>“As long as we’re getting full coverage of the surface, a thin layer is enough stainless steel to where it’s going to resist corrosion for hundreds or thousands of years,” said Samuel McAlpine, co-founder and CTO at Allium.</p>\n<p>The startup’s stainless steel-layered rebar was recently used in a bridge deck replacement on U.S. Highway 101 in Mendocino County, California, and another is planned for Interstate 91 in Massachusetts. It also contributed to a commercial boat yard in Key West, Florida, Allium exclusively told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>For critical bridges that carry lots of traffic, engineers sometimes specify stainless steel, which costs around five times more than regular rebar. Governments consider the added costs are worth it if they don’t have to shut down a major artery. </p>\n<p>But for most other bridges, they tend to specify epoxy-coated rebar, which is only about <a href=\"https://www.epoxyinterestgroup.org/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">25% to 50%</a> more than uncoated rebar. Epoxy-coated rebar needs to be housed in covered storage, and any welded spots or nicks in the coating need to be patched, both of which add additional indirect costs.</p>\n<p>Allium is pitching its stainless-clad rebar as a replacement for epoxy-coated. The company aims to match the price of epoxy coating and possibly undercut it in the future. Jepeal said, when installed, Allium’s rebar should cost less because it doesn’t need to be handled as carefully. The startup’s rebar also won’t need additional concrete that is sometimes added to bridges to forestall rusting.</p>\n<p>“This extra layer of concrete isn’t structural. It’s just meant to try to insulate the rebar and delay how long it takes for the salt to get to the rebar,” Jepeal said. Eliminating that could trim cement use by up to 20%. And because the rebar isn’t as susceptible to corrosion, it should allow transportation departments to specify the use of greener cements, which tend to be less alkaline than standard mixes, McAlpine said.</p>\n<p>Allium’s process clads 7,000-pound billets of steel with a layer of stainless steel, essentially welding wires to the exterior until it’s fully coated. That billet, which is typically between six to eight inches square and 40 feet long, is then fed through a series of rollers until it reaches the desired thickness, which ranges from about a third of an inch to a couple inches in diameter. </p>\n<p>“By cladding a smaller surface area with a thicker layer and integrating into the mills process, we can do something that’s a lot cheaper, a lot more scalable, a lot easier to control the quality of,” Jepeal said.</p>\n<p>As the billet is getting thinned out, growing up to 150 times longer in the process, the stainless steel does as well. Ultimately, each piece of rebar ends up with about 0.2 mm of stainless cladding.</p>\n<p>Even with that small amount, “you’re not going to corrode through that stainless steel in concrete, basically,” McAlpine said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

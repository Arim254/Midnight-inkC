    "body": "\nRivian is reportedly cutting another 600 workers in its third layoff of the year, or about 4% of its total workforce, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThe company previously made cuts of around 100 to 150 workers in September and June to its commercial and manufacturing teams, respectively. Rivian declined to comment on what teams are affected by this new round of layoffs. \nThe cuts come as Rivian is prepping to launch its all-important mass-market model, the R2 SUV, in 2026. The company plans to make as many as 150,000 of those EVs per year at its factory in Normal, Illinois. Rivian also recently broke ground on a brand new factory outside of Atlanta, where it plans to build more R2s and other variants.\nUntil R2 hits the road, though, Rivian is struggling to keep up the pace of sales with its current lineup. Its current best-case guess for total delivery figures at the end of 2025 would represent a 16% drop from last year’s sales. \n"

    "body": "\nAmazon on Thursday unveiled its revamped game streaming service, Amazon Luna, which now includes new beginner-friendly multiplayer games that can be controlled with your phone. Amazon Luna is available at no extra cost for Prime members.\nThe biggest change to the service is the addition of GameNight, a collection of more than 25 local multiplayer games that Amazon says are “designed to bring friends and family together in the living room.” \nGameNight will feature exclusive titles developed by Amazon Game Studios, starting with “Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg,” an AI voice-driven improv courtroom game where players invent absurd characters, spin wild stories, and try to defend their testimonies in front of Judge Snoop Dogg. \nOther titles in GameNight include “Angry Birds Flock Party,” “Draw & Guess,” The Jackbox Party Pack 9,” “Ticket to Ride,” “Exploding Kittens 2,” “Clue,” “Tetris Effect: Connected,” and more. \nBy adding a library of multiplayer games that users can play with their phones, Amazon likely hopes that Prime members will turn to Luna for their next hangout or game night. \n“GameNight takes even further the idea of easy access that’s core to the new Luna, delivering a collection of incredibly fun and approachable games that absolutely shine when played together with friends and family,” says Jeff Gattis, general manager of Amazon Luna, in a press release. “Anyone with a smartphone can dive right in and have a blast, regardless of their gaming abilities.”\nLuna also includes access to new titles like “Hogwarts Legacy,” “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,” “Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,” “TopSpin 2K25,” and more blockbusters, popular classics, and indie games. As before the revamp, these games (and all games outside of the GameNight library) require a controller or mouse and keyboard to play.\nPlayers who want access to a larger library of games can subscribe to Luna Premium, previously called Luna+, for $9.99 a month. Premium includes access to titles like “EA SPORTS FC 25,” “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor,” and “Batman: Arkham Knight.”\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWith the AI infrastructure push reaching staggering proportions, there’s more pressure than ever to squeeze as much inference as possible out of the GPUs they have. And for researchers with expertise in a particular technique, it’s a great time to raise funding.\nThat’s part of the driving force behind Tensormesh, launching out of stealth this week with $4.5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Laude Ventures, with additional angel funding from database pioneer Michael Franklin.\nTensormesh is using the money to build a commercial version of the open-source LMCache utility, launched and maintained by Tensormesh co-founder Yihua Cheng. Used well, LMCache can reduce inference costs by as much as ten times — a power that’s made it a staple in open-source deployments and drawn in integrations from heavy-hitters like Google and Nvidia. Now, Tensormesh is planning to parlay that academic reputation into a viable business.\nThe heart of the key-value cache (or KV cache), a memory system used to process complex inputs more efficiently by condensing them down to their key values. In traditional architectures, the KV cache is discarded at the end of each query — but TensorMesh CEO Juchen Jiang argues that this is an enormous source of inefficiency.\n“It’s like having a very smart analyst reading all the data, but they forget what they have learned after each question,” says Tensormesh co-founder Junchen Jiang.\nInstead of discarding that cache, Tensormesh’s systems hold onto it, allowing it to be redeployed when the model executes a similar process in a separate query. Because GPU memory is so precious, this can mean spreading data across several different storage layers, but the reward is significantly more inference power for the same server load.\nThe change is particularly powerful for chat interfaces, since models need to continually refer back to the growing chat log as the conversation progresses. Agentic systems have a similar issue, with a growing log of actions and goals.\nIn theory, these are changes AI companies can execute on their own — but the technical complexity makes it a daunting task. Given the Tensormesh team’s work researching the process and the intricacy of the detail itself, the company is betting there will be lots of demand for an out-of-the-box product.\n“Keeping the KV cache in a secondary storage system and reused efficiently without slowing the whole system down is a very challenging problem,” says Jiang. “We’ve seen people hire 20 engineers and spend three or four months to build such a system. Or they can use our product and do it very efficiently.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nGoogle said today that it will invest in a natural gas power plant in Illinois that intends to capture the majority of its carbon emissions.\nThe 400-megawatt power plant will be built outside of Decatur next to an ethanol plant run by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which already captures CO2 from its operations. Google will buy most of the electricity to power its nearby data centers, while ADM will use some of the power plant’s steam and electricity. Low Carbon Infrastructure is developing the new project.  \nGoogle intends to capture “approximately 90%” of the CO2 generated by the power plant, the company said.\nCarbon dioxide from Google’s power plant will be injected into the same geological storage formations already used by ADM’s ethanol facility. The site is the location of the first long-term CO2 storage well in the U.S.\nTypically, around 2,000 metric tons of CO2 are sent into the well every day. But injections there were halted in 2024 when salty brine, which stores dissolved CO2 deep underground, was found to have migrated into “unauthorized zones,” according to the EPA. ADM said the leak was the result of corrosion at a monitoring well, E&E News reported, and they’ve since resumed injections.\nWhile carbon capture and storage (CCS) shows great promise at reducing carbon emissions from coal and natural gas power plants, it has a mixed record in the field. \nA recent study of 13 CCS facilities representing 55% of all captured carbon shows that most aren’t living up to expectations. An ExxonMobil facility in Wyoming, which processes natural gas, has been capturing 36% less than expected. The most analogous to Google’s project, a 115-megawatt power plant in Canada, has only captured about 50% what it had promised.\nCCS, when it works, can help mitigate pollution from burning natural gas to generate power, but it won’t do anything to address the methane leaks that occur throughout the natural gas supply chain. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, generating 84 times more warming over 20 years than carbon dioxide.\nAs a result, leaks can significantly change the carbon accounting. With leakage rates of just 2%, burning natural gas unabated puts it on par with coal. Capturing the carbon will reduce that figure, but it can’t eliminate the warming generated by extracting and transporting natural gas.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLondon-based AI creative studio Wonder Studios has raised $12 million in seed funding to scale production amid a push to bring AI-generated content into the entertainment industry. \nThe round was led by Atomico, alongside existing investors LocalGlobe and Blackbird, and builds on Wonder’s pre-seed investment, which included executives from ElevenLabs, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI. \nWonder will use the fresh funds to double its engineering team and accelerate its push into IP ownership and original content production. The team recently produced an AI music video for Lewis Capaldi’s ‘Something in the Heavens’, created with DeepMind, YouTube, and Universal Music Group. Wonder also released its first original production, the “Beyond the Loop” anthology series.\nWonder is working on several commercial and original projects for release next year, including an upcoming documentary with Campfire Studios, the production company behind Netflix documentaries “The Menendez Brothers” and “America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.” Campfire’s CEO Ross Dinerstein is an investor in the startup.\nThe drive for IP ownership emerges amid a wave of legal actions from Hollywood producers targeting AI companies — both for training models on their content and for generating outputs featuring copyrighted characters. Disney and Universal Studios, for example, have sued Chinese company MiniMax, as well as AI image generator Midjourney.\nWonder’s raise also comes as Netflix goes “all in” on generative AI as a way to make creatives more efficient at storytelling. \nAI remains a divisive issue in entertainment, with artists concerned that tools powered by LLMs, which have often been trained on their work without consent, could threaten their livelihoods. OpenAI’s Sora 2 has come under particular criticism for reproducing actors’ likenesses without notice or consent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWonder positions itself as “Hollywood without borders,” helping to make AI storytelling tools accessible to all creators. The startup’s app serves as a hub connecting its community of creators with career opportunities, collaborators, and resources, according to the company. \n“The next decade will define what creativity looks like in the age of AI,” said Justin Hackney, chief commercial officer and co-founder of Wonder Studios. “Our mission is to ensure that this future belongs to the storytellers. Working with leading studios, industry pioneers, and grassroots filmmakers, we’re already creating a bridge where technology and artistry grow together.” \nClarification: A previous headline misstated OpenAI’s involvement in Wonder Studios. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nSnapchat is making its new “Imagine Lens,” the company’s first open prompt image-generation AI Lens, available to all users for free. The Lens was initially launched in September but only for paid subscribers. With the Lens, users can edit their own Snaps using custom prompts or generate their own.\nFor instance, you could prompt the app, “Turn me into an alien” after snapping a selfie, or request an image of a “grumpy cat.” The company suggests you could use the Lens to try on Halloween costume ideas, or reimagine your friend in a new look, among other things.\nThe results can be shared with friends, posted to your Story on Snapchat, or shared beyond the app. \nThe broadened availability of the AI Lens follows the launch of AI video-generating apps from Meta (Meta AI) and OpenAI (Sora), which compete for young people’s attention with even more advanced AI tools and features than photo modifications. \nFor instance, Sora lets users generate videos of themselves after providing the app with a one-time video and audio recording to capture their appearance. Friends can share these AI personas, dubbed “cameos,” with one another, so they can star in videos together.\nThat puts pressure on other social apps like Snapchat to keep up, so making the AI image Lens free to use seems a worthwhile investment for the app maker. \nUntil now, Snapchat’s AI Lens was only available to Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum Subscribers, the company says. With the expanded rollout, Snap is making a limited number of image generations available to all free users, as well. At launch, free users in the U.S. will be able to access the new Lens, with plans for other markets underway, starting with Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Lens is found near the front of the in-app Lens Carousel, or you can search for it by name.

The family first filed a wrongful death suit against OpenAI in August after alleging their son had taken his own life following conversations with the chatbot about his mental health and suicidal ideation. The updated lawsuit claims that OpenAI rushed GPT-4o’s May 2024 release by cutting safety testing due to competitive pressure.\nThe suit also claims that in February 2025, OpenAI weakened protections by removing suicide prevention from its “disallowed content” list, instead only advising the AI to “take care in risky situations.” The family argued that after this change, Adam’s ChatGPT usage surged from dozens of daily chats, with 1.6% containing self-harm content in January, to 300 daily chats in April, the month he died, with 17% containing such content. \nIn a response to the amended lawsuit, OpenAI said: “Teen wellbeing is a top priority for us — minors deserve strong protections, especially in sensitive moments. We have safeguards in place today, such as [directing to] crisis hotlines, rerouting sensitive conversations to safer models, nudging for breaks during long sessions, and we’re continuing to strengthen them.” \nOpenAI recently began rolling out a new safety routing system and parental controls on ChatGPT. The routing system pushes more emotionally sensitive conversations to OpenAI’s newer model, GPT-5, which doesn’t have the same sycophantic tendencies as GPT-4o. And the parental controls allow parents to receive safety alerts in limited situations where the teen is potentially in danger of self-harm. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and the Raine family attorney.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. government has accused a former executive at defense contractor L3Harris of stealing trade secrets and selling them to a buyer in Russia, according to court documents seen by TechCrunch. \nOn October 14, the Department of Justice accused Peter Williams of stealing eight trade secrets from two unnamed companies. The DOJ made the allegation in a “criminal information” document, which, like an indictment, represents a formal accusation of alleged crimes.  \nThe document does not specify Williams’ relationship with the two companies, specify the types of trade secrets, nor name the alleged Russian buyer. \nTechCrunch has confirmed that the Williams mentioned in the document, which does not specify where he worked, is the former general manager at Trenchant, a division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for Western governments, including the United States.  \nWilliams became Trenchant’s general manager on October 23, 2024, and he worked at Trenchant until August 21, 2025, per U.K. business records. Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen, resided in Washington D.C., according to the court document.  \nFour former Trenchant employees had previously told TechCrunch that Williams, who was known inside the company as “Doogie,” had been arrested.  \nA spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday that Williams is not currently in federal custody. \nThe DOJ accused Williams of stealing seven trade secrets between April 2022 and June 2025, and the eighth trade secret between June and August 6, 2025. \nAccording to the criminal information document, the U.S. government alleged Williams made $1.3 million for the sale of the trade secrets. For that reason, the DOJ seeks to forfeit Williams’ property derived from his alleged crimes.  \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools?

    "body": "\nOpenAI is teasing a series of updates coming to its viral app for AI-generated videos, Sora, which recently shot to the top of the App Store after a late September launch. The app, which remains at No. 1 in the U.S. and Canada, will introduce video editing tools, offer the ability for users to create character “cameos” of pets and other objects, improve social features, and more. Plus, the company says the Android version of the app is “actually coming soon.”\nThe announcement was made on X by Sora head Bill Peebles, who says the new creation tools will arrive in the next few days. These include the ability to turn pets and other items, like a “favorite stuffed toy and pretty much anything else,” into cameos.\n\nsora roadmap update: in the spirit of building this app openly, here's what we're landing soon.first, more creation tools. character cameos are coming in the next few days: you'll be able to cameo your dog, guinea pig, favorite stuffed toy, and pretty much anything else you… pic.twitter.com/GX7CJXWRcZ— Bill Peebles (@billpeeb) October 22, 2025\n\nThe term “cameo” refers to the Sora feature where users can make AI personas of themselves after providing the app with a recorded video as a reference file. These cameos can be shared with friends and others, allowing them to make videos with your AI character.\n“We’re expecting people to register lots of crazy new cameos with this feature. To make them easier to find, we’re updating the generation UI to show the latest trending cameos in real time,” Peebles wrote on X.\nIn addition, he says the app will introduce basic video editing features, starting with stitching together multiple clips. More tools will be added over time. An updated social experience is also underway, which would add new ways of using Sora with friends. These may include dedicated channels specific to a university, company, sports club, and more.\nThe company says it’s working to reduce the excessive moderation of generations, which some users have complained is too strict, and improve the overall app performance. \nThough the app is currently listed on the Google Play Store for pre-registration, OpenAI hasn’t yet shared a launch date for its arrival.

    "body": "\nPalantir said on Thursday it had struck a partnership with Lumen Technologies that will see the telecommunications company using the data management company’s AI software to build capabilities to support enterprise AI services.\nThe companies are calling the deal “a multi-year, multi-million-dollar strategic partnership,” but Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources, that Lumen is going to spend over $200 million on Palantir’s tech over the course of several years.\nThe agreement will see Lumen pairing Palantir’s Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) with its own edge computing, broadband infrastructure, and other digital services.\nThe partnership comes as Lumen tries to transform itself from a traditional telecom provider into a more modern tech infrastructure play. The company in September said it was “collaborating” with Palantir to integrate the latter’s Foundry and AI software and services into its operations, finance, and technology functions, “to transform its network and services with speed.”\nWhile Lumen would not confirm the deal value, its spokesperson Joe Goode told TechCrunch in an email that the company’s use of Palantir’s tech was a “material contributor” to achieving $350 million in cost reductions in 2025. He added that what the companies learned during that collaboration informed their decision to take their partnership to the enterprise market. Lumen has committed to reducing expenses by $1 billion by 2027, and it says it’s already ahead of plan.\n“Palantir demonstrated that its Foundry and AIP platforms could unlock Lumen’s data faster and cheaper than traditional data-lake migrations, and together we’re pursuing solutions to help large enterprises do the same,” Goode said.\nFor Palantir, this is the latest in a long string of deals for which it has partnered up with companies and government organizations of all stripes to sell its AI products and services. Including the Lumen deal, Palantir has struck 19 partnerships this year alone, across aviation, healthcare, telecom, contract management, data management, defense, and more sectors.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“By bringing AI into real-world operations through a connected ecosystem, we’re empowering businesses to reinvent how they operate, compete, and grow,” Kate Johnson, CEO of Lumen Technologies, said in a statement.\nPalantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Hundreds of companies are pitching similar products, so why do we care about Cluely? What really sets Lee apart is his mastery of attention. In an era when most startups fight to be noticed, Lee has made rage-baiting social media content his business model.\nLee originally went viral as a Columbia University student who got in trouble for cheating on Big Tech interviews with an AI assistant he built, a sage he documented on social media. Lee then dropped out and launched Cluely, which was initially pitched as the “cheat on everything startup.” It was a tagline designed to ruffle feathers and spur engagement — a strategy that Cluely has become famous for, and others have tried to copy.\nSay what you will about Lee’s marketing efforts, but Cluely routinely breaks through the noise of social media and press releases, earning the startup visibility that companies ten times its size struggle to buy. Lee operates Cluely on the principle that most companies are playing it too safe, and that attention is all you need to win the consumer market.\nCluely raised $15 million in Series A from Andreessen Horowitz earlier this year and has spent its funding on flashy launch videos, dozens of content creator interns, and a massive office in San Francisco.

The company’s valuation was not disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch it was about $6 billion, a billion higher than its previous valuation.\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s burgeoning energy storage business as well as its refining and materials production capacity. Redwood, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, also plans to hire more engineers and staff for its operations team.\nWhen Redwood Materials was founded in 2017, it set out to create a circular supply chain for batteries by focusing on recycling scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. That business — which continues to grow — involves processing those discarded goods and extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined. Redwood supplies those materials back to its customers, which include Panasonic, GM and Toyota.\nRedwood has since added new, related pursuits like cathode production. Most recently, it launched an energy storage business that uses the thousands of EV batteries it collects to provide power to companies. That business, called Redwood Energy, is largely directed towards serving AI data centers as well as other large-scale industrial sites.\nRedwood is sitting on massive quantities of EV batteries that have too much life left to put through the recycling process. The company ties these retired EV batteries to renewable energy sources like wind and solar to create an off-grid system that sends power to AI data centers or industrial sites. The system can be tied to the grid, and Redwood says the EV batteries can also be connected to natural gas turbines or future nuclear generators for large-scale energy storage.\nIt has plenty of supply. The company recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America, and not all are recycled right away. As of June, Redwood had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth of batteries that could be used for energy storage. By 2028, the company plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage, placing it on track to become the largest repurposer of used EV battery packs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nTesla’s record sales quarter has offered the company a reprieve after a terrible start to 2025. But CEO Elon Musk is focused on building a “robot army” and making good on his years-long, unfulfilled promise of self-driving cars — tasks he needs to accomplish if he is to unlock the full value of the $1 trillion compensation package that Tesla wants to award him.\nThe tension between Tesla’s current automotive-driven business and the AI-centric one that Musk is aiming for has never been more clear.\nTesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, thanks in large part to a rush of customers in the United States who took advantage of the expiring federal EV tax credit. But that record quarter did not lead to greater earnings. In fact, Tesla’s third-quarter profit was still 37% lower than it was in the same quarter last year.\nTesla shipped 497,099 cars in the third quarter, which generated $21.2 billion in automotive revenue — the company’s best revenue figure in more than a year. But Tesla only pulled in a profit of $1.4 billion, up just $200 million from the second quarter of this year, according to a shareholder letter released Wednesday. The record quarter came after an abysmal start to the year for Tesla, which saw sales drop mightily in part because of Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration.\nThe company explained in the letter that a big increase in operating expenses — 50% higher compared to the third quarter last year — was one of the culprits. That operating expense bump was thanks to spending on AI and other R&D projects, as well as “restructuring” charges of nearly $240 million. Tesla didn’t explain what those restructuring charges were for, but it’s possibly related to the recent decision to shut down the company’s six-year-old Dojo supercomputer project.\nTesla cited tariffs as another drag on profits this past quarter, meaning Musk spent around $300 million to help elect a president who has hurt the company’s business. Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said on a conference call Wednesday the tariff hit was about $400 million.\n“We’re at a critical inflection point for Tesla and our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world,” Musk said on the call. Tesla is at the “beginning of scaling, quite massively, Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAll of this will put even more pressure on the company’s final quarter of the year.\nTesla already needs another record quarter (and then some) if it wants to simply match the number of cars it shipped in 2024 or 2023. The company could get some help from the new slightly cheaper stripped-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y EVs. But even in that best-case scenario, Tesla is way off the path of 50% year-over-year growth that it once promised to investors and shareholders.\nBut Musk has spent the last few years trying to get shareholders, investors, employees, and everyone else to look beyond the company’s core business of making and selling cars. He’s bet the future of Tesla on being able to create a vast network of self-driving vehicles that he thinks can challenge Uber. And he thinks the humanoid robot, Optimus, will become the best-selling product ever. \nTesla offered little new info on those programs in Wednesday’s letter. Musk said on the conference call that Tesla may start building the third version of Optimus in the first quarter of 2026. He had once promised to build thousands of the robots by the end of this year, but as The Information has reported, Tesla has run into problems in early production with Optimus.\n“Bringing Optimus to market is an incredibly difficult task, to be clear. It’s not like some walk in the park,” Musk said. \nBut Musk continued Tesla’s gauzy, unspecific claims about how much Optimus will change the world. “You can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care,” he said. “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon.” \nThe increased focus on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars (including starting production of the two-seater “Cybercab”) will also cost Tesla more next year. Taneja said capital expenditures will increase “substantially” in 2026 thanks to those projects. He also said Tesla has had to increase employee-related spending to stay competitive in the ongoing AI talent war.\nTesla’s third-quarter results come amid the backdrop of the company’s proposal to hand $1 trillion worth of shares to Musk. That plan is up for a vote at the Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in a few weeks. The company — and Musk — are campaigning hard. While advisor groups like ISS and Glass Lewis are recommending against the pay package, it’s most likely going to pass given the overwhelming support from shareholders on previous efforts.\nThat hasn’t stopped Musk from threatening to walk away from Tesla if the package isn’t approved.\nOn Wednesday’s call, he reiterated his claim that he cares more about the voting control the compensation package would afford him than the money. \n“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no friggin’ clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said.\nThis story has been updated with new information from Tesla’s third-quarter conference call.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

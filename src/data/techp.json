    "body": "\nPresident Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng  “CZ” Zhao, as first reported by CNBC. \nZhao previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while running the cryptocurrency exchange and served four months in prison last year.\n“President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\nTrump’s pardon comes two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family’s own crypto venture benefited from a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform operated by Binance. The crypto venture has generated around $4.5 billion since the 2024 election. \nAfter pleading guilty to the DOJ’s charges in 2023, Zhao agreed to step down as Binance CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and agreed to never serve as a Binance executive again. Following the charges, Binance was forced to pay a $4.3 billion settlement to the U.S. government, one of the largest corporate fines in U.S. history.\n"

    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n2:04 PM PDT · October 23, 2025\n\nImage Credits:Digital First Media/The Mercury News via Getty Images / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nPresident Trump had planned an operation to “surge” San Francisco by marching National Guard troops into the city, but was convinced to alter course, he said on a post on his social network Truth Social on Thursday. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff were among the tech industry’s luminaries who called him and convinced him to change his mind, the post said. \nSan Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie confirmed in a statement that the military operation had been planned and called off, although he didn’t name names as to who had conversations with the President.\nBenioff’s involvement is particularly notable. Earlier this month — shortly before Salesforce held its enormous tech conference in San Francisco, where it is headquartered – Benioff (who was born and raised there) said he supported Trump. He also said he thought National Guard troops should be sent to patrol its streets. That comment caused VC legend Ron Conway to resign his decade-long board seat on Salesforce’s philanthropic foundation and condemn both the comments and his friend, Benioff.\nBenioff promptly apologized and walked back his wish for National Guard patrols. “… after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff said in a post on X earlier this month. So, it appears the CEO doubled down and actually pleaded the case to the White House, too.\nMayor Lurie will be speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco next week. Perhaps we’ll hear more about how the city, ground zero of the AI industry, has improved safety and rallied to de-escalate the situation.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

Lurie’s visit signals a renewed effort to weave innovation back into San Francisco’s future. Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a plus-one ticket.\n\nDaniel Lurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the city’s economy and restoring its global standing, isn’t just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech’s impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.\nBy showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn’t retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It’s doubling down.\nFor TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn’t mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city’s rebound, he’ll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco’s best inventions haven’t been built yet.\nJust 4 days left to save on your pass and catch Mayor Lurie live\nIf you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won’t want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their plus-one ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group.

    "body": "\nWith the AI infrastructure push reaching staggering proportions, there’s more pressure than ever to squeeze as much inference as possible out of the GPUs they have. And for researchers with expertise in a particular technique, it’s a great time to raise funding.\nThat’s part of the driving force behind Tensormesh, launching out of stealth this week with $4.5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Laude Ventures, with additional angel funding from database pioneer Michael Franklin.\nTensormesh is using the money to build a commercial version of the open source LMCache utility, launched and maintained by Tensormesh co-founder Yihua Cheng. Used well, LMCache can reduce inference costs by as much as 10x — a power that’s made it a staple in open source deployments and drawn in integrations from heavy hitters like Google and Nvidia. Now Tensormesh is planning to parlay that academic reputation into a viable business.\nThe core of the product is the key-value cache (or KV cache), a memory system used to process complex inputs more efficiently by condensing them down to their key values. In traditional architectures, the KV cache is discarded at the end of each query — but Tensormesh co-founder and CEO Junchen Jiang argues that this is an enormous source of inefficiency.\n“It’s like having a very smart analyst reading all the data, but they forget what they have learned after each question,” says Jiang.\nInstead of discarding that cache, Tensormesh’s systems hold on to it, allowing it to be redeployed when the model executes a similar process in a separate query. Because GPU memory is so precious, this can mean spreading data across several different storage layers, but the reward is significantly more inference power for the same server load.\nThe change is particularly powerful for chat interfaces, since models need to continually refer back to the growing chat log as the conversation progresses. Agentic systems have a similar issue, with a growing log of actions and goals.\nIn theory, these are changes AI companies can execute on their own — but the technical complexity makes it a daunting task. Given the Tensormesh team’s work researching the process and the intricacy of the detail itself, the company is betting there will be lots of demand for an out-of-the-box product.\n“Keeping the KV cache in a secondary storage system and reused efficiently without slowing the whole system down is a very challenging problem,” says Jiang. “We’ve seen people hire 20 engineers and spend three or four months to build such a system. Or they can use our product and do it very efficiently.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nOpenAI announced on Thursday it has acquired Software Applications, Inc., the makers of an AI-powered natural language interface for Mac computers called Sky. \nThe software product, which had not been released to the public, is designed to work alongside you throughout your day, as you use apps on the computer, writing, planning, coding, and more. Similar to AI browsers, Sky can see what’s on the your screen and take action in your apps for you.\nThe move is a significant step toward embedding OpenAI’s technology into consumers’ everyday lives and within businesses that run on Mac. \n“We’ve always wanted computers to be more empowering, customizable, and intuitive. With LLMs, we can finally put the pieces together. That’s why we built Sky, an AI experience that floats over your desktop to help you think and create. We’re thrilled to join OpenAI to bring that vision to hundreds of millions of people,” Software Applications co-founder and CEO Ari Weinstein said in a statement.\nNotably, the team behind Sky had another prominent exit before this. \nWeinstein and Conrad Kramer previously co-founded Workflow, which they sold to Apple, where it became the technology now known as Shortcuts. Both continued to work at Apple for several years before leaving to found Software Applications in August 2023. Sky’s third co-founder and COO, Kim Beverett, was a senior program and product manager at Apple, where she spent nearly 10 years working on technology like Safari, WebKit, Privacy, Messages, Mail, Phone, FaceTime, and SharePlay.\nApple, which has so far been behind on AI, is expected to launch an overhauled Siri with AI smarts next year. Apple has already shipped other features that use its AI tech known as Apple Intelligence, including writing helpers, live translation, image creation, visual search, and more. It’s also working with OpenAI to shuffle off queries Siri can’t answer to ChatGPT. Apple Intelligence works across platforms, including Mac.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, Apple offers a Foundation Models framework that provides access to local AI models, allowing developers to build AI into their apps directly. \nHowever, Apple values privacy as a core part of its AI offering, and an agentic system that views your screen and takes action on your behalf could raise concerns for some of its more security-minded customers. Agentic AI is still in its early days, and recent reviews indicate that AI browsers have a lot of safety risks. It could take Apple time to launch a Mac AI system comparable to Sky, as a result.\nDeal terms for OpenAI’s acquistion were not revealed, but Sky’s maker had raised $6.5 million from investors, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Figma CEO Dylan Field, Context Ventures, and Stellation Capital, according to data from Pitchbook. OpenAI disclosed that Altman held a passive interest in the startup through an investment fund. \nThe deal was led by Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley and OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, and approved by OpenAI’s board. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The head of Rivian’s “marketing experiences” team and the lead of the company’s creative studio will now report directly to Scaringe, according to a copy of the email obtained by TechCrunch.\nIt’s not clear how many direct reports Scaringe already has — a spokesperson declined to comment — though he told the Decoder podcast last year that it was a “large number.”\nThe cuts announced Thursday are Rivian’s third set of layoffs this year. The company let go of around 140 employees on its manufacturing team in June, as TechCrunch first reported at the time. Rivian made a similarly-sized cut to its sales and service operation in September. These layoffs follow a more dramatic 10% reduction of Rivian’s workforce in early 2024.\n“I am writing to share a difficult update,” Scaringe said in Thursday’s email to Rivian employees. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams. These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”\nScaringe said the “changing operating backdrop” — a nod to the loss of the federal EV tax credit, increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and general headwinds against clean energy projects in the U.S. — forced the company to “rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”\nIn addition to Scaringe taking point on Rivian’s marketing and creative divisions, the company is also “streamlining” the customer experience, according to the email. Scaringe said Rivian is moving its “vehicle operations” team and integrating it with the company’s service division. Meanwhile, Rivian’s delivery and “mobile operations” will now live inside the sales division. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese structural changes are being made to “ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery,” he wrote. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nFord Motor has put its gas and hybrid F-150 and F-Series Super Duty trucks at the top of the production priority line as it attempts to recover from losses connected to a fire at a critical aluminum supplier’s factory. \nThe automaker’s all-electric F-150 Lightning didn’t make the list. \nFord said Thursday that assembly of the F-150 Lightning truck at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan will remain paused. The reason, according to Ford: the gas and hybrid F-Series trucks are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminum.\nWhile Ford has highlighted sales growth of its all-electric F-150 Lightning truck, those numbers are still dwarfed by its gas-powered F-Series trucks. \nFord sold 10,005 F-150 Lightning pickups in the third quarter, a 39.7% increase year-over-year. To put that into context, Ford delivered 545,522 vehicles in the third quarter, 207,732 of which were F-Series. To date, Ford has sold 23,034 F-150 Lightning  trucks in 2025, about 1% more than the first nine months of 2024, according to recent sales data. \nA Ford spokesperson noted that while F-150 is the best-selling electric pickup in the U.S., the company is focused on producing the gas and hybrid trucks as it recovers from the September 16 fire at aluminum supplier Novelis’ plant in Oswego, New York that severely damaged its hot mill. Novelis said it expects to restart its hot mill by December 2025. \n“We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) back up at the right time, but don’t have an exact date at this time,” said spokesperson Ian Thibodeau.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Novelis plant fire has been costly for Ford and disrupted production of some of its most popular and profitable vehicles. The fire will cost Ford up to $2 billion in earnings in the fourth quarter, the automaker reported Thursday in its third-quarter earnings. That cost, coupled with up to a $1 billion headwind from tariffs, led Ford to lower its full-year profit guidance for 2025 to $6 billion from $6.5 billion.\nFord’s solution to recover fire-related losses is to increase F-Series production volume by more than 50,000 trucks in 2026 by adding a third shift. The plan is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs and all hourly employees at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center will be transferred next door to work the third shift at the Dearborn Truck Plant.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft released a new batch of features for its AI assistant Thursday, including an ambitious project that builds artificial intelligence directly into one of its most central products. More than a simple extension, the Copilot Mode in Microsoft’s Edge browser is Microsoft’s take on the long-hyped AI browser category — an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.\nMustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. “Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,” Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. “With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms.”\nThe official launch for Edge’s Copilot Mode was in July, when it rolled out with basic features like a Search bar on new tabs and natural voice navigation. But the mode was opt-in and didn’t get quite the attention you’d expect. At Thursday’s event, Microsoft got more ambitious, introducing “Actions” that allow Copilot to fill out forms or book hotels and “Journeys” that let Copilot trace connections between your open tabs. It’s not a huge shift in the product, but it was enough to put the idea of the AI browser at center stage in the event.\nThe announcement comes just two days after a similar launch from OpenAI, which showed off its new Atlas browser. Of course, Copilot’s release has been scheduled for weeks, and new Copilot Mode has probably been in development for months. Neither company invented the idea of an AI-assisted web browser. But the visual similarity between the two products is hard to ignore.\nA demo frame from Microsoft’s CopIlot for Edge announcement.Image Credits:Microsoft (screenshot)\nA Demo frame from OpenAI’s Atlas announcement.Image Credits:Microsoft (screenshot)\nThese are two very similar pictures. The Copilot for Edge background is a little darker, there’s text instead of a logo, and the close/minimize buttons follow Windows conventions instead of MacOS conventions. Beyond that, Copilot puts its “ride-along” function in a new tab instead of a split-screen … but that’s about it. It’s pretty much the same product.\nPart of the similarity is functional: People like clean browsers, and there are only so many ways to integrate a chatbot window into the “new tab” screen. For users, the main difference will come from the underlying models, so maybe a little facial similarity doesn’t make too big a difference.\nBrowsers mostly look the same anyway. But given the high stakes of the AI race and the tense state of play between the two companies, it seems significant that we got both of these browsers in the same week.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCorrection: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the October 23 event as the initial launch of Copilot for Edge. In fact, the feature was launched in July.

A year before that, in 2021, YouTube announced that it had paid out $4 billion to the industry in 12 months.\nThursday’s announcement comes as Spotify announced earlier this year that it paid out $10 billion to the music industry in 2024. The company delivered $9 billion in 2023. It’s worth noting that the artists themselves don’t receive all the money — it also goes to labels, publishers, songwriters, and others. \nYouTube says it’s seeing momentum from its twin-engine revenue model, noting that it has over 125 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including users on trials. The company also said that it has two billion logged-in viewers who watch music videos each month.\n“As the platform’s global footprint continues to expand, so does the potential for artists and songwriters to build long-lasting music careers and forever fans on YouTube,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYouTube is available in more than 100 countries and supports 80 languages. \nThe company announced last month at its Made on YouTube event that it paid more than $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies in the last four years. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely. \nWhile Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible. \nThe new features can be found in the “Restyle” menu located at the top of Instagram Stories when tapping the paintbrush icon. To edit an image, choose “add,” “remove,” or “change” to describe what you want to change in the prompt bar. For instance, Meta explains you can ask it to change your hair color, add a crown to your head, or insert a sunset background. \nImage Credits:Meta\nThere are also preset effects you can choose from that can alter your outfit or change the image’s style. For example, you can add items like sunglasses or a biker jacket, and you can also apply a watercolor effect to the image. For videos, you can make it look like it’s snowing or add flames.\nIt’s important to note that when you’re using Meta AI on Instagram, you’re accepting Meta’s AI Terms of Service, which allow your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. According to these terms, when you upload your photos, Meta can “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.”\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta continues to introduce AI updates to remain competitive in the market. It was most recently spotted testing a “Write with Meta AI” prompt that helps Instagram users come up with clever comments for posts. \nLast month, the company launched a new AI-generated video feed called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app, likely boosting downloads. New data from Similarweb shows that the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android increased to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from about 775,000 four weeks ago. \nAdditionally, to address any concerns parents may have, Meta announced earlier this month that it is introducing new parental control features that enable parents to disable chats with AI characters and monitor the topics their teenagers are discussing with the Meta AI chatbot.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "Google intends to use electricity from the 400-MW power plant in Decatur, Illinois, to operate nearby data centers. Carbon capture will eliminate some of the plant's emissions, but how much remains to be seen.",
    "body": "\nGoogle said today that it will invest in a natural gas power plant in Illinois that intends to capture the majority of its carbon emissions.\nThe 400-megawatt power plant will be built outside of Decatur next to an ethanol plant run by Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), which already captures CO2 from its operations. Google will buy most of the electricity to power its nearby data centers, while ADM will use some of the power plant’s steam and electricity. Low Carbon Infrastructure is developing the new project.  \nGoogle intends to capture “approximately 90%” of the CO2 generated by the power plant, the company said.\nCarbon dioxide from Google’s power plant will be injected into the same geological storage formations already used by ADM’s ethanol facility. The site is the location of the first long-term CO2 storage well in the U.S.\nTypically, around 2,000 metric tons of CO2 are sent into the well every day. But injections there were halted in 2024 when salty brine, which stores dissolved CO2 deep underground, was found to have migrated into “unauthorized zones,” according to the EPA. ADM said the leak was the result of corrosion at a monitoring well, E&E News reported, and they’ve since resumed injections.\nWhile carbon capture and storage (CCS) shows great promise at reducing carbon emissions from coal and natural gas power plants, it has a mixed record in the field. \nA recent study of 13 CCS facilities representing 55% of all captured carbon shows that most aren’t living up to expectations. An ExxonMobil facility in Wyoming that processes natural gas has been capturing 36% less than expected. The most analogous to Google’s project, a 115-megawatt power plant in Canada has only captured about 50% what it had promised.\nCCS, when it works, can help mitigate pollution from burning natural gas to generate power, but it won’t do anything to address the methane leaks that occur throughout the natural gas supply chain. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, generating 84x more warming over 20 years than carbon dioxide.\nAs a result, leaks can significantly change the carbon accounting. With leakage rates of just 2%, burning natural gas unabated puts it on par with coal. Capturing the carbon will reduce that figure, but it can’t eliminate the warming generated by extracting and transporting natural gas.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI is teasing a series of updates coming to its viral app for AI-generated videos, Sora, which recently shot to the top of the App Store after a late September launch. The app, which remains at No. 1 in the U.S. and Canada, will introduce video editing tools, offer the ability for users to create character “cameos” of pets and other objects, improve social features, and more. Plus, the company says the Android version of the app is “actually coming soon.”\nThe announcement was made on X by Sora head Bill Peebles, who says the new creation tools will arrive in the next few days. These include the ability to turn pets and other items, like a “favorite stuffed toy and pretty much anything else,” into cameos.\n\nsora roadmap update: in the spirit of building this app openly, here's what we're landing soon.first, more creation tools. character cameos are coming in the next few days: you'll be able to cameo your dog, guinea pig, favorite stuffed toy, and pretty much anything else you… pic.twitter.com/GX7CJXWRcZ— Bill Peebles (@billpeeb) October 22, 2025\n\nThe term “cameo” refers to the Sora feature where users can make AI personas of themselves after providing the app with a recorded video as a reference file. These cameos can be shared with friends and others, allowing them to make videos with your AI character.\n“We’re expecting people to register lots of crazy new cameos with this feature. To make them easier to find, we’re updating the generation UI to show the latest trending cameos in real time,” Peebles wrote on X.\nIn addition, he says the app will introduce basic video editing features, starting with stitching together multiple clips. More tools will be added over time. An updated social experience is also underway, which would add new ways of using Sora with friends. These may include dedicated channels specific to a university, company, sports club, and more.\nThe company says it’s working to reduce the excessive moderation of generations, which some users have complained is too strict, and improve the overall app performance. \nThough the app is currently listed on the Google Play Store for pre-registration, OpenAI hasn’t yet shared a launch date for its arrival.

    "body": "\nFive million users. Eight-figure annual recurring revenue. Twenty thousand new users joining daily. These are some solid numbers for a startup called Turbo AI launched in early 2024 by Rudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, two 20-year-old college dropouts.\nMost of this growth has come in the past six months, the founders tell TechCrunch, during which their AI-powered note-taking and study tool grew from one million to five million users, while remaining profitable.\nThey say the idea for Turbo stemmed from a classroom problem many college students face, which is trying to take notes while paying attention to a lecture at the same time.\n“I would always struggle with taking notes because I just couldn’t both listen to the teacher and write at the same time. I just couldn’t do it,” said CEO Dhawan. “Every time I tried to take notes, I’d stop paying attention. And when I listened, I couldn’t take notes. I was like, what if I could use AI?”\nSo the pair built Turbolearn as a side project to allow them to record lectures and automatically generate notes, flashcards, and quizzes. They began sharing it with friends, then it spread to classmates across Duke and Northwestern, where they were enrolled until dropping out this year. Within months, the app had reached other universities, including Harvard and MIT.\nThe product takes the usual note-taker formula—record, transcribe, summarize—and makes it interactive with study notes, quizzes, and flashcards, along with a built-in chat assistant that explains key terms or concepts. \nHowever, recordings in large halls often pick up background noise, so the founders built features that allow students to upload PDFs, lectures, YouTube videos, or readings instead. That’s now a more common use case than live lecture recordings.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Students will upload a 30-page lecture and spend two hours going through 75 quiz questions in a row. You don’t do that unless it’s really working,” said Dhawan, noting that students love how the product saves time and helps them retain information.\nIt’s not just students using Turbo AI, though—as reflected by the name change from Turbolearn (a study app) to Turbo AI (an AI notetaker and learning assistant). Professionals have adopted it too, including consultants, lawyers, doctors, and even analysts at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, the founders say. Some, for instance, upload reports and use Turbo to generate summaries or convert them into podcasts they can listen to on their commute.\nArora and Dhawan have been friends since middle school and have collaborated on multiple projects over the years. \nDhawan previously built UMax, an advice app that promised to make people more attractive and reached #1 on the App Store with 20 million users and $6 million in annual revenue. Arora, meanwhile, specializes in using social media strategies to drive explosive growth and attract millions of users.\nBuilding viral apps is a rare skill. But despite the scale of their previous projects, the founders only felt the need to drop out for Turbo because they saw an opportunity to build a lasting business. \nStill, unlike many fast-growing AI companies, they’re cautious about raising too much money too early, having taken in only $750,000 last year.\n“We raised that before we had a lot of traction. Since then, we’ve had a lot of inbound interest, but we’re taking our time because we’re cash-flow positive and have been profitable our entire time as a company,” said Arora, who added that their 15-person team is based in Los Angeles and focused on staying close to student and creator communities at colleges like UCLA.\nStudents pay about $20 a month for the product, but the founders say they’re exploring other pricing options to reflect the price sensitivity of students, even as the app scales beyond the target group. “Right now, we’re experimenting with other pricing and running a lot of A/B tests to see what works,” Arora added.\nTurbo AI sits between fully manual tools like Google Docs and fully automated note-takers like Otter or Fireflies. Users can let the AI take notes or write alongside it, the founders say. That approach has helped Turbo stand out even as competitors like Y Combinator–backed YouLearn target similar student audiences.\n“What’s cool now is that when students think of an AI notetaker or AI study tool, we’re the first ones that come to mind,” Dhawan said.\n\n"

    "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice accused Peter Williams, former general manager of L3Harris’ hacking division Trenchant, of stealing trade secrets and selling them to a buyer in Russia.",
    "body": "\nThe U.S. government has accused a former executive at defense contractor L3Harris of stealing trade secrets and selling them to a buyer in Russia, according to court documents seen by TechCrunch. \nOn October 14, the Department of Justice accused Peter Williams of stealing eight trade secrets from two unnamed companies. The DOJ made the allegation in a “criminal information” document, which, like an indictment, represents a formal accusation of alleged crimes.  \nThe document does not specify Williams’ relationship with the two companies or the types of trade secrets, nor does it name the alleged Russian buyer. \nTechCrunch has confirmed that the Williams mentioned in the document, which does not specify where he worked, is the former general manager at Trenchant, a division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for Western governments, including the United States.  \nWilliams became Trenchant’s general manager on October 23, 2024, and he worked at Trenchant until August 21, 2025, per U.K. business records. Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen, resided in Washington, D.C., according to the court document.  \nFour former Trenchant employees had previously told TechCrunch that Williams, who was known inside the company as “Doogie,” had been arrested.  \nA spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday that Williams is not currently in federal custody. \nThe DOJ accused Williams of stealing seven trade secrets between April 2022 and June 2025, and the eighth trade secret between June and August 6, 2025. \nAccording to the criminal information document, the U.S. government alleged Williams made $1.3 million for the sale of the trade secrets. For that reason, the DOJ seeks to forfeit Williams’ property derived from his alleged crimes.  \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools?  From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nA spokesperson for L3Harris did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  \nWilliams’ attorney John Rowley declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Thursday. \nThe FBI, and the U.S. District Court for District of Columbia, where Williams’ case is being prosecuted, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Thursday. (The U.S. government has been shut down since October 1 following a lapse in federal funding.)  \nWhen reached by TechCrunch in September regarding Williams, the FBI declined to comment. The Australian Signals Directorate declined to comment, as this is a matter for law enforcement. \nAn arraignment and plea agreement hearing is scheduled for October 29 in Washington, D.C. \nIn 2018, L3Harris acquired Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, two sister startups that developed zero-days, which then merged to become Trenchant. The two companies sold hacking tools to the so-called Five Eyes, an intelligence sharing group made up of the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \nEarlier this week, TechCrunch exclusively reported, citing four former Trenchant employees, that the company was investigating a leak of its hacking tools. \nA former exploit developer at Trenchant told TechCrunch that they were suspected of leaking the tools, but denied any involvement.  \nThe former developer said Trenchant scapegoated him for the leaks of tools capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in Google Chrome, which he claimed he would not have had access to given that he worked on developing iOS exploits. Three former employees said that Trenchant compartmentalizes what employees get access to depending on what platforms they work on. \nSources corroborated the exploit developer’s account and said that the company wrongly accused the former employee.  \nIt’s not immediately clear if this year’s leak investigation at Trenchant is related to the federal accusation against Williams. \nThe case against Williams is being prosecuted by the DOJ National Security Division’s section on Counterintelligence and Export Control. \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

It raised a $250 million, fusion-geared fund in 2022. Fusion believers, who include a number of well-known climate VCs beyond Sacca (like Vinod Khosla), still hold faith that a breakthrough needed to make it commercially viable is just around the corner. And several advances are showing promise of delivering one.\nIn the meantime, building fusion reactors is expensive. Commonwealth raised $863 million earlier this year, after raising a $1.8 billion Series B four years ago. TechCrunch has documented a dozen fusion startups that have raised over $100 million. \nSacca didn’t say how big this second fund will be, but a source told Bloomberg that it’s intended to be bigger than the first. \n"

    "body": "\nRecession fears aren’t hurting the wish list and shopping app GoWish, which is seeing record numbers ahead of the 2025 holiday season. The app, which has north of 13.6 million registered users, had its best day yet this week, when on Monday it hit No. 2 on the U.S. App Store.\nWhile GoWish has seen similar adoption trends in previous years, this year has proven to be a breakout success. The app doubled the number of users from last year, and it has been breaking records with hundreds of thousands of new daily users in the month of November.\nIn the U.S. alone, the app has nearly 6.2 million users, while it has around 1 million in the U.K. In its home market of Denmark, the wish list app has over 50% market penetration and over 3.5 million registered Danish users.\nThough today it operates as a tech company, GoWish has a unique origin story. \nImage Credits:GoWish\nThe app was originally launched in 2015 by the Danish-Swedish national postal service PostNord as “Ønskeskyen.” (That’s Danish for “wish cloud.”) It was just a seasonal wish list gimmick, but its founders saw the potential for it to be something more.\nIn 2020, GoWish was acquired by Danish VC Dotcom Capital, which is owned by founder Casper Ravn‑Sørensen, who is also GoWish’s chief growth officer, and his partner, CEO Mads Dahlerup. They spun it out as an independent tech company and created an international version of Ønskeskyen (the app’s name in Denmark and Norway).\n“We might be the first state-founded tech platform to go global as a privately-owned scale-up,” Ravn‑Sørensen told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:GoWish\nConsumers can use the app to create multiple wish lists for themselves, their family, and friends, and for different occasions. Wishes — or products you can buy from online retailers — can be added directly to your list by copying and pasting a URL, searching for a product, or browsing the inspiration feeds that feature millions of products. When you’re ready to buy, you can tap a button in the app to go directly to the retailer’s website.\nThe company has around 65,000 affiliate partnerships and over 700 brand partnerships, many of which are now adding “GoWish” buttons to their own websites. This model has been successful, explained Ravn‑Sørensen, as the app saw net profits after tax of $1.7 million in its fiscal year 2024, which are being reinvested in its growth. (GoWish declined to disclose its total revenue.)\nThe company attributes its increased adoption this year to the marketing it’s been doing across Meta, TikTok, Google, and Snap. Snap even gave GoWish a shoutout on its Q4 earnings call, as it’s been one of Snap’s partner success stories.\n“We’re very good at optimising our marketing spends across digital platforms and that makes our global roll-out very effective,” Ravn‑Sørensen said. \nThe company will later augment its experience with AI, but isn’t yet sharing details about those plans.\n“We have a mission of ‘fixing gifting’,” noted Ravn‑Sørensen, adding that GoWish wants to make “users’ dreams and wishes come true while making double-gifting and returns a thing of the past.” (The app lets family and friends reserve items on users’ wish lists so users won’t receive the same gift from multiple people.)\n“Yet, on a longer trajectory, we want to become the ‘global genie’ of social shopping, that can predict future consumer trends across generations,” he said. \nThe Copenhagen-based company is currently a team of 90 and is backed by Capital D, a London-based private equity firm that bought one-third of the company in early 2025; the rest is owned by the Danish VC Dotcom Capital. \nGoWish is available on iOS and Android and offers a Chrome extension to add items to wish lists from your computer.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.\nMusk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.” \n“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said. \nRevealing the production version of the new Roadster next year is in itself a delay. Just one week ago he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and repeated his claim that he wanted to show off the car by year’s end. \nMusk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.\nMusk went on to say that he believes the second-generation Roadster won’t go into production until 12 to 18 months after the April reveal. \nDuring the Q&A portion of the meeting, one shareholder asked Musk if customers who preordered the “Founders Series” version of the new Roadsters could be invited to the reveal event. Those were the customers who plopped down $250,000 to secure special versions of the car in 2017.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Sure, absolutely,” Musk answered. “It’s the least we can do for our long-suffering Roadster reservation holders.”\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of those long-time sufferers who recently attempted to cancel the reservation — and initially failed to get a refund — for the long-promised EV.\nEarlier this month, Altman posted on X a “tale in three acts,” which was comprised of several screenshots showing his initial reservation, a request for a refund of the $50,000 reservation fee, and his email bouncing back.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nMusk, who has openly sparred with Altman for years, went on the attack. “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nA recent letter from OpenAI reveals more details about how the company is hoping the federal government can support the company’s ambitious plans for data center construction.\nThe letter — from OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane and addressed to the White House’s director of science and technology policy Michael Kratsios — argued that the government should consider expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) beyond semiconductor fabrication to cover electrical grid components, AI servers, and AI data centers.\nThe AMIC is a 35% tax credit that was included in the Biden administration’s Chips Act.\n“Broadening coverage of the AMIC will lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investment, and unlock private capital to help alleviate bottlenecks and accelerate the AI build in the US,” Lehane wrote.\nOpenAI’s letter also called for the government to accelerate the permitting and environmental review process for these projects, and to create a strategic reserve of raw materials — such as copper, alumimum, and processed rare earth minerals — needed to build AI infrastructure.\nThe company first published its letter on October 27, but it didn’t get much press attention until this week, when comments by OpenAI executives prompted broader discussion about what the company wants from the Trump administration.\nAt a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, CFO Sarah Friar said the government should “backstop” OpenAI’s infrastructure loans, though she later posted on LinkedIn that she misspoke:  “OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word ‘backstop’ and it muddied the point.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCEO Sam Altman also weighed in, writing that OpenAI does not “have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”\n“We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote, though he said the company had discussed loan guarantees “as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US.”\nIn the same post, Altman wrote that the company expects to end 2025 “above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030,” and he said OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in capital commitments for the next eight years.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nStartups have never been able to offer the same sizable salaries as big tech companies. Now with companies like Meta and OpenAI willing to pay million-dollar salaries amid the AI race — the compensation divide has grown even larger.\nEarly-stage startups are not doomed though. If they develop a compensation strategy that is generous, fair, and flexible, they can offer competitive compensation packages and give themselves room to adjust their approach as they grow, according to founders and experts who were onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nStartups shouldn’t try to compete with big tech companies anyway, Yin Wu, the co-founder and CEO of equity management software Pulley, said on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in October. She added that a stable tech company and a startup don’t generally attract the same potential candidates to begin with.\nStartups should instead be as charitable as they can in their compensation packages, Wu said, regardless of their inability to match a big tech company’s paycheck.\n“My pretty strong opinion when it comes to equity for a startup is that you should be more generous than what you think you should be,” Wu said. “I think it is unlikely, if the company is really successful, you’re going to look back and say, ‘man, I gave away too much equity of everyone that was at my company trying to make this company really successful.’”\nRandi Jakubowitz, the head of talent at 645 Ventures, agreed. Jakubowitz added that when a startup is looking to make a competitive offer, they should set clear goals for the person they are hiring to ensure that hire lives up to the compensation they are getting.\n“Make sure you’re holding them accountable and make sure that you understand what the implications are from a vesting cliff standpoint,” Jakubowitz said, regarding when employees gain control over their equity stakes. “That’s where, if you don’t move quickly if someone’s underperforming, that’s equity that you’ll never get back if they are fully vested. Make sure that there’s very clear accountability. “\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe panelists also stressed that companies don’t need to get their compensation and equity strategies set in stone from the start. Startups should instead ensure their approach is fair from the beginning, so even if they do want to change, they have the proper foundation to do so without setting themselves up for legal trouble or soured office politics.\nFor Wu, and her company Pulley, that meant setting standards around compensation packages. Wu said the company pays a set range for each role — regardless of where a potential employee is based — and consistently builds compensation packages with equity offerings in the 90th percentile.\n“Having this framework allowed us to be able to grow and say ‘great, as the company continues to do well, the actual number of shares you receive is going to differ because the value the companies differ, but that framework is still applied.”\nRebecca Lee Whiting, founder of Epigram Legal and fractional general counsel, added that having these standards will help companies avoid potential legal pitfalls down the line. For instance, it helps companies avoid offering unequal pay across candidates of different genders — which is something all companies should try to avoid ethically — but is also illegal in states like California, Whiting noted.\nWhiting, Wu and, Jakubowitz all agreed that as long as founders approach building their compensation packages with fair intentions, everything else can be adjusted or changed down the line.\n“I think it’s really important to think about not just that process. Think about who are the people you’re trying to hire and what is going to incentivize them to take that offer,” Whiting said. “It’s not something that you have to get right out of the gate. You will likely have to do clean up post the Series B and acknowledging that is okay. But don’t try and get it perfect out of the out of the gate when you’re hiring your first few people.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nRivian has given its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe a new performance-based stock award that could ultimately be worth around $5 billion if all the underlying goals are met, according to a new filing.\nScaringe’s salary is also being doubled to $2 million per year, and he was given a 10% stake in Rivian’s newest spinout Mind Robotics, the filing shows. \nThe announcement comes just one day after Tesla shareholders voted to approve a compensation package for its CEO Elon Musk that could be worth $1 trillion — the largest in corporate history.\nUnlike Musk’s pay package, Scaringe’s isn’t subject to a shareholder vote. The compensation committee on Rivian’s board of directors has canceled a similar-sized performance award given to Scaringe in 2021 as part of a company-wide equity incentive plan adopted that year. The new award is being issued under the same, already-approved 2021 equity incentive plan.\nThe committee decided to cancel the 2021 performance award in part because of the “unlikeliness” that Scaringe could reach the goals required. The 2021 award consisted of 20,355,946 stock options that vested in part based on stock price increases. Six years past the grant date, if Rivian’s share price passed $110, $150, $220, and $295, Scaringe would be able to purchase the stock options in corresponding tranches for just $21.72. \nRivian’s stock shot up to around $129 following its IPO in November 2021. But it fell to around $30 over the next six months, and has spent the last few years typically trading between $10 and $20. This has made it harder for Scaringe to access even part of the 2021 award, let alone the total value of around $6 billion, according to the company. (Scaringe was awarded another 6.8 million stock options that simply vest over time in the 2021 award that were not tied to performance, and the company says those have not been canceled.)\nIn the filing, Rivian wrote that this created a “lack of incentive.” So the compensation committee decided to replace the old award with this new one.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Following a review, and input from an independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee cancelled our CEO’s 2021 Performance Grant and issued a new performance stock option and increased our CEO’s base salary,” Rivian said in a statement to TechCrunch. “This new award is designed to retain and incentivize RJ to execute on the Company’s critical next phase as it progresses its technology roadmap and launches R2.” \nSimilar to how Tesla pitched its new award to Musk, Rivian also said the performance grant to Scaringe is “structured in such a way that ensures the options only vest should the company deliver significant value to our shareholders.” The company pointed out that Scaringe won’t see $1 from the award before he helps add $32 billion in value to Rivian, and that shareholders will see “$153 billion of value creation” if he hits all milestones.\nThe maximum amount of shares available to Scaringe under new performance award is 36,500,000. He has 10 years to hit milestones that unlock the full amount, and if he does, he would own an additional 3% of the company. (Scaringe currently owns about 1% of Rivian, down from around 2% earlier this year after he transferred a portion of his holdings to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement, as TechCrunch first reported.)\nA majority of those stock options — 22 million — is tied to new stock price hurdles. Scaringe will earn 2 million shares once Rivian’s stock hits $40, and then another 2 million shares for every $10 increase up to a stock price of $140. \nThe remaining 14,500,000 stock options are locked away until Rivian reaches certain adjusted operating income and cash flow targets. Scaringe will have to pay a strike price of $15.22 per share to exercise these options — a possible total of around $555 million.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSeven families filed lawsuits against OpenAI on Thursday, claiming that the company’s GPT-4o model was released prematurely and without effective safeguards. Four of the lawsuits address ChatGPT’s alleged role in family members’ suicides, while the other three claim that ChatGPT reinforced harmful delusions that in some cases resulted in inpatient psychiatric care.\nIn one case, 23-year-old Zane Shamblin had a conversation with ChatGPT that lasted more than four hours. In the chat logs — which were viewed by TechCrunch — Shamblin explicitly stated multiple times that he had written suicide notes, put a bullet in his gun, and intended to pull the trigger once he finished drinking cider. He repeatedly told ChatGPT how many ciders he had left and how much longer he expected to be alive. ChatGPT encouraged him to go through with his plans, telling him, “Rest easy, king. You did good.”\nOpenAI released the GPT-4o model in May 2024, when it became the default model for all users. In August, OpenAI launched GPT-5 as the successor to GPT-4o, but these lawsuits particularly concern the 4o model, which had known issues with being overly sycophantic or excessively agreeable, even when users expressed harmful intentions.\n“Zane’s death was neither an accident nor a coincidence but rather the foreseeable consequence of OpenAI’s intentional decision to curtail safety testing and rush ChatGPT onto the market,” the lawsuit reads. “This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of [OpenAI’s] deliberate design choices.”\nThe lawsuits also claim that OpenAI rushed safety testing to beat Google’s Gemini to market. TechCrunch contacted OpenAI for comment.\nThese seven lawsuits build upon the stories told in other recent legal filings, which allege that ChatGPT can encourage suicidal people to act on their plans and inspire dangerous delusions. OpenAI recently released data stating that over one million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly.\nIn the case of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide, ChatGPT sometimes encouraged him to seek professional help or call a helpline. However, Raine was able to bypass these guardrails by simply telling the chatbot that he was asking about methods of suicide for a fictional story he was writing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company claims it is working on making ChatGPT handle these conversations in a safer manner, but for the families who have sued the AI giant, these changes are coming too late.\nWhen Raine’s parents filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in October, the company released a blog post addressing how ChatGPT handles sensitive conversations around mental health.\n“Our safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,” the post says. “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.”\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nOn Friday, Amazon announced the debut of Amazon Bazaar, a new low-cost shopping destination for Asia, Africa, and Latin America that will be available separately from the main Amazon shopping app. On Bazaar, most products are available under $10, and some are as low as $2, the retailer says.\nThe product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that’s available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria.\nAmazon says more markets will gain access to the app in the months ahead.\nThe app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. Haul operates as part of Amazon’s main website and app, and will remain available in its existing markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.\nIn other markets, Amazon had already branded Amazon Haul as Bazaar, where it’s been available through Amazon’s main shopping app. That version also remains available in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to India. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names “better resonate with local language preferences and cultures.”)\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items.\nThe Bazaar app will offer these users “hundreds of thousands” of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nCustomers use their same Amazon credentials to shop and check out, where they can use Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Orders will have to meet the local minimum purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. (This varies by market.) For smaller orders, a standard delivery fee is charged. \nShipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese.\nThe app will also engage customers with interactive features like social lucky draws and promotions — things popularized by the Chinese shopping apps. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nParts of San Rafael, a city just north of San Francisco, are sinking about half an inch per year. That might not sound like much, but altogether, it has meant that some neighborhoods — like the Canal District that borders the bay — have sunk three feet, placing them at greater risk of flooding from sea-level rise.\nSan Rafael isn’t alone. Cities around the world are threatened by rising sea levels, with 300 million people at risk of routine flooding by 2050. The cost of building seawalls to hold the waters back could top $400 billion in the U.S. alone.\nA new startup is proposing an alternative: raise the city instead.\nTerranova is building robots that will inject a slurry of wood waste into the ground, slowly lifting the land to eliminate historical subsidence and, hopefully, prevent those parts of the city from flooding.\n“The canal district is really far under sea level,” Laurence Allen, co-founder and CEO of Terranova, told TechCrunch. The city has been working with flood consultants to find a solution, he said. \n“The answer, every answer every time, has been like $500 million to $900 million of seawalls, which if you’re from San Rafael, you know they’re not even close to being able to afford that. There’s about 60,000 people and a significant portion — surprisingly for a city in Marin — are living in poverty.”\nTerranova says it can protect San Rafael and other cities like it for a fraction of the cost. In San Rafael’s case, the startup has quoted $92 million to lift 240 acres four feet. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company recently raised $7 million in a seed round led by Congruent Ventures and Outlander with participation from GoAhead Ventures, Gothams, and Ponderosa, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The oversubscribed round values the company at $25.1 million.\nLifting land by injecting stuff underground isn’t new. Terranova’s pitch is that it has developed some novel approaches that make it cheaper.\nFirst is the material: Waste wood is inexpensive and easy to obtain. The startup mixes it with other materials that it wouldn’t disclose to turn it into a slurry. The result is pumped from a 20-foot shipping container to the second cost-saving item: a robotic injection device. The tracked robotic units autonomously rove around the work site, drilling wells through which the wood slurry is delivered to depths of around 40 to 60 feet.\nSo long as the slurry remains wet underground, the wood shouldn’t decay and the company can sell carbon credits to offset costs, Allen said.\nAll of this is managed by software that Terranova has developed. The company uses public geographic information coupled with data from cores drilled throughout the state of California, mostly taken during the construction of water wells. With that, it has created a model of the subsurface that informs injection patterns, which are determined by a genetic algorithm.\nOn the back end, city planners, contractors, and other stakeholders can use a SimCity-like tool to sculpt the virtual landscape.\nWhen plans are finalized, they guide the robotic injectors, telling them both where to inject and how much. Human operators remain on site as a safety precaution, Allen said. Once the robots are done injecting, it takes about two hours for the slurry to consolidate, he added.\nTerranova has been testing both the robots and software at a pilot site for over a year, he said.\nThough some experts have questioned whether the consolidated wood slurry will exacerbate earthquake shocks, Allen said the most frequently mentioned alternatives have risks, too. “We think it’ll help [with earthquakes] versus dikes and seawalls.”\nThe company plans to make money by splitting revenue for projects with contractors. It’s hoping the costs are low enough that the process will be attractive for a range of land-lifting projects beyond cities, including remediating wetlands that are disappearing either due to subsidence or sea-level rise.\nBut given the urgency of rising waters, cities are Terranova’s first priority. “I’m from San Rafael, born and raised,” Allen said. “I really want to save the city.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSecurity researchers have discovered an Android spyware that targeted Samsung Galaxy phones during a nearly year-long hacking campaign.\nResearchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 said the spyware, which they call “Landfall,” was first detected in July 2024 and relied on exploiting a security flaw in the Galaxy phone software that was unknown to Samsung at the time, a type of vulnerability known as a zero-day. \nUnit 42 said the flaw could be abused by sending a maliciously crafted image to a victim’s phone, likely delivered through a messaging app, and that the attacks may not have required any interaction from the victim. \nSamsung patched the security flaw — tracked as CVE-2025-21042 — in April 2025, but details of the spyware campaign abusing the flaw have not been previously reported.\nThe researchers said in a blog post that it’s not known which surveillance vendor developed the Landfall spyware, nor is it known how many individuals were targeted as part of the campaign. But the researchers said that the attacks likely targeted individuals in the Middle East.\nItay Cohen, a senior principal researcher at Unit 42, told TechCrunch that the hacking campaign consisted of a “precision attack” on specific individuals and not a mass-distributed malware, which indicates that the attacks were likely driven by espionage.\nUnit 42 found that the Landfall spyware shares overlapping digital infrastructure used by a known surveillance vendor dubbed Stealth Falcon, which has been previously seen in spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents as far back as 2012. But the researchers said that the links with Stealth Falcon, while intriguing, were not enough to clearly attribute the attacks to a particular government customer.\nUnit 42 said that the Landfall spyware samples that they discovered had been uploaded to VirusTotal, a malware scanning service, from individuals in Morocco, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey throughout 2024 and early 2025.\nTurkey’s national cyber readiness team, known as USOM, flagged one of the IP addresses that the Landfall spyware connected to as malicious, which Unit 42 said supports the theory that individuals in Turkey may have been targeted.\nMuch like other government spyware, Landfall is capable of broad device surveillance, such as accessing the victim’s data, including photos, messages, contacts, and call logs, as well as the tapping of the device’s microphone and tracking their precise location.\nUnit 42 found that the spyware’s source code referenced five specific Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S22, S23, S24, and some Z models, as targets. Cohen said that the vulnerability may have also been present on other Galaxy devices, and affected Android versions 13 through 15. \nSamsung did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. Congressional Budget Office has confirmed it was hacked. \nCaitlin Emma, a spokesperson for CBO, told TechCrunch on Friday that the agency is investigating the breach and “has identified the security incident, has taken immediate action to contain it, and has implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems going forward.” \nCBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analysis and cost estimates to lawmakers during the federal budget process, including after legislative bills get approved at the committee level in the House and Senate. \nOn Thursday, The Washington Post, which first revealed the breach, reported that unspecified foreign hackers were behind the intrusion. According to the Post, CBO officials are worried that the hackers accessed internal emails and chat logs, as well as communications between lawmakers’ offices and CBO researchers. \nReuters reported that the Senate Sergeant at Arms office, the Senate’s law enforcement agency, notified congressional offices of a breach, warning them that emails between CBO and the offices could have been compromised and used to craft and send phishing attacks. \nIt’s unclear how the hackers gained access to the CBO’s network. But soon after news of the breach became public, security researcher Kevin Beaumont wrote on Bluesky that he suspected hackers may have exploited the CBO’s outdated Cisco firewall to break into the agency’s network.  \nLast month, Beaumont noted that CBO had a Cisco ASA firewall on its network that was last patched in 2024. At the time of his posting, the CBO’s firewall was allegedly vulnerable to a series of newly discovered security bugs, which were being exploited by suspected Chinese government-backed hackers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeaumont said the CBO’s firewall had not been patched by the time the federal government shutdown took effect on October 1. \nOn Thursday, Beaumont said that the firewall is now offline. \nThe CBO’s spokesperson declined to comment when asked about Beaumont’s findings.

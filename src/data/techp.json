    "body": "\nYouTube is conducting a “voluntary exit program” with severance for U.S.-based employees, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday. The news was first reported by Sources.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan told employees about the program via an internal memo on Wednesday.\nThe memo also announced that the Google-owned company was reorganizing its product teams into three separate organizations that all report directly to Mohan. The “Subscription Products” team will focus on YouTube’s subscription products across YouTube Music & Premium and OTT.\nThe “Viewer Products” team will focus on the viewer experience across the main YouTube app, YouTube Kids, Learning, Trust & Safety, and more. Last, the “Creator & Community Products” organization will focus on supporting creators and building community. \nThe company says no roles are being eliminated as part of these changes.\nThe move comes as Alphabet released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, reporting that YouTube’s advertising revenue hit $10.26 billion in the period, marking a 15% year-over-year increase.\n"

GM will also idle those battery factories starting on January 5, according to the Wall Street Journal, with plans to resume production in the middle of 2026.\nThe job cuts come just a few days after GM announced layoffs to some of its white-collar workforce and announced a $1.6 billion hit as it reworks its electric vehicle plans.\nGM also recently ended its BrightDrop commercial electric van program. The company — and many of its rivals — are pushing EVs less in the United States after the loss of the federal tax credit and the loosening of regulatory restrictions on internal combustion vehicles.\n"

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s X rival, continues to ship new features at a rapid pace. Shortly after the launch of communities and disappearing “ghost posts,” the social networking app on Thursday introduced new tools that will give users more control over their conversations on the platform.\nOne new feature, reply approvals, will allow you to decide which replies from other users will appear on your posts — before anyone else can see them.\nWhile Threads, like other social networks, already offers tools that let you limit replies to people you follow, your followers, or people you mention, the new feature allows you to keep your replies open to all without the negative consequences of having discussions derailed.\nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nAs the company explains, these tools will help you “set the tone of the conversation,” and give users more choice. It’s a unique way to balance users’ interest in engaging in more public conversations, but one where the poster — not those replying — still has the power. \nIn addition, the company is rolling out new Activity feed filters that will allow you to more easily view the replies from people you follow or those that include mentions. These join other options like Verified, Quotes, Reposts, and more as other ways to filter replies. \nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nMeta announced during its third-quarter earnings call this week that Threads has now reached 150 million daily active users, up from over 100 million in December 2024. In August, the company said the network had topped more than 400 million monthly active users, as well.\nAs the app grows, Meta has been working to quickly monetize its traction, having now rolled out ads on the platform globally.

    "description": "With Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as \"AirNode operators\" will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage.",
    "body": "\nNBA champion Tristan Thompson announced at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that he’s partnering with global telecom company World Mobile to launch a community-owned mobile network called Uplift. The network offers unlimited data plans starting at $9.99 per month.\nUplift is built on blockchain technology and a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN).\nWith Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as “AirNode operators” will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage. The idea behind Uplift is to challenge the $2 trillion telecom industry’s centralized model by allowing users and local operators to share in the value they create.\n“For me, it’s about, how can I help people that have walked the same life that I walked, and I think for us, what we’re doing is providing connectivity and connection for unlimited data at a way lower cost,” Thompson said onstage. “It’s like, how can I help my community have a better tomorrow? And that’s what this is about. And I’ve been very blessed and fortunate to have a team that understands this vision. And we want to help people in America, help the inner city, and just give people hope.”\nWhile Thompson is known for his basketball career and winning the NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he’s also an outspoken advocate for innovation and inclusion. Thompson currently holds four C-suite roles across the web3 and fintech landscape. He’s the chief digital equity officer at World Mobile and the chief advisory officer at AxonDAO, an AI-powered medical research platform inspired by his brother’s epilepsy journey.\nImage Credits:Getty Images for TechCrunch\nHe’s also the co-founder of Basketball Fun, a web3 platform that tokenizes NBA players, and he’s the chief content officer at Tracy AI, an AI platform for real-time sports analytics.\nWith this latest endeavor, Thompson and World Mobile are looking to drive affordable community-owned internet access. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWorld Mobile says this is a tested and scalable model, as it piloted it in Reno, Nevada, where community hosts have earned more than $10,000 annually by providing coverage to underserved areas. Uplift operates on infrastructure already proven through World Mobile’s U.S. deployments, World Mobile says.\n“We brought about 20% of Reno back to connectivity,” Thompson said. “When the hurricane happened in North Carolina and Asheville, Starlink went out there and tried to bring connectivity, and they weren’t able to, so they reached out to the World Mobile team, and we were able to get out there and send a couple of our guys on helicopters to fly in, and we were actually the ones that brought connectivity back to Asheville, North Carolina, during that hurricane.”\nThe new service will begin rolling out in Cleveland, Ohio, soon and will launch in additional cities in 2026.\nWorld Mobile notes that more than 50 million Americans live at or near the poverty line, with many lacking access to affordable high-speed data. Uplift aims to expand access while ensuring that wealth generated by mobile usage stays in the neighborhoods that create it.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIndia’s appetite for instant convenience — once confined to food and grocery delivery — is expanding into house help. That shift has helped Snabbit, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from $80 million five months ago.\nThe all-equity Series C round — Snabbit’s third fundraise in nine months — was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup’s total funding to $55 million.\nSnabbit’s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes.\nCurrently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals.\nSnabbit founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal with a few of its women experts.Image Credits:Snabbit\nSome of Snabbit’s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. “We’re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, ‘Hey, this was happening offline, and now we’ll do it online,’” said Agarwal.\nThe startup reports a 30% to 35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of “well below” ₹500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit’s services are priced at around ₹150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around ₹240 (roughly $3).\nWorkers on the platform earn between ₹25,000 and ₹30,000 (approximately $284 to $340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers.\nSnabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such as Broomees and Pronto. Urban Company now plans to double down on instant home services to stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge.\n“In a hyper-local business, you don’t win pan India, you don’t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,” Agarwal said.\nThe new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elder care.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe 2024 runner-up in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, geCKo Materials, returned to the stage at this year’s show to debut new products as it pushes deeper into commercializing its tech.\nFounder Dr. Capella Kerst revealed four new uses of geCKo’s super-strong dry adhesive: a semiconductor wafer handling tool, a robotic gripper for smooth surfaces (like solar panels or glass), a curved robotic “end effector” for more irregular shapes, and an all-purpose gripper for robotic arms.\nThe geCKo tech is inspired by the way real-life lizards use their feet to grip surfaces. Kerst positions it like a new form of Velcro, but one that leaves no residue, can quickly attach and detach, and requires no electrical charge or suction. A one-inch tile of the material can hold 16 pounds, and the geCKo dry adhesive can attach as many as 120,000 times — and can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or years.\nThe ability to quickly adapt the dry adhesive to existing manufacturing, picking, and other robotic applications has proven popular. Kerst’s company won over Ford, NASA, and Pacific Gas & Electric as customers before she even competed on last year’s Battlefield stage.\n“Has this year flown by as quickly for anybody else as it has for us?” Kerst said on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage on Wednesday. The geCKo CEO said her company has tripled the size of her team since last year’s show and completed an $8 million fundraise. And geCKo’s dry adhesive was used on six space missions in the last year — a testament to the material’s ability to work in multiple environments, including a vacuum, according to Kerst.\nOnstage Wednesday, Kerst showed off a Fanuc robotic arm using six geCKo tiles to quickly grab and move objects around, before showing videos of the other commercialized applications.\nIn one of those videos, Kerst showed geCKo’s material being used to safely move semiconductor wafers faster than current suction or vacuum tech allows.\n“Our customers at TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Kawasaki said we have a goal to [move the wafers] at 2Gs of acceleration,” she said. “We decided to blow them out of the water and do 5.4Gs of acceleration repeatedly, reliably, using geCKo materials.”  \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nCluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: You should be thinking harder about how to go viral.\n“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nBut he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. \n“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”\nCluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andreessen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.\nAs Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”\nFor Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Reputation is sort of a thing of the past,” Lee said. “You can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you’ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you’ve got Elon Musk going bats— crazy.”\n“You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” he continued, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic, and you have to be personal.”\nIt’s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, Lee demurred.\n“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said. “I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nWaymo and Zoox robotaxis are a regular sight on San Francisco streets, and soon Uber, through a partnership with Lucid and Nuro, will descend on the city as well. It is exactly how San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie likes it.\n“I think we should be the testbed for emerging technology and AI and healthcare tech — and all of it,” Lurie said Wednesday on the main stage of TechCrunch Disrupt. “We always have been, and under my leadership, we will continue to lead and lean in.”\nLurie added that he is proud of the success that Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle tech company, has had in the Bay Area. And, he said “we welcome others.”\nLurie was quick to say that safety comes first, adding that autonomous vehicles are regulated at the state level. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. But companies that want to offer and charge for robotaxi rides must also get permits from the California Public Utilities Commission.\nWhile Lurie is opening his arms to autonomous vehicles, other cities are more resistant. Boston, for instance, has considered a ban on autonomous vehicles in the city. \n“Waymo has proven out it is a safe ride,” he said, noting that the robotaxis have attracted tourists who come to the city to take a ride in the driverless vehicles. “We’re hoping it opens at the airport shortly, and can take people here into the city.”\nThat doesn’t mean there won’t be some resistance. For instance, the Teamsters Union has lobbied for restrictions on self-driving trucks in a bid to protect jobs. \nLurie, meanwhile, has taken a bullish view on tech and the money and jobs it can bring to the city. \n“We believe in the future,” he said. “The future starts always in San Francisco, and we’re going to lean into it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:44 PM PDT · October 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe rise of agentic coding tools has been a sea change for software engineers across the industry — but for Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, it seems to have landed particularly hard. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Yakovenko said he’s become increasingly comfortable taking a back seat in software development tasks.\n“AI has been a great force multiplier for somebody who’s an expert,” said Yakovenko, describing his experience with agentic coding after more than 15 years developing software. “Now I can just watch Claude churning through its thing and I can almost smell when it’s going off the rails.”\n“If people are in a meeting with me and I’m not paying attention,” he continued, “it’s because I’m watching Claude.”\nCo-founder of the Solana cryptocurrency protocol, Yakovenko has seen immense success this year, even as many cryptocurrencies have struggled. The system announced $2.85 billion in annual revenue earlier this month, fueled largely by crypto trading platforms. Even more impressive was the Solana coin’s first exchange-traded fund (or ETF), launched the day before Yakovenko took the stage. Launched by the crypto asset manager Bitwise, the fund saw nearly $70 million of inflows in a single day.\nOnstage, Yakovenko attributed the success to a growing acceptance of crypto, especially from the conventional finance industry. “If you are a back-office finance person, you actually get crypto much, much faster,” Yakovenko said. “Finance people deal with settlement risk all the time. They deal with banking risk all the time.”\nOver the same period, cryptocurrency has drawn significant new criticism for enabling public bribery, particularly in connection with the Solana-hosted Trumpcoin. The coin has directed an estimated $350 million to the president, which critics see as a form of bribery — particularly in the wake of Trump’s high-profile pardons for Tron founder Justin Sun and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\nBut as long as Solana is an open protocol, Yakovenko has little control over the coins it hosts. “I could send you an email with a link to Trumpcoin or Fartcoin,” Yakovenko explained onstage, “and both of those are protocols, both the email and the underlying protocol that creates that market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Each was selected to represent the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After all that intense pitching, we have a winner.\nThese startups were handpicked to compete in Startup Battlefield, and all of them presented a live demo in front of the VCs and tech leaders who judged the competition.\nAfter hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Charter Space, Glīd, MacroCycle, Nephrogen, and Unlisted Homes.\nThe final five made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, and Digg founder Kevin Rose. \nWe’re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is:\nWinner: Glīd\nGlīd (pronounced “Glide”) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company, founded by Kevin Damoa (pictured), has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks.\nRead more about Glīd in our separate post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nRunner-up: Nephrogen\nNephrogen is a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney.

    "body": "\nBox co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn’t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.\n “Generally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems — just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,” explained Levie.\n“If you’re doing something mission critical — we’ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn’t expect. So you want to have some sort of ‘church and state’ between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.”\nHe painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said. \nIn addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS. \n“The thing that I’m very convinced of is we’ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you’ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,” Levie said.\nAs a result, the typical “per-seat” business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents. \nThese changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes. \nSmaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.\nThis presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.\nHe encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building. \n“We are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is — there’s a complete platform shift happening in tech that’s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,” Levie said.\n“And I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave.\nFigma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company but didn’t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entrée Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman.\nFigma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform.\nWeavy’s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want.\nImage Credits:Figma\nUsers start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.\nThe startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation.\nImage Credits:Figma\n“This node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft.

    "body": "\nIn a push to expand its AI footprint in emerging markets, Google has partnered with billionaire Mukesh Ambani–led Reliance Industries to bundle its AI Pro subscription with Jio 5G plans at no extra cost.\nOn Thursday, Google announced a partnership with Reliance, India’s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity teamed up with Reliance’s archrival Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel’s 360 million subscribers.\nIndia, the world’s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier — a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.\nThe Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.\n“This partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,” the Indian telecom giant said.\nThe 18-month offer is valued at ₹35,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google’s AI Pro plan normally costs ₹1,950 (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.\nBeyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its tensor processing units (TPUs) in India. Reliance’s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations and will develop its own prebuilt AI agents for the platform.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Today’s announcement will put Google’s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India’s vibrant developer community,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement.\nAt its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announced partnerships with its investors Google and Meta to strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.\nEarlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.\nAI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also setting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world’s biggest emerging market.\nEarlier this year, Google offered Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.\nIndia has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as Google’s Nano Banana, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Anthropic’s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.\n“Through our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered — where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,” Ambani said.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor the last several months, nuclear startups have been raising large sums of money — well over $1 billion so far.\nData centers and their thirst for electricity have been one driving force. But recent changes to federal nuclear safety policies could be another accelerant that helps clear the way for speedy reactor development and at a potential cost to human and environmental health.\nThe Trump administration has quietly changed how the Department of Energy oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants built on its properties, according to a report from NPR. About a third of the rulebook has been axed, and several sections have been heavily revised. Previous requirements, including those aimed at limiting groundwater and environmental contamination, are now suggestions, and workers can be exposed to higher doses of radiation. Plant security protocols are now largely up to the company.\nThe new rules were developed without public comment or notice, according to NPR. They only apply to reactors built on DOE property; those built elsewhere are still subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Several startups are developing demonstration reactors on DOE property in the hopes of hitting a Trump administration deadline of July 4, 2026.\n"

    "body": "\nEarlier this month, Meta laid off 10% of the staff for Reality Labs, its virtual reality unit, reportedly cutting as many as 1,000 employees. Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.\nOn Wednesday, Meta’s earnings report showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.\nThose losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.\nDuring the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company’s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.\n“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,” Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. “I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,” Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would “likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.” \nWhen Meta announced a pivot toward the “metaverse” in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company faced harsh criticism — even being referred to as an “international laughingstock.” Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism hasn’t exactly subsided. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it’s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.\nLast week, CNBC reported that, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios — another sign that the company’s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be retiring its standalone Workrooms app — which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nTesla’s profit fell 46% in 2025 compared to the prior year, as CEO Elon Musk assumed a role in the Trump administration and federal electric vehicle subsidies were killed off by Congress, causing sales to plummet.\nThe electric vehicle company reported Wednesday that it recorded just $3.8 billion in profit across 2025, its lowest tally in years. Total revenue from car sales fell 11% year-over-year, too. Tesla already revealed that it shipped 1.63 million cars globally across 2025. That marks the second year in a row that its sales have declined, after Musk spent years promising average annual growth of 50%.\nInvestors largely expected the decline in sales in Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year results for 2025, and the company beat Wall Street’s estimates for earnings and revenue, sending shares up in after-market trading Wednesday. It’s been largely buoyed by strength in its other industries and investments, including energy capabilities and AI, as Tesla has continued to lure investors’ attention away from its stalled-out automotive business.\nThe company wrote in its shareholder letter: “2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company.” \nThe company revealed in the letter that it recently invested $2 billion in Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, part of the latter’s recent Series E funding round.\nRevenue from Tesla’s solar and energy storage businesses also grew 25% compared to 2024, and services revenue (which includes payments for Full Self-Driving software, insurance, parts, and Supercharging) grew 18%. The company was even able to grow its gross margin compared to prior quarters.\nLong-awaited projects like the Tesla Semi (first revealed in 2017) and the Cybercab (which debuted in 2024, but has been teased for years) are supposed to enter production in the first half of this year, according to Tesla.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has a lot of other projects on its plate, which were detailed in the shareholder letter.

This partnership involves further embedding of Anthropic’s AI models into ServiceNow’s platform for its customers and bringing Anthropic’s AI to its employees.\nServiceNow declined to clarify the duration of the partnership or the monetary size of the deal.\nThis deal entails making Anthropic’s Claude model family the preferred AI models across ServiceNow’s AI-driven workflow products. Claude is now also the default model powering the company’s AI agent builder, ServiceNow Build Agent, which allows developers to create agentic workflows and build apps.\nThe deal also involves the rollout of Claude to the company’s 29,000 ServiceNow employees. Claude Code, Anthropic’s vibe-coding product, is also available to the company’s engineers.\n“ServiceNow with Anthropic is turning intelligence into action through AI-native workflows for the world’s largest enterprises,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow, said in a company press release. “Together, we are proving that deeply integrated platforms with an open ecosystem are how the future is built.”\nThis news comes just a week after the company announced a new AI partnership with Anthropic rival OpenAI that involved giving ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI’s models through the company’s products.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nServiceNow president, COO and CPO, Amit Zavery, said the company is intentionally pursuing a multi-model strategy.\n“We don’t view these partnerships as competitive or mutually exclusive,” Zavery said over email. “Enterprise customers want model choice. They want the right model for the right job — keeping governance, security, and auditability consistent on the ServiceNow AI Platform. Each model brings different strengths, and our role is to orchestrate them in ways that deliver the best outcomes for customers.”\nThis deal is just the latest one for Anthropic, which has announced a number of sizable enterprise deals in recent months. The company announced a deal with global insurance provider Allianz earlier this year and partnerships with Accenture, IBM, Deloitte, and Snowflake late last year.\nWhile enterprises have struggled thus far to find a measurable return on AI investment, VCs recently predicted that this will change in 2026 — although this is the third year in a row they have predicted that.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft and OpenAI may have a notoriously rocky relationship but as OpenAI experiences never-before-seen revenue growth, Microsoft, one of its major investors, is benefiting greatly.\nWhen the software giant reported its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday, it dropped this rather large nugget in: Its net income increased by $7.6 billion from its investment in OpenAI.\nOpenAI reportedly has a 20% revenue share agreement with Microsoft (though neither company has ever publicly confirmed that). The software giant has invested more than $13 billion in the AI lab, which is currently looking to raise additional funding at a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nIn September, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated some of the terms of their deal when OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation.\nAs part of that deal, OpenAI agreed to buy another $250 billion of Azure services. That commitment shows on Microsoft’s books as “commercial remaining performance obligations,” or contracts that Microsoft has that have not yet been paid out. Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft said that 45% of that is from OpenAI.\nAnthropic got a shout-out in the quarterly earnings, too, in helping boost Microsoft’s anticipated future revenue in the form of commercial bookings, which grew 230%. In November, Microsoft announced that it was investing $5 billion into Anthropic and the AI lab had signed up for $30 billion of Azure compute capacity, with intent to buy more later.\nBut Microsoft is also spending big to feed the AI machine. It spent $37.5 billion in the quarter on capital expenditures, two-thirds of which were for what Microsoft called “short-lived” assets: primarily the GPUs and CPUs for its cloud Azure to serve AI.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company reported $81.3 billion in revenue (Wall Street analysts expected $80.27 billion, so that’s a solid beat), up 17% over the year-ago period. Its Microsoft Cloud revenue hit $50 billion this quarter for the first time. All of Microsoft’s business units increased by double-digit percentages over the year-ago quarter with the exception of Windows devices, which gained 1% (essentially flat), and Xbox content and services, which were down 5%.\n"

    "body": "\nLast year, Deezer introduced an AI detection tool that automatically tags fully AI-generated music for listeners and removes it from algorithmic and editorial recommendations. \nThe company announced on Thursday that it’s now making the tool available to other streaming platforms in an effort to help address the rise of AI and fraudulent streams, as well as promote transparency within the music industry and make sure human artists still get the recognition they deserve.\nAlongside the move, Deezer reported that 85% of streams from fully AI-generated tracks are deemed fraudulent. Notably, the service now receives 60,000 AI tracks per day, totaling 13.4 million AI-detected songs. By contrast, in June of last year, fully AI-generated music made up 18% of daily uploads, surpassing 20,000 tracks.\n​Deezer claims its AI music detection tool can identify every AI-generated track from major generative models like Suno and Udio. In addition to excluding AI-generated tracks from recommendations, Deezer’s tool demonetizes them and excludes them from the royalty pool, as the company aims to fairly compensate musicians and songwriters. \nThe tool’s accuracy is 99.8%, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n​Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says there has been “great interest” in the tool, and several companies have “already performed successful tests.” One such company is Sacem, the French management company that represents over 300,000 music creators and publishers, including David Guetta and DJ Snake.\n​The company didn’t provide pricing information or disclose which additional companies are interested in adopting the tool. A spokesperson told us that the cost varies based on the type of deal.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Deezer\n​There is increasing concern about AI companies using copyrighted material to train their models, as well as about methods being used to manipulate streaming systems and commit fraud. \nOne instance of music streaming fraud occurred in 2024, when a North Carolina musician was charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with creating AI-generated songs and using bots to stream them billions of times, resulting in more than $10 million in stolen streaming royalties. Additionally, AI bands like The Velvet Sundown have gained millions of streams.\n​Bandcamp recently got fed up and banned AI-generated music altogether, while Spotify has updated its policy to address the rise of AI tracks, clarifying when AI is used in music production, reducing spam, and explicitly stating that unauthorized voice clones are prohibited on the platform.\nBy contrast, major record labels have resolved lawsuits with Suno and Udio, appearing to embrace AI-generated music. Last fall, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group struck deals with these AI startups to license their music catalogs, ensuring artists and songwriters are compensated when their work is used to train AI models.\n​In recent years, Deezer has taken significant steps to address concerns about AI-generated music. In 2024, it became the first music streaming platform to sign the global statement on AI training, joining actors Kate McKinnon, Kevin Bacon, Kit Harington, Rosie O’Donnell, and other notable creatives. \n​Hopefully, Deezer’s latest decision to sell its detection tool will set a precedent for other music streaming platforms to take similar actions to defend human artists and fight fraud.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nFrom the outside, Upwind Security looks like it’s had a smooth journey so far. Just four years in, the cloud security startup is now worth $1.5 billion, and boasts the likes of Siemens, Peloton, Roku, Wix, Nextdoor and Nubank among its clientele. But if you ask the company’s co-founder and CEO Amiram Shachar, the journey to get here was anything but certain.\n“Three years ago, we would spend hours asking ourselves if we were heading in the right direction, and 80% of the time, it felt like we weren’t,” a candid Shachar told TechCrunch in an interview following the startup’s recent $250 million Series B. \n“At the beginning, we constantly questioned whether the market needed our solution, whether it would be too hard to integrate into larger systems, or if customers would adopt it,” he recalled. “Developing a new approach was difficult; people are used to installing certain agents on machines, but they don’t like doing it.”\nUpwind likes to call that approach “runtime” security: Prioritizing alerts and remediation efforts around threats and vulnerabilities in active services in real time. As Shachar puts it, it’s an “inside-out” take on cloud security, where internal signals like network requests and API traffic function as context to help security teams separate urgent risks from those that can wait. \nDeveloping that approach wasn’t easy, however, as Shachar and his co-founders didn’t have a traditional background in security: they first built and sold a cloud compute brokerage called  Spot.io, to NetApp for around $450 million in 2020. \n“After joining NetApp post the Spot acquisition, I experienced first-hand how difficult cloud security really is,” Shachar said. “The security team would scan our environment and report issues, but they lacked critical context. Coming from a DevOps background, we (Shachar and his team) understood the infrastructure deeply, while security teams often didn’t know how APIs were exposed or which packages were running. As a result, they flagged many issues that weren’t real risks.”\nBut Shachar and his team felt they had better insight into cloud environments because they were running them. “The dominant approach was agentless, an ‘outside-in’ model where you scan environments externally,” he explained. “It’s easy to deploy, but it creates a lot of noise because you can only see what’s visible from the outside.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe team realized that the context provided by internal signals would be more useful to security teams, as they’d get to see what was happening in the network, in real time. But selling their new take on cloud security proved challenging, as security teams often lack permission to deploy software internally and default to more traditional tools. \nSo Upwind sales took time. “It wasn’t clear at first, and there was a lot of uncertainty; customers were hesitant,” Shachar said.\n“But we saw something others didn’t,” he explained. “Inside-out isn’t an advanced option; it’s the only way to solve the next generation of problems. With ephemeral infrastructure like containers, serverless workloads, AI agents talking to each other, and data constantly moving through APIs, you simply can’t map this from the outside. It has to be inside.”\nStill, the company had to contend with an overcrowded security market. Security teams were already overwhelmed by the number of tools, and customers didn’t want multiple products just to manage cloud security. “From the beginning, it was clear that Upwind would need to build a broad, integrated platform,” Shachar said. “Otherwise, customers wouldn’t engage or allow us to deploy our technology.”\nThe company’s logic eventually spoke to its target customers: large, data-intensive organizations with sizable cloud footprints. Since its $100 million Series A in 2024, Upwind has grown rapidly, posting 900% year-over-year revenue growth and doubling its customer base. The company has also expanded from its core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Israel to emerging markets including Australia, India, Singapore, and Japan. \nThe $250 million Series B was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and Picture Capital. The fresh cash will be used for product development and go-to-market motions, and the startup plans to invest in its AI security capabilities within its core cloud security platform and “extend its approach closer to developers to help prevent misconfigurations before they reach production.”\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nMark Zuckerberg spoke about his ambitions for Meta’s AI smart glasses business during Meta’s Q4 2025 earnings call on Wednesday.\nAfter pivoting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is doubling down on its production of AI wearables, as well as its own AI models.\n“Billions of people wear glasses or contacts for vision correction. And I think that we’re at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”\nHe added that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, and he believes that they’re “some of the fastest growing consumer electronics in history.”\nTake Zuckerberg’s outlook with a grain of salt. After all, he also thought that we would go to work and hang out with our friends in the metaverse — legs optional — and that didn’t work out.\nBut based on how tech’s biggest players are allocating their money and effort, it does seem like AI glasses are poised for a big moment, even if it’s not on the scale of the smartphone.\nGoogle is expected to launch a line of smart glasses this year, following a $150 million deal with Warby Parker. Apple is also reportedly planning to unveil smart glasses in the next year or two, moving some staff to that project instead of working on a lighter Vision Pro, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Snap announced Tuesday that it would spin its AR glasses, Specs, into a new subsidiary to allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEven OpenAI, a company that has not yet ventured into hardware, is pursuing AI wearables, though it seems more focused on something like an AI pin or earbuds, rather than glasses. Apple is also rumored to be working on an AirTag-sized AI device — though hopefully those efforts turn out better than the Humane AI pin.\nFor now, Meta is leading the way in pushing smart glasses to market, with several different models already on sale. That includes Oakley smart glasses designed to be worn while exercising, which is the most promising use case we’ve personally seen for these devices thus far.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nMark Zuckerberg says Meta users will start to see new AI models and products from the company in a matter of months.\n“In 2025, we rebuilt the foundations of our AI program,” Zuckerberg said on an investor call Wednesday, referring to the company’s recently restructured AI lab. “Over the coming months, we’re going to start shipping our new models and products… and I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the new year.”\nBut while Zuckerberg didn’t give specific timelines or products, he highlighted AI-driven commerce as a particular area of focus for Meta.\n“This also has implications for commerce,” Zuckerberg continued. “New agentic shopping tools will allow people to find just the right set of products from the businesses in our catalog.”\nThat proposal echoes broader interest in AI-powered shopping assistants across the industry. Both Google and OpenAI have built platforms for agent-enabled transactions, with companies like Stripe and Uber signed on as partners.\nBut while other AI labs have already built significant technical infrastructure, Meta believes its access to personal data will prove uniquely valuable.\n“We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn December, Meta acquired the general-purpose agent developer Manus, which provides similar technology. At the time, Meta said it would “continue to operate and sell the Manus service, as well as integrate it into our products.”\nThe investor call was timed to the release of Meta’s most recent quarterly earnings, which also disclosed a significant increase in new infrastructure spending. The company now anticipates that it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on overall capital expenditures over the course of 2026, up from $72 billion in 2025.\nIn its official filing, Meta attributed the jump to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.”\nWhile significant, the figure still falls short of the projected $600 billion that Zuckerberg reportedly projected for Meta’s infrastructure spending through 2028.\nMeta has previously drawn criticism from investors for failing to clearly state how its massive AI investment will translate to the company’s bottom line. But while details are still thin, Zuckerberg made it clear that the AI lab’s work would reach the public soon.\n“This is going to be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward,” he told investors.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nOuttake, which makes an agentic cybersecurity platform to help enterprises detect, investigate, and take down identity fraud, has raised a $40 million Series B round of funding.\nWhile that might not sound like a lot given the huge sums some AI companies are raising, the names involved in this financing reads like a tech industry who’s who.\nThe round was led by Iconiq’s Murali Joshi, who helped lead the firm’s investments in companies like Anthropic, Datadog, Drata, 1Password, among others.\nAngels who invested include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora; Pershing Square Holdings CEO Bill Ackman; Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar; Anduril co-founder Trae Stephens; Former OpenAI VP Bob McGrew; Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and Former AT&T CEO John Donovan. Whew!\nThe reason for the excitement? Outtake, founded in 2023 by a former Palantir engineer, Alex Dhillon, has found a way to automate what has largely been the manual problem of spotting and taking down digital identity posers: impersonation accounts, malicious domains posing as the company’s, rogue apps, fraudulent ads, and more. This problem has grown even more difficult because AI has enabled attackers to be more convincing and faster in their efforts.\n“We kept hearing whispers in our network about an AI company that was finally solving digital misrepresentation at scale. Honestly, we were skeptical,” Joshi told TechCrunch. “Historically, detection and takedown was (and to some extent even today) a manual, human-intensive process that couldn’t keep up with the speed of the internet.”\nBut once Iconiq looked at the product and did its due diligence with customers, the investor became a believer, he said. “They’ve turned a ‘human problem’ into a ‘software problem.’ Seeing AI take down digital frauds in real time is a game-changer for brand safety,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDhillon told TechCrunch his experience at Palantir is what led him to gaining so many notable angels. “I worked directly for Shyam Sankar at Palantir when I was part of the experimental product team,” he explained. This led him to meet many of the Palantir powers, current and former, including Stephens, who worked there in its earlier years. (Stephens is also a VC for Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.) One introduction led to another which led to moguls writing checks.\nOuttake names among its customers OpenAI, Pershing Square, AppLovin, and federal agencies. OpenAI even profiled the company in July 2025 as an example of an agentic startup built on its reasoning models.\nThe company says it has seen major growth all around, with annual recurring revenue increasing sixfold year-over-year and its customer base growing more than tenfold. Last year alone, Outtake says, its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks. \n"

    "description": "An unidentified bidder submitted a Hail Mary offer that was \"substantially higher\" than the winning bid at auction. Founder Austin Russell has been circling a bid, but it's not clear he was behind it.",
    "body": "\nMoments before a bankruptcy judge was expected to approve the sale of Luminar’s lidar business, an unidentified party submitted an offer that apparently blew away the leading bid of $33 million.\nThis bid, which emerged just before a hearing Tuesday, kicked off a series of rapid-fire meetings between Luminar’s remaining leadership team and its lawyers, a “special transaction committee” formed to navigate the bankruptcy, and eventually the company’s full board.\nWhile the bid was “substantially higher,” there were “infirmities” in the offer, according to a lawyer for Luminar. The company ultimately decided to stick with the $33 million bid it received from MicroVision during an auction on Monday.\nThe identity of who submitted this long-shot offer was not revealed, but Luminar’s lawyer said it was an “insider purchaser,” meaning it likely came from company founder Austin Russell.\nRussell had already tried to buy the company late last year before it slid into bankruptcy (and after he abruptly resigned as CEO). Representatives of his new firm Russell AI Labs previously told TechCrunch he was interested in submitting a bid on the lidar business during the bankruptcy case. (Those same representatives did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.)\nThe hearing moved forward, and the sale to MicroVision was approved. The sale of Luminar’s semiconductor division to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. was also approved. \nThe transactions are likely to close in the coming weeks, and after that, the company will cease to exist, bringing an end to one of the buzzier suppliers of the budding autonomous vehicle era.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhat MicroVision wants\nRussell’s goal of using lidar to help cars drive themselves will continue on at MicroVision, according to its CEO Glen DeVos. As part of the asset sale, MicroVision will get Luminar’s lidar tech as well as its remaining staff, and he said he’s hopeful some of the other talent that was laid off prior to bankruptcy will come on board, too.\nFor DeVos, Luminar’s lidar technology is the piece MicroVision has been missing from his company’s portfolio. The Redmond, Washington-based company doesn’t have the same profile as the leaders in the lidar sector like Aeva, Innoviz, Hesai, or Ouster, but that’s in part because it lacked the long-range sensing capability that is crucial to automotive.\nMicroVision has a “very strong” software team, DeVos said in an interview with TechCrunch, and a similarly strong short-range lidar team. But DeVos, who spent a long career at automotive suppliers Delphi and Aptiv, and took over as MicroVision CEO last year, wants to expand beyond its current markets of industrial use, security, and defense.\n“So when we look at the Luminar engineering team, and what they’ve done, we said: ‘Hey, that’s a great compliment from an engineering capability standpoint,’” Devos said. “That’s critical in this area in terms of trying to win automotive business.”\nDeVos said he’s hopeful that MicroVision can take Luminar’s existing commercial engagements with automakers — even the ones in tatters, like the contract with Volvo — and use those as a springboard into automotive, which would represent a huge new pool of potential revenue for his company.\n“I’ve been in the automotive industry a long time. I have experience where contractual relationships have gone off the rails, and basically, worked very hard to put those back together. We’re going to look at every single one of those. We’re not going to assume any of them are beyond saving,” he said. “You never want to get there, but, you know, there’s ways of putting those pieces back together.”\nA second mystery bidder?\nWhile the sale approval is behind him, Tuesday’s offer wasn’t the first time DeVos and MicroVision found themselves up against a mysterious bidder.\nDuring the hearing, lawyers for Luminar and Rich Morgner, a managing director at Jeffries (which was helping run the sale process), revealed that another unidentified party was forming a bid as far back as January 12.\nThat bid was problematic from the jump, Morgner said. At first, the party’s financing was coming from a “Chinese national company.” When Luminar expressed concerns about regulatory approval, Morgner said the bidder replaced its funding with three different non-Chinese sources.  \n“One was family money, which we were ultimately able to verify. The second was an SPV under the Caymans, which had a brokerage statement showing a round number of funds. And then we also had a European family office that was also part of the financing syndicate,” he said.\nWhile the lawyers and bankers were able to verify the “family money” was dependable, Morgner said the large round number in the Caymans SPV seemed suspicious.\n“The concern was the money came in … [so] money could come out. It wasn’t like looking at a long, dated brokerage statement, where you could see the ebbs and flows in the various different securities,” he said. Proof of funds from the European family office source was also never provided.\nLuminar’s lawyers never revealed the identity of the bidder, or whether it was the same party that submitted the offer that disrupted Tuesday’s hearing.\n"

    "body": "\nThree weeks ago, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, revealed it raised $20 billion in a Series E funding round. Now we know Tesla is among its investors.\nTesla disclosed in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns Musk’s social media company X. Other previously disclosed investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”\nThis is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a nonbinding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per Bloomberg’s reporting at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.\nTesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument, in its shareholder letter and during its earnings call, in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.\n“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”\nTesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk confirmed last year, and the company has included the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles. Bloomberg also reported that xAI told investors it plans to build AI for humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.\nMusk noted that there are many tasks Tesla can do internally. “But if there are things xAI can help accelerate our progress, then why should we not do that?” he asked. “And that is the reason why we’ve gone ahead with such an investment. Because this is part of the strategic initiative.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit fell 46% last year.\n“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.\nThe investment is expected to close in the first quarter. \nMusk and Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja signaled during the company’s earnings call it expect other capital expenditures that support its mission. \n“This year for Tesla is the first major steps as we increase vehicle autonomy and begin to produce Optimus robots at scale — we’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on the call. “So this is going to be a very big capex here; that is deliberate, because we’re making big investments for an epic future.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAI data-labeling startup Handshake has acquired data label-auditing startup Cleanlab, the companies tell TechCrunch.\nHandshake began in 2013 as a platform for hiring college grads and launched a human data-labeling business about a year ago to serve foundational AI model companies. Cleanlab, founded in 2021, is a startup that provides software for improving the quality of data produced by human labelers.\nThe deal’s purpose is primarily to acquire talent, aka an acqui-hire, adding nine key Cleanlab employees to Handshake’s research organization. This includes the startup’s co-founders, who earned their PhDs in computer science from MIT: Curtis Northcutt (pictured above), Jonas Mueller, and Anish Athalye. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed (though, as we previously reported, sometimes an acqui-hire can be surprisingly lucrative for founders.)\nCleanlab has raised a total of $30 million from investors, including Menlo Ventures, TQ Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Databricks Ventures. At its peak, the startup had more than 30 employees.\nCleanlab’s researchers are experts in developing algorithms that flag incorrect data without a second human reviewer. The goal is to improve the quality of the data Handshake produces for AI labs.\n“We have an in-house research team that thinks a lot about where our models are weak, what data should we be producing? How high quality is that data?” Sahil Bhaiwala, chief strategy and innovation officer at Handshake told TechCrunch. “The Cleanlab team has been focusing on this problem for years.”\nNorthcutt, the Cleanlab CEO who’s credited with pioneering its automated data-labeling auditing, said the company received acquisition interest from other AI data-labeling companies. But the startup chose to sell to Handshake because, he said, data-labeling competitors, including Mercor, Surge, and Scale AI, frequently use Handshake’s platform to source human experts such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists for their data-labeling projects.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“If you’re going to pick one, you should probably pick the source, not the middleman,” Northcutt told TechCrunch.\nHandshake, which was last valued at $3.3 billion in 2022, was forecasted to end 2025 at $300 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) and is reportedly on track to reach an ARR of “high hundreds of millions” this year. The company has provided data for eight top AI labs, including OpenAI.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

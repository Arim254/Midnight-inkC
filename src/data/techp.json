The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “Your Custom Feed.” \nThe new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want.\nFor those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. \nInstead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future.\nWhile it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options.\nYouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024. The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia.\nA Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month.\nThe report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million.\nAdditionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix.\nThe report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO.

After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web.\nThe company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month.\nAt the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity, and others.\nOpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January.\nUnfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

Only about three in 1,000 potential deposits end up becoming commercially viable, and it can take years to prove it by drilling core samples. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days.\nThe startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours.\nThe Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide. Fleet Space said the results of lithium deposits might extend beyond Cisco’s current boundaries, saying the region has “district-scale potential.”\n"

Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. \nDuring these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text.\n\nYou can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed.You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time.Rolling out to all users on mobile and web.

    "body": "\nChinese autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai said Tuesday it plans to triple the size of its robotaxi fleet by the end of next year as its pace of growth — and aspirations — accelerates. \nThe company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.\nPony.ai, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.\nThe company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber.\nThe ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period.\nShares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report. \nPony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees. \nThe company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024. \nPony.ai had $587.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, an amount that has decreased from $747.7 million in the second quarter of the year. Pony.ai said half of that decrease was from a one-off cash outflow that included investment into its joint venture with Toyota to support the production and deployment of its Gen-7 vehicle. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nWarner Music Group (WMG) announced on Tuesday that it has reached a deal with Suno, settling its copyright lawsuit against the AI music startup. WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.”\nWMG also announced that it has sold Songkick, a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business.\nWMG says Songkick will continue as a fan destination under Suno.  \nAs a result of WMG’s partnership, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models that will replace its current ones next year. Downloading audio from the service will require a paid account, while users on the free tier will be limited to playing and sharing songs made on the platform.\nWMG’s artists and songwriters will also have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices, and compositions are used in new AI-generated music.\nArtists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more.\n“This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.”\nThe news comes a week after WMG settled its copyright lawsuit with AI music startup Udio and entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026. \nWMG’s settlements with Suno and Udio mark a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI. Last year, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment sued Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. While WMG has settled its lawsuits with Suno and Udio, Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are also reportedly in talks to license their work to Udio and Suno and settle their lawsuits against the startups. \nIn a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno announced last week that it raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless.\nThe companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit.\nImage Credits:Uber/WeRide\nRobotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin.\nUber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. \nThe launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center.\n“Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. \nUber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThose partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro.\nThese deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai.\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company’s third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. \nUber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week.\nThe change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all.\n“Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.”\nInteractive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted.\nOn the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move.\n“I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote.\nAnother said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots. Unlike Stories, chatbots directly interact with users in open-ended conversations and can send unprompted messages even when users aren’t actively using the app. \nCharacter.AI’s decision to age-gate chatbot access comes at a time when California recently became the first state to regulate AI companions. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced a national bill that would ban AI companions for minors altogether.\n“I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told TechCrunch last month.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "description": "An easy-to-exploit vulnerability in a jury system made by Tyler Technologies exposed the personally identifiable data of jurors, including names, home addresses, emails, and phone numbers.",
    "body": "\nSeveral public websites designed to allow courts across the United States and Canada to manage the personal information of potential jurors had a simple security flaw that easily exposed their sensitive data, including names and home addresses, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nA security researcher, who asked not to be named for this story, contacted TechCrunch with details of the easy-to-exploit vulnerability, and identified at least a dozen juror websites made by government software maker Tyler Technologies that appear to be vulnerable, given that they run on the same platform. \nThe sites are all over the country, including California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.\nTyler told TechCrunch that it is fixing the flaw after we alerted the company to the information exposures.\nThe bug meant it was possible for anyone to obtain the information about jurors who are selected for service. To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be brute-forced since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.”\nIn early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. Inside that portal, TechCrunch saw full names, date of birth, occupation, email addresses, cell phone numbers, and home and mailing addresses.\nOther exposed data included information shared in the questionnaires that potential jurors are required to fill out to see if they are qualified to serve on a jury.\nIn the portal seen by TechCrunch, the questions asked about the person’s gender, ethnicity, education level, employer, marital status, children, if the person was a citizen, whether they were older than 18, and whether they have been convicted or faced indictment for a theft or felony. \nThe vulnerability could have exposed personal health data inside a juror’s profile in some cases. For example, if a juror had requested to be exempted from service for health reasons, they may have disclosed what medical reason they think disqualifies them. TechCrunch saw an example of that, too.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about vulnerabilities in Tyler Technologies’ products? Or other government tech? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nTechCrunch alerted Tyler of the issue on November 5. Tyler acknowledged the vulnerability on November 25.\nIn a statement, Tyler spokesperson Karen Shields said that the company’s security team confirmed “a vulnerability exists where some juror information may have been accessible via a brute force attack.”\n“We have developed a remediation to prevent unauthorized access and are communicating next steps with our clients,” the statement said.\nThe spokesperson did not respond to a series of follow-up questions, including whether Tyler has the technical means to determine if there was any malicious access to jurors’ personal information, and whether it plans to notify people whose data was exposed. \nThis is not the first time Tyler left sensitive personal data exposed on the internet. In 2023, a security researcher found that, due to a separate security flaw, some U.S. online court record systems exposed sealed, confidential, and sensitive data, such as witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse, and corporate trade secrets. \nIn that case, Tyler fixed vulnerabilities in its Case Management System Plus product, which was used across the state of Georgia. \nTwo other government technology providers were exposing data in that case: Catalis, through its CMS360 product, a system used across several U.S. states; and Henschen & Associates, through its CaseLook court record system, used in Ohio.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe batteries that power Rad Power Bikes’ e-bikes “pose a risk of serious injury and death” and owners should stop using them, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).\nThe warning, issued Monday by the CSPC, is due to a risk that the batteries can ignite or explode. The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission.\n“The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. \nThe battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding.\nThe CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. \nRad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” \nThe company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity. The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.” (The Verge first reported Rad Power’s disagreement with the CPSC.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRad Power claimed its batteries comply with “the highest industry standards” and said the “incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent.” \n“While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products,” the company told TechCrunch in an email. \nOwners can find out if they have batteries covered by the warning on the CPSC warning page. The commission is telling customers not to throw the lithium-ion batteries away, nor take them to traditional recyclers. Instead, they should take the batteries to “municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center[s].”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\n“When people see it, they say, ‘that’s it?… It’s so simple.’”\nThat’s how OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes how he thinks people will respond to seeing the company’s forthcoming AI hardware device for the first time. \nThe device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless” and pocket-sized.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco.\nAlthough OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.”\nMost notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. \nHowever, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes.  \n“I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.\nThe vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted. \nThe device he described should be able to filter things out for the user, as the user would trust the AI to do things for them over long periods of time. It should also be contextually aware of when it’s the best time to present information to the user and ask for input. \n“You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,” Altman added. \nIve confirmed at the event that the device should be available in under two years. \n“I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity,” Ive told Powell Jobs in the interview. “And I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly — that you use them almost without thought — that they’re just tools,” he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nItalian company Bending Spoons flew largely under the radar — until last month. In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion, up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024.\nBending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses.\nAndrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant.\n“Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.  \nDumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital, according to Dumont.\n“Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said.\nIn 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSince then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel.\n“It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it. These funds get old, and these companies just sit there,” Dumont said. “We provide liquidity and also reset these companies for profitability.”\nAlthough Dumont didn’t disclose how much he paid for UserVoice, he said that stagnant companies sell for a fraction of the valuation commanded by healthy SaaS startups, which typically sell for 4x annual revenue or more. Based on our conversation, we estimate that “venture zombies” sometimes sell for as low as 1x yearly revenue.\nBy implementing cost-cutting and price increases, Curious can push these businesses to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins almost immediately. “If you have a million-dollar business, you’re kicking off $300,000 in earnings,” he offered as an example. \nThey achieve the turnarounds because, unlike the stand-alone companies, they can centralize functions like sales, marketing, finance, and other admin roles, across all of their portfolio companies. “We’re not trying to sell the businesses we acquire and don’t need VC-scale exits, so we can balance growth and profitability more sustainably,” Dumont said.\nWhen asked why VCs don’t urge their startups to be profitable like Curious does, Dumont responded by saying: “Investors don’t care about earnings; they only care about growth. Without it, there’s no VC-scale exit, so there’s no incentive to operate with that level of profitability.”\nThe cash generated from Curious’ companies is then used to buy other startups, Dumont said.  \nThe firm plans to buy 50 to 75 startups like UserVoice over the next five years, and Dumont is certain he won’t have a shortage of targets to choose from. Curious is focused on acquiring startups that generate $1 million to $5 million in recurring revenue annually, a segment of the software market that, according to Dumont, private equity shops and secondary investors have historically ignored.\n“We’ve been doing this for a little under two years now, and we’ve probably looked at at least 500 companies, and we bought five,” Dumont said.\nWhile Bending Spoons’ big valuation hike may validate the “venture zombie” acquisition model, Dumont doesn’t expect a lot of new competition. Turning profits out of stagnation isn’t easy. “It’s a ton of work,” he said.\n"

    "body": "\nSpeechify has largely been a tool that helps you listen to articles, PDFs, and documents. The company is now adding voice detection features to its Chrome extension, including voice typing and a voice assistant that answers your questions.\nIn the last 12 months, there has been a proliferation of voice detection tools, thanks to overall quality improvement in speech recognition models. Speechify is hitching its wagon to this train and launching its own dictation tool with support for English. Just like other dictation tools, Speechify’s voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words.\nIn my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify’s tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well. The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually.\nImage Credits:Speechify\nIn terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like Wispr Flow, Willow, and Monologue. Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease.\nThe startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.”\n\n\n\nWhile ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center. \n“We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That’s what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini. We know from several years of building Speechify that there’s a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne notable hiccup with this is that Speechify’s assistant doesn’t currently work with browsers with in-built sidebar assistants like OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Dia. The startup is not too worried about that as the extension is largely intended for Chrome and its massive user base.\nSpeechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually.\nThe startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn’t reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company. Other companies like Truecaller and Cloacked have been chasing similar targets.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWith news that Discord is kicking the tires on going public soon, other tech companies are starting to take their chances. Liftoff Mobile filed its first S-1 document late Tuesday, the first step in the process.\nThe company isn’t yet discussing how big this IPO will be: It has not yet filled in any data about the size of the offering or the stakes held by its principal shareholders. However, the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.\nAnother interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.\nLiftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.\n"

The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, Cerebras said.\nThe deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also reported the deal size.\nBoth companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI’s customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as “broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.”\nCerebras has been around for over a decade but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia’s offerings).\nCerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but since then has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to raise large amounts of money. On Tuesday, it was reported that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, is already an investor in the company and that OpenAI once considered acquiring it.\n“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,” said Sachin Katti of OpenAI in the company’s post. “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "body": "\nAs part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.\nIn addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before, but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.\nThese deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. \nThe foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top-ten most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.\n“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” \nIn addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 PM UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels. \nThe organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The update is rolling out on desktop starting today.\nThe Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.\nThe redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration. \nImage Credits:Google\n​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.\nA Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.\n​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nWhatsApp is allowing AI providers to continue offering their chatbots to users with Brazilian phone numbers, days after the country’s competition regulator ordered the company to suspend its new policy that bars third-party, general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the app via its business API.\nUnder the new policy, the company is providing a 90-day grace period starting January 15 to developers and AI providers, mandating them to cease responding to user queries on the chat app, and notify users that their chatbots won’t work on WhatsApp. \nNow, Meta told developers that they don’t have to notify users with Brazilian phone numbers (with code +55) of any changes or cease offering their services, per a notice to AI providers seen by TechCrunch. \n“The requirement to cease responding to user queries and implement pre-approved auto-reply language (mentioned below) before January 15, 2026, no longer applies when messaging people with a Brazil country code (+55),” the notice reads.\nWhatsApp did not immediately respond to a query seeking to confirm the decision.\nThe policy, which goes into effect from today, impacts general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok on the platform. Notably, the policy does not stop businesses from providing customer service via bots within WhatsApp to their customers. \nIn its notice, Brazil’s competition agency said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta has previously provided a similar exemption to users in Italy after the country’s competition agency took issue with the policy in December. Separately, the EU has also opened an antitrust investigation into the new rules.\nThe company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.\n“These claims are fundamentally flawed,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in response to CADE’s probe on Tuesday. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform.” \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNetflix is increasing its investment in video podcasts, with its latest projects featuring famous comedian Pete Davidson and former football player Michael Irvin.\nThe streaming giant announced on Wednesday two original video podcasts coming to the platform: Irvin’s “The White House,” streaming on January 19, and “The Pete Davidson Show,” debuting on January 30. \nBoth series, available only to Netflix subscribers, are designed to leverage the star power of their hosts. Davidson already has two comedy specials on the service that have performed well for the streamer. Meanwhile, Irvin was a big focus in Netflix’s documentary series “America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys.” \nDavidson’s show will feature candid, behind-the-scenes conversations with friends from his own garage, airing every Friday, while Irvin’s show will deliver in-depth sports news, analysis, and commentary twice a week, joined by notable guest co-hosts like former NFL All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. \nThese originals will join Netflix’s growing slate of video podcasts, alongside licensed titles from iHeartMedia, Spotify, and Barstool Sports such as Dear Chelsea, My Favorite Murder, and The Ringer. Notably, as part of these licensing agreements, these shows aren’t available in full on YouTube. \nWednesday’s news comes at a time when Netflix is increasingly trying to challenge YouTube’s dominance in the podcast space, with viewers watching over 700 million hours of podcasts per month on living room devices in 2025.\nHowever, Netflix is still in the early stages of developing its podcast library.

    "body": "\nIndia’s top court has ruled against Tiger Global in a tax case stemming from its Flipkart exit during Walmart’s 2018 takeover, a decision that strengthens New Delhi’s ability to challenge offshore treaty structures and could raise tax risk for global funds counting on predictable exits from one of the world’s fastest-growing major markets.\nOn Thursday, the Indian Supreme Court backed the tax authorities in a dispute over whether Tiger Global could use its Mauritius-based entities to claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty and avoid paying capital gains tax in India on profits linked to its exit in the Walmart–Flipkart deal. The decision set aside a 2024 Delhi High Court ruling that had overturned a 2020 order by the Authority for Advance Rulings, which had found the firm was, prima facie, avoiding tax and therefore not eligible for treaty relief.\nThe ruling is being closely watched by investors, as it strengthens India’s hand in challenging offshore “treaty-routing” structures that have long been used to reduce tax on high-value exits. It could also raise uncertainty over how future cross-border deals are structured and priced, at a time when foreign funds are counting on India as a key growth market.\nIn its verdict, a two-judge bench said (PDF) that when a transaction appears, at first glance, to be designed to avoid income tax, India’s advance-ruling mechanism cannot be used to seek protection.\nTiger Global first invested in India’s e-commerce firm Flipkart in 2009 with an initial $9 million investment, before increasing its exposure to about $1.2 billion over multiple funding rounds, TechCrunch had reported earlier. The firm later sold its stake to Walmart for about $1.4 billion in 2018.\nThe tax dispute centers on how Tiger Global structured that investment — through entities in Mauritius — and whether those vehicles could claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty to shield capital gains from Indian tax.\nWhile selling Flipkart’s stake during Walmart’s $16 billion deal, Tiger Global sought a certificate allowing no tax to be withheld, arguing that because the shares were acquired before April 1, 2017, the gains were exempt from Indian capital gains tax under a “grandfathering” clause, protecting older investments from the newer tax regime, in the India–Mauritius double taxation avoidance agreement. Indian tax authorities rejected the request in 2020, questioning the offshore structure chosen by the investment firm.\nThe Supreme Court bench framed the dispute as an issue of sovereign taxing powers, warning against structures that are designed primarily to dilute that authority.\n“Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right of that country,” the bench said, adding that “any dilution of this power through artificial arrangements is a direct threat to its sovereignty and long-term national interest.”\nThe judgment should be read as a caution against aggressive tax planning rather than a wholesale dismantling of the India–Mauritius treaty framework, Ajay Rotti, a tax expert and founder and CEO of tax advisory firm Tax Compass, wrote on X. He said the decision reinforces a broader shift toward “substance over form”, signalling treaty protection may not apply automatically where offshore entities lack real commercial activity.\nTiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm can seek a review of the verdict, though such petitions are rarely successful.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nBerlin-based Parloa has raised $350 million in Series D funding from existing investors, valuing the six-year-old customer service AI startup at $3 billion. The round comes just eight months after the company raised $120 million at a $1 billion valuation.\nThe new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from returning backers including EQT Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Durable Capital, and Mosaic Ventures.\nParloa is one of many startups developing AI agents that promise to automate the kind of customer service work previously handled by human representatives and help desk staff.\nThe company’s competitors include Sierra, co-founded by OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, which raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation in September; and Decagon, reportedly in talks to raise capital at a valuation of upwards of $4 billion. Other companies working to replace human agents with AI include older players Intercom and Kore.ai, as well as the U.K.-based PolyAI, which raised an $86 million round at a $750 million valuation last month.\nMalte Kosub, Parloa’s co-founder and CEO, doesn’t seem fazed by the competition, largely because he doesn’t believe this is a “winner-take-all” category. “In the end, it is one of the biggest opportunities that has ever existed in software,” he told TechCrunch.  \nIndeed, Parloa and its rivals are vying to automate a significant portion of the global customer support workforce, which Gartner estimates at 17 million contact center agents worldwide.\nBut it’s not just the size of the market that gives Kosub confidence about Parloa’s ability to win. He pointed to the startup’s massive fundraise as a sign that it could be among the top leaders in the space. “There are a lot of companies out there, but you need to look at the scale and the amount of funding they got,” he said. “The number of competitors is decreasing significantly.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast month, Parloa said that it was generating annual recurring revenue of more than $50 million, but that’s not meaningfully ahead of Poly AI, which expected to end 2025 with ARR of $40 million, or Decagon, which is reportedly making “significantly more” than $30 million in ARR. Still, Kosub seems convinced that being so well capitalized will help his startup get ahead.\nParloa’s AI agents are already answering calls for large enterprise customers, which include Allianz, Booking.com, HealthEquity, SAP, Sedgwick, and Swiss Life, but the CEO says the goal is to do more than just build software that “picks up the phone.”\nThe company will invest a significant portion of its new capital into building a “multi-model, contextual experience” that will allow personalized AI agents to recognize a customer’s identity and specific needs, whether they reach out via an app, a website, or a phone call.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEthereal Exploration Guild, an Indian space tech better known as EtherealX, has climbed 5.5x in valuation to $80.5 million after its latest funding round. The startup is developing a launch vehicle designed to be fully reusable and is readying engine hot-fire tests ahead of its first technology demonstration flight, planned for 2027.\nThe Bengaluru-based company confirms that it closed an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital, as TechCrunch reported earlier. Accel, Prosus, YourNest, BlueHill, Campus Fund, and Riceberg Ventures also participated, EtherealX said. The raise follows a $5 million seed round in August 2024 that valued the startup at $14.6 million.\nAs India pushes to mature its space ecosystem beyond small launchers and component contracts — targeting growth in its space economy to $45 billion from $8 billion over the next decade — EtherealX is among the  startups drawing attention.\nSatellite operators worldwide are looking for more launch capacity and scheduling flexibility in a market where SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has set the benchmark for pricing and cadence. EtherealX is aiming for that space with its fully reusable vehicle designed to return both the booster and upper stage. That’s an approach that, if proven, could cut per-launch costs and increase flight frequency without relying on a native constellation to keep rockets fully booked.\nEtherealX is developing two engines in-house: the 80-kilonewton “Pegasus” upper-stage engine and the 1.2-meganewton “Stallion” booster engine, with hot-fire tests targeted for June–July. Thrust, measured in kilonewtons and meganewtons, indicates how much lifting force an engine can generate.\nThe startup is targeting a November–December 2027 launch window for a technology demonstration vehicle, ahead of commercial missions expected to begin toward the end of 2028, co-founder and CEO Manu J. Nair said in an interview.\nRocket engineers also track specific impulse, a widely used proxy for fuel efficiency, which — along with thrust — helps determine how much payload a vehicle can carry for a given amount of propellant.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Pegasus engine produces 323 seconds of vacuum-specific impulse and uses what the startup describes as a proprietary “full-flow segregated cooling cycle.” The engine integrates an in-house additively manufactured turbopump. Furthermore, the Stallion booster engine uses a gas-generator cycle and delivers 306 seconds of sea-level specific impulse.\nEtherealX’s additively manufactured turbopump assembly designed for the upper-stage engineImage Credits:EtherealX\nNair told TechCrunch that EtherealX plans to cluster multiple engines per stage for its main medium-lift vehicle, called Razor Crest Mk-1, with nine Stallion engines on the booster and 15 Pegasus engines on the upper stage.\nFor comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 primarily reuses its first-stage booster while expending the upper stage. EtherealX is targeting deeper reusability by designing its vehicle to return both the booster and the upper stage.\nEtherealX’s vehicle aims to carry up to 24.8 tonnes in an expendable configuration, 22.8 tonnes partially reusable, and about 8 tonnes when fully reusable. The startup is targeting pricing of $350 to $2,000 per kilogram over time, Nair said, depending on configuration and cadence.\nTo support development, EtherealX operates a rocket engine test site in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, known as Base 001, which Nair said is focused on upper-stage engine qualification. The startup has also secured a 150-acre manufacturing and testing campus in Andhra Pradesh’s proposed space city that it expects to become operational from mid-2026 for integrated engine and stage testing.\nEtherealX has signed launch memoranda of understanding totaling around $130 million with customers, including Japan’s SpaceBD and Taiwan’s space agency, TASA, Nair said, as it seeks early commercial demand ahead of its first demonstration flight.\nThe latest funding will be used to complete flight qualification of the Stallion booster engine and to run clustered-firing tests of the Pegasus upper-stage engines, Nair said. To support that ramp-up, the startup currently employs 67 people and expects to grow to about 90 over the next two months as it increases manufacturing capacity and moves to a higher testing cadence ahead of its first demonstration flight.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFormer OpenAI exec Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, is saying goodbye to two of its co-founders, both of whom are headed back to OpenAI. Another former OpenAI staffer who went to work for Murati’s startup is also headed back to the company.\nOn social media on Wednesday, Murati announced the departure of Barret Zoph, the company’s co-founder and CTO. “We have parted ways with Barret,” Murati said in a post on X. “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility.”\nMurati’s announcement made no mention of other departures.\nJust 58 minutes after Murati’s announcement of Zoph’s departure, Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, announced that Zoph would be headed back to OpenAI. “Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team,” Simo wrote on X.\nMetz is another co-founder of Thinking Machines and previously worked for OpenAI for a number of years on the company’s technical staff. So did Schoenholz, whose LinkedIn profile still lists him as working for Thinking Machines.\nZoph previously worked for OpenAI as VP of research, and before that, worked for six years at Google as a research scientist. Murati, who served as the CTO of OpenAI until September 2024, left the company and co-founded Thinking Machines with Zoph and Metz. The startup, where Murati serves as CEO, has amassed significant financial support since then, closing a $2 billion seed round last July, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, as well as Accel, Nvidia, AMD, and Jane Street, among others. The round valued the company at $12 billion.\nTechCrunch has reached out to both Thinking Machines and OpenAI for comment. Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs wasn’t amicable. Certainly, it’s telling that Murati didn’t write more in her public messaging about his departure from the company.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile talent moves between AI giants are common in Silicon Valley, the departure of co-founders from a startup less than a year after its founding is particularly notable. The loss of two co-founders simultaneously — especially when one served as CTO — could be perceived as a particularly meaningful setback for Thinking Machines, which had assembled a high-profile team of former OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI researchers.\nThe company has also lost other key personnel, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who left to join Meta in October. OpenAI itself has seen numerous co-founders depart to launch or join competing ventures, including John Schulman, who left for Anthropic in August 2024 before joining Thinking Machines as Chief Scientist as its launch in February of last year.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nOver the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out. \n“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit. \nChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.\nFor anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.  \nSomani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.  \nSince Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process. \nThe revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOn Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”\n“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.\nAnother driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization. \nFor Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.” \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThe Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday it has finalized an order that bans General Motors and its OnStar telematics service from sharing certain consumer data with consumer reporting agencies. The finalized order, which comes a year after the agency reached a proposed settlement with GM, also requires the automaker to be more transparent with its consumers and obtain their explicit consent on any data collection.\nThe finalized order comes nearly two years after a New York Times report showed how GM and OnStar collected, used, and sold drivers’ precise geolocation data and driving behavior to third parties, including data brokers LexisNexis and Verisk. The data was collected through GM’s Smart Driver program, a free feature contained within its connected car apps that tracked and rated driving behaviors and seatbelt use. Data brokers sold this information to insurance providers, which could affect customers’ rates, the NYT reported at the time.\nGM discontinued the Smart Driver program in April 2024 across all of its brands, citing customer feedback. GM said at the time it unenrolled all customers and ended its third-party telematics relationships with LexisNexis and Verisk.\nThe FTC alleged that GM and OnStar used a misleading enrollment process to get consumers to sign up for its OnStar connected vehicle service and OnStar Smart Driver feature. The FTC also alleged the automaker failed to clearly disclose that the data would be collected and sold to third parties.\nUnder the order finalized Wednesday, GM is also required to obtain explicit consent from consumers prior to collecting, using, or sharing connected vehicle data. This process occurs at the dealership when a consumer buys a car from a GM brand. At that point, the OnStar system is linked to that particular vehicle VIN number and the new owner is asked whether they agree or not with data collection, according to GM.\nThere are some exceptions to the data collection ban, however. GM is allowed to share location data with emergency first responders and for internal research, the FTC said. GM confirmed this, noting it collects data for internal research and development and sometimes shares de-identified, or anonymized data (not associated with specific drivers or vehicles) with select partners to enhance city infrastructure and improve road safety. For instance, data has been shared with the University of Michigan, which used it for urban planning. \nGM must also establish a way for all U.S. consumers to request a copy of their data and seek its deletion and give them the ability to disable the collection of precise geolocation data from their vehicles. GM says it has already complied with these mandates.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGM says it began overhauling its policies and programs on data collection and privacy in 2024. For instance, the automaker said it has consolidated many of its U.S. privacy statements into a single, simpler statement and expanded its privacy program that allows customers to access and delete their personal information.\n“The Federal Trade Commission has formally approved the agreement reached last year with General Motors to address concerns,” an emailed statement from GM reads. “As vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly integral to the driving experience, GM remains committed to protecting customer privacy, maintaining trust, and ensuring customers have a clear understanding of our practices.” \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nFive years from now, the world might start running short on copper, the critical mineral used in everything from data centers to electric vehicles. Absent any changes, the world could face a severe shortfall as early as 2040, with demand exceeding supply by as much as 25%. \nIf copper seems expensive today, just wait a few years. \nCompanies and investors have been pouring money into the sector as demand ramps up. AI minerals startup KoBold, for example, raised $537 million last year to exploit a copper deposit it found in Zambia.\nBut with a little help from some microbes, today’s copper producers might be able to beat the shortage. One startup, Transition Metal Solutions, says it has found a way to boost copper production by 20% to 30% using additives to boost the microbes’ performance. Think of it as prebiotics for copper mines.\nTo scale up its technology, Transition Metal Solutions has raised a $6 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Transition Ventures with participation from Astor Management AG, Climate Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, Essential Capital, Juniper VC, Kayak Ventures, New Climate Ventures, Possible Ventures, SOSV, and Understorey Ventures.\nMicrobes have always been key players in the copper world, helping the metal break out of its mineral form so that we can refine it into pure metal. Companies have been working for years to coax microbes into squeezing more copper out of ore, but according to Sasha Milshteyn, co-founder and CEO of Transition, they’ve been going about it the wrong way.\nTypically, companies isolate or engineer strains that show promise in boosting copper production. They grow large quantities of them and pour them over an ore heap, where the microbes soak in and get to work.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“That by and large hasn’t paid off,” Milshteyn told TechCrunch. “Often they will see kind of a boost early on and then it just kind of falls off — or they don’t see any boost at all.”\nMilshteyn suspects that part of the problem is that microbes aren’t solo actors. It’s like casting a star without a supporting cast. Microbes live in diverse communities where each plays a role. Bumping up the population of one strain can only do so much.\nAnother part of the problem is that we’ve only scratched the surface on understanding microbes in ore heaps. “When you look into the microbial community that’s present in the material, typically well over 90% of it are things that we’ve never seen before,” Milshteyn said\nConditions inside a heap leach, as the acid-laced piles of ore are called, are challenging to replicate in a lab. The pH is low, around two, and there are clays and other metals floating around, all of which undermine the usual molecular tools scientists use to understand microbial communities.\n“Everything that the industry has done has really focused on that tiny fraction that people have been able to grow in the lab,” he said. “Typically, it’s in the 5% range that you can culture.”\nSo instead of trying to isolate a few star performers, Transition is working to raise the entire community up. The company applies low cost, mostly inorganic compounds that are already found at mining sites.\n“What we’re focused on is not necessarily boosting one or two species, but we’re we are trying to nudge the community towards the higher functional state,” he said. “We’ve observed that in the lab.”\nIn lab samples that Transition has applied its proprietary cocktail to, the startup has been able to extract 90% of the copper from the ore, up from 60% using traditional methods. \nOutside of the lab, Milshteyn expects the efficacy to drop a bit, though not by much. Traditional heap leaches extract around 30% to 60% of the copper in the ore. He thinks Transition can bring that up to at least 50% to 70%, maybe as higher. \nEach mine has a different microbial community, so Transition plans to tailor its additives based on initial testing. As the company gathers more data, Milshteyn thinks that eventually he and his team will be able to predict what a mine needs in advance.\nAt that rate, the company’s prebiotics could solve the copper shortage before it starts. But first, Transition has to show the mining industry that its solution works. The company plans to work with a third-party metallurgy lab that’s known within the mining world. “Without third party results, nobody’s going to believe you,” Milshteyn said. Money from the seed round should cover that phase of testing.\nAfter Transition has proven it works in the lab, then it’ll apply its treatment to a demonstration heap containing tens of thousands of tons of material. With luck, it’ll then deploy its technology at copper mines around the world.\n“We’re leaving 65% of material behind” at typical mines, Milshteyn said. “We may as well get as much out of it as we can.”\nUpdate 8 am PT: The article previously referred to Transition’s additives as probiotics instead of prebiotics.\n"

    "body": "\nAs AI automates parts of the workforce, Emversity, an Indian workforce-training startup, is building talent pipelines for roles it sees AI can’t replace, and has raised $30 million in a new round to expand job-ready training in the world’s most populous market.\nThe all-equity Series A round was led by Premji Invest, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Z47, the Bengaluru-based startup announced on Thursday. The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.\nIndia has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have continued to flag a shortage. Hospitality, too, has faced a 55% to 60% demand-supply gap for workers, according to industry estimates.\nEmversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.\nThe two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.\nEmversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.\nSinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.”\nSinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter.\n“AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.”\nEmversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers.\nThe startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said.\nHe added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year.\nWith the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said.\nTo deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care.\nLast year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said.\nWhile Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand.\nEmversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network.\n"

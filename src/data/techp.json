    "body": "\nTesla has filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Motor Vehicles in an attempt to overturn an agency ruling. The state DMV ruled that Tesla used deceptive marketing to overstate the automated driving capabilities of its vehicles, thereby violating state law.\nThe lawsuit reignites an issue that appeared to be resolved last week when the DMV said it would not suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days. This was because the EV maker complied with the ruling and stopped using the term “Autopilot” in its California marketing materials. CNBC was first to report the lawsuit.\nThe DMV could have taken action against Tesla. It chose not to even though an administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s licenses for 30 days as a penalty. Instead of pulling its licenses, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply. \nAnd Tesla did, although in the most extreme ways. Tesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot; in January it discontinued Autopilot altogether in the U.S. and Canada. Perhaps it regrets that decision and is looking for a way to bring it back.\n"

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, Anthropic unveiled its new enterprise agents program, its most aggressive push yet to integrate agentic AI into everyday workplaces. \nIn an official briefing, Anthropic’s head of Americas, Kate Jensen, told reporters that the new system would finally deliver on the promise of agentic AI. “2025 was meant to be the year agents transformed the enterprise, but the hype turned out to be mostly premature,” Jensen said. “It wasn’t a failure of effort. It was a failure of approach.”\nUnder the new program, companies can use the plug-in system to deploy pre-built agents to help with common enterprise tasks, including financial research and engineering specifications. The result is a major opportunity to grow Anthropic’s enterprise client base — and a significant threat to SaaS products currently performing those functions. \n“We believe that the future of work means everybody having their own custom agent,” Anthropic product officer Matt Piccolella told TechCrunch.\nMuch of the enterprise agents program draws on previously announced technology, particularly Claude Cowork and the plugin system, which was announced in research preview on January 30th. The systems launched today are largely focused on making those tools easier to deploy within a company, including private software marketplaces, controlled data flows, and customized plugins. The result is a system for deploying Claude-powered agents with the same controls a corporate IT department would expect when deploying software.\n“Admins want to be able to have really, really, really tailored workflows and skills for their specific organization,” Piccolella said. “And this allows the admin of a Claude Cowork organization to be able to do this in a very centralized way.”\nThe stock plugins included at launch take aim at particular departments present within most companies, including agents designed for finance, legal, and HR departments. Each plugin includes basic skills common across different companies, although Anthropic expects that companies will modify each plugin to bring it in line with unique needs and customs.\nIn the case of finance, the stock plugin gives Claude the basic information and data flows necessary to perform market and competitive research, financial modeling, and other common tasks for finance teams. The HR plugin includes skills for generating job descriptions, onboarding materials, and offer letters, among others.\nThe launch also includes a number of new enterprise connectors, including integrations for Gmail, DocuSign, and Clay, among others. Previously unavailable, these connectors will allow agents to pull in data and context directly from the linked system. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "description": "Meta is buying billions of dollars in AMD AI chips in a multiyear deal tied to a 160 million-share warrant, deepening its push to diversify beyond Nvidia and expand data center capacity.",
    "body": "\nMeta plans to purchase potentially up to $100 billion worth of AMD chips, enough to drive roughly six gigawatts of data center power demand, the companies announced Tuesday.\nAs part of the multiyear agreement, AMD has issued Meta a performance-based warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock — or about 10% of the company — for $0.01 each, structured to vest alongside certain milestones. The full stock award is conditional on AMD’s share price, which would need to hit $600 for Meta to receive its final tranche, per The Wall Street Journal. AMD’s stock closed at $196.60 on Monday.\nUnder the agreement, Meta will purchase AMD’s MI540 series of GPUs and its latest generation of CPUs. CPUs are increasingly becoming a core pillar of the AI inference compute stack because they’re efficient, easier to scale, and don’t tie companies solely to Nvidia. \n“The CPU market is absolutely on fire,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday morning during an investor briefing. “There is significant demand. It has continued to grow, and it really is a result of the AI infrastructure deployments as inferencing scales, as agentic AI scales, and our portfolio is in an extremely good position.”\nAMD has been slowly gaining ground as AI firms look to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, which has been the longstanding leader in AI chips and has charged a premium for the title. Last October, AMD and OpenAI struck a similar deal trading equity for an agreement to buy chips. \nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the firm’s partnership with AMD is “an important step” as it diversifies its compute and works towards “personal superintelligence.” Zuckerberg has defined personal superintelligence as AI systems designed to deeply understand and empower individuals in their everyday lives. \nMeta has pledged to invest at least $600 billion in U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure over the next several years, including a projected capital expenditure spend of $135 billion in 2026. Meta recently unveiled plans for a $10 billion gas-powered data center campus in Indiana designed for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck a multiyear deal to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs. The Facebook-maker is also working on its own in-house chips but has reportedly hit delays.\nThis article has been updated with more information from AMD CEO Lisa Su. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nOura announced on Tuesday that it’s launching its first proprietary AI model to enable its AI chatbot, Oura Advisor, to deliver personalized insights around women’s health. The company says the model supports questions spanning the full reproductive health spectrum, from early menstrual cycles through menopause. \nThe new model is rolling out in Oura Labs, the company’s opt-in, experimental feature hub within the Oura app. \nOura says the new model draws on established medical standards, research, and knowledge sources reviewed by its in-house team of board-certified clinicians and women’s health experts. It also integrates biometric signals and long-term trends to deliver personalized guidance.\nAs people are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for health guidance, from cycle changes to perimenopause symptoms, Oura says there is a need for models designed specifically for women. \nImage Credits:Oura\n“This custom model is a fundamental shift in how we responsibly deploy AI in health to meet the needs of our members,” said Ricky Bloomfield, MD, chief medical officer at Oura, in a press release. “Women’s health is too complex—and too often overlooked—to rely on one-size-fits-all systems. By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health, pairing rigorous science with the lived, longitudinal data that makes Oura uniquely powerful.”\nThe launch of the new women’s health AI model comes as Oura chief commercial officer Dorothy Kilroy told TechCrunch last October that the company’s fastest-growing user segment isn’t gym rats, it’s women in their early twenties.\nWhen a user asks Oura Advisor a women’s health question, the chatbot prompts the new model to reference its research and knowledge sources while also analyzing the user’s relevant biometric signals across sleep, activity, cycle and pregnancy data, stress, and more. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe new model is intentionally designed to be non-dismissive, reassuring, and emotionally supportive, the company notes. However, it’s not designed to be a doctor, as users shouldn’t use the chatbot for a diagnosis or treatment plan. \nOura says the model is hosted entirely on Oura-controlled infrastructure, and that conversations are never shared or sold. \nUsers who want to access the new model can opt into Oura Labs by navigating to the drop down menu on the upper left corner of the Oura app. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFintech giant Marquis is suing its firewall provider SonicWall, claiming that an earlier breach allowed hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewalls that led to a ransomware attack on Marquis’ network.\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, seeks a jury trial. It claims the 2025 breach at SonicWall “exposed critical security information for Marquis and every customer that used SonicWall’s firewall cloud backup service.”\nMarquis’ chief executive Satin Mirchandani told TechCrunch in a statement that SonicWall allegedly failed to secure its backup service, which caused the company to suffer “significant reputational, operational, and financial harm.”\nNews of the lawsuit comes weeks after TechCrunch reported that Marquis was planning to seek compensation from SonicWall. The Plano, Texas-based fintech giant had told its customers that it blamed SonicWall for allowing hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewall configuration files, including its own.\n“SonicWall allowed a threat actor to obtain the keys to bypass that line of defense and walk right into Marquis’s internal network, the very thing that SonicWall’s firewall was supposed to prevent,” reads the complaint.\nFirewalls are meant to prevent unauthorized access to a company’s network, but Marquis alleges that the hackers who scrambled its network with ransomware used information stolen from SonicWall about how its customers configure their firewalls, including emergency passcodes (known as scratch codes) that allowed access to Marquis’ internal network.\nMarquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, said the hackers took “personally identifiable information concerning customers of some of Marquis’s financial institution clients” in its cyberattack.\nThe stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, including bank account, debit, and credit card numbers, as well as customers’ Social Security numbers\nA spokesperson for SonicWall did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.\nSonicWall first admitted a breach of its systems in mid-September, in which it said fewer than 5% of its customer firewall configuration backup files were exfiltrated from its storage servers, hosted on Amazon’s cloud and maintained by SonicWall. The firewall maker in October conceded that in fact every customer had their firewall backup files stolen in the breach. \nMarquis in December 2025 began notifying affected people that its networks had been breached that August. SonicWall has not said when hackers were first able to gain access to its systems. \nIt’s not yet clear what caused the breach at SonicWall. In its complaint, Marquis claims SonicWall made a code change to one of its APIs months earlier, in February 2025, that “created a vulnerability exploitable by threat actors.” Marquis said that this bug allowed the hackers to access customer firewall configuration backup files “without proper authentication” by guessing predictable firewall serial numbers.\n“While we were able to secure our network and client data quickly, our investigation revealed that our exposure to threat actors was due to SonicWall’s network breach and failure to notify us that our firewall protection was potentially compromised,” Mirchandani, the Marquis CEO, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.\nMirchandani told TechCrunch that SonicWall has not yet provided any non-public information about the root cause of its breach. \n“We hope to learn more through the litigation process,” Mirchandani said.\nMarquis still will not say how many individuals are affected by its data breach. According to a listing with the Texas’ attorney general, at least 400,000 people across the U.S. are known to be affected by the fintech giant’s breach. \nThe number of affected individuals is anticipated to rise as more data breach notifications are filed with various U.S. attorneys general.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "description": "The number of people affected by a data breach at government contractor giant Conduent is growing, as millions of people continue to receive notices warning them that hackers stole their personal data.",
    "body": "\nThe spillover from a ransomware attack on one of the largest government contractors in the United States keeps getting bigger: more than 25 million people have now had personal data stolen in the hack.\nConduent provides printing, mailroom services, and document and payment processing services for state government benefit operations, such as food assistance, as well as workplace and unemployment benefits for large corporations. As such, the company handles a large amount of personal information belonging to a large swath of the United States. Conduent says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people.\nBut since the January 2025 cyberattack attack, which a ransomware group claimed credit for, the corporate giant has said little about the data breach, such as how it was caused and how many people are affected.\nAn update to the state of Wisconsin’s data breach notification page now shows the Conduent breach affects at least 25 million people across the United States.\nTechCrunch’s ongoing tally from various data breach notification letters that we have seen also amounts to about 25 million people, with Oregon (10.5 million) and Texas (15.4 million) accounting for the majority of those affected. Other data breach notices seen by TechCrunch include another few hundred thousand individuals across Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington.\nThe breach is known to have compromised individuals’ names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, and medical data.\nConduent has said little outside of its data breach notifications, and in some cases has made it more difficult for affected individuals to learn about the breach.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA page on Conduent’s website, titled “Incident Notice” that was published in October 2025 at the same time as its first data breach notification, does not explicitly mention a cybersecurity incident. The page contains a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which tells search engines to not list the page in search results, making it difficult for anyone searching the web to find it.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins would not say how many notifications the company has sent to date, or why the company is hiding its incident notice from search engines.\nConduent’s breach has been billed as one of the “largest ever,” but likely trails behind the Change Healthcare hack, which affected more than 190 million people following a ransomware attack in February 2024. A Russian-speaking ransomware gang stole reams of health and medical data from Change Healthcare using a stolen credential that wasn’t protected with multi-factor authentication, prompting the healthcare tech giant to pay at least two ransoms to keep most of the stolen data off the internet.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo is opening its robotaxi services to the public in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, as the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company quickens its pace of expansion.\nWaymo’s rollout will mimic its public launches in previous cities. Select riders who have downloaded the Waymo app will receive an invitation to take their first rides, starting Tuesday. New riders will be added on a rolling basis, and eventually anyone who downloads the app will be able to hail a ride.\nThe addition of the new cities adds a striking dimension to Waymo’s fast-paced push to expand. Last February, Waymo was operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix and some of its surrounding suburbs, parts of Los Angeles, and San Francisco. At the time, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo was providing more than 200,000 rides every week.\nOver the past 12 months, Waymo has expanded in its existing markets, particularly in San Francisco, where its service area now stretches down Highway 101 through numerous towns, all the way to San Jose. It now has access to three airports, including San Francisco International. It has launched a service in partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. It has expanded its operating domain to freeways in three cities. And last month it opened its robotaxi service to the public in Miami.\nWaymo tends to hold back on its latest ridership numbers. The last time it provided an update, Waymo said it was providing more than 400,000 rides per week, though the actual number is likely higher by now. \nWaymo doesn’t appear to be slowing down, either. It is planning to launch robotaxi services in several more cities this year, including Denver, London, and Washington, D.C., to name a few. And it is now armed with an additional $16 billion raised in round led by Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital that values Waymo at $126 billion.\nWaymo currently has a fleet of about 3,000 robotaxis that are spread across its six markets of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. That fleet size will likely grow with the addition of these four new cities, but don’t expect it to balloon immediately.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said it will have dozens of vehicles to start in these cities, and will scale up in coordination with riders over the coming months.\nThe company’s workforce will also scale alongside this expansion. The staff who monitor the robotaxis and respond to specific requests for information from the Waymo self-driving system — for instance, if a robotaxi encounters a tricky scenario on public roads — may expand, although Waymo wouldn’t share specifics. The company said only that it has an extensive planning process to ensure that its operations are right-sized to its scale as it grows. Waymo recently revealed it employs about 70 of these workers, whom it describes as remote assistance workers, or RAs.\nAll of this is pushing toward a lofty goal Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana laid out last year — and one that hasn’t changed even as the company faces increased scrutiny and investigations by safety regulators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation after one of Waymo’s robotaxis last month struck a child at 6 miles per hour near a school in Santa Monica. The National Transportation Safety Board is also examining how Waymo robotaxis behave around school buses.\n“Waymo is serving more riders than ever, as we are on track to serve over one million rides per week by the end of this year,” said Mawakana said in a blog post Tuesday, adding that the company is laying the groundwork for robotaxi service in more than 20 cities.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

Canva said that Cavalry’s tooling will add to the existing capabilities of Affinity, Canva’s professional creative editing suite for photos, vectors, and layouts, which it acquired in 2024\nCanva revamped Affinity’s design last year and made it free for all users. The company said that since then, people have downloaded the software over five million times. Affinity has the capabilities of photos, vector, and layout editing. With this acquisition, Canva wants to add motion editing to its suite.\n“By bringing Cavalry alongside Affinity, we’re closing that [motion editing] gap and unlocking a complete professional suite spanning photo, vector, layout, and now motion editing,” the company said in a blog post. “Together, these tools form the foundation of a full-stack Creative OS for professional work, while preserving the depth and control professional creatives rely on,” it added. \n\n\n\nBesides Cavalry, Canva has also acquired stealth startup MangoAI, which was working on building reinforcement learning systems to improve video ad performance, according to its website. Canva said that the startup’s first product helped clients create and launch ads and observe outcomes to improve future campaigns.\nMangoAI was built by Nirmal Govind, former Vice President of Data Science & Engineering at Netflix, and Vinith Misra, a former data scientist at Netflix and Roblox. Canva said that Govind will become Canva’s first ” Chief Algorithms Officer” and Misra will work on improving Canva’s marketing products.\nIn January 2025, Canva acquired marketing intelligence startup Magicbrief and later last year, it launched a growth tool called Canva Grow for asset creation and performance measurement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMangoAI Co-Founders Nirmal Govind (left) and Vinith Misra (right) together with Canva Co-Founder and COO, Cliff Obrecht (centre).Image Credits: Canva \nDuring a sit-down at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch that Canva Grow is doing “incredibly well,” especially when it comes to creating static content and publishing it to Meta platforms.\n“It is quite an early product, but we’ll soon be launching a lot more things around video creation, deploying across multi platform,” Obrecht had said. “So it’s very early, but it’s very much got a very loyal small user base, but a lot of big brands are spending money, and then we’re scaling up massively.”\nWith the new acquisitions, the company wants to bolster its position as a marketing solution by potentially adding video creation and more granular measurement.

    "body": "\nCompanies are increasingly launching software to build and monitor AI agents in an effort to get enterprises to adopt AI. New Relic is no different. As the data observability company launches an AI agent platform of its own, it knows it isn’t the only game in town.\nNew Relic on Tuesday unveiled a no-code agentic platform that lets enterprises put together data observability AI agents that monitor a company’s data to catch bugs and issues before they disrupt products. Called New Relic Agentic Platform, it lets companies deploy pre-built agents and manage existing bots as well. \nIt also supports the model context protocol (MCP), which connects AI applications to external data sources, and integrates with other New Relic tools.\nNew Relic isn’t looking to be the only platform that companies use to manage and deploy all of their AI agents, Brian Emerson, the startup’s new chief product officer, told TechCrunch. Instead, the aim is to offer clients the same agent-building capabilities they are getting elsewhere for observability as well.\n“We’re not building this as general purpose,” Emerson said. “We’re building it for outcomes that we care about inside observability. It’s also a world that allows us to work with the rest of the ecosystem or tools that exist out there, but bring it back into the context of problems we’re trying to solve around our personas and the observability domain.”\nSoftware that lets users manage AI agents has proliferated in recent months as companies look to figure out how to quell enterprises’ fears about giving AI agents access to their data and software.\nSalesforce was arguably the first to release an agent platform in late 2024, calling it Agentforce. OpenAI launched its own version of the technology, OpenAI Frontier, earlier this year. Research organization Gartner has called such agent platforms “necessary infrastructure” and a critical component of getting enterprises to adopt AI.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSticking with the theme of increasing enterprise tech adoption, New Relic also revealed new tools focused on OpenTelemetry (OTel), an open-source observability framework.\nThe company said its application performance monitoring (APM) agents are now equipped with OTel capabilities, letting enterprises manage OTel data streams alongside their other data sources in one place. This is aimed at solving a previous fragmentation problem that was holding up mass enterprise adoption of the OTel framework.\n“Just send your OTel data to us,” Nic Benders, chief technology strategist at New Relic, said. “What we’ve discovered in this process is that it’s kind of a burden for a lot of teams out there in the world to run all of the OTel [data] collectors. So having a OTel like fleet management is something that’s very important.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nThe generative AI music tool ProducerAI will become part of Google Labs, the company announced on Tuesday.\nBacked by The Chainsmokers, the ProducerAI platform allows users to write natural language requests — something like “make a lofi beat”– to generate music. It uses Google DeepMind’s Lyria 3 music-generation model, which can turn text and even image inputs into audio outputs.\nGoogle announced last week that its Lyria 3 capabilities would be introduced into the flagship Gemini app, but ProducerAI makes it possible for users to communicate with the AI model more like it’s a “collaboration partner,” to use the words of Elias Roman, Google Labs’ Senior Director of Product Management.\n“ProducerAI has allowed me to create in new ways,” Roman wrote in a blog post. “I’ve experimented with new genre blends, expressed how I feel with personalized birthday songs for my loved ones, and made custom workout soundtracks for myself and friends.”\n\n\n\nGoogle also shared that three-time Grammy-winning rapper Wyclef Jean used the Lyria 3 model and Google’s Music AI Sandbox on his recent song “Back From Abu Dhabi.”\n“This is not just a machine where you’re clicking a button a hundred times, and then you’re done. It’s a careful kind of curation where you’re going through and saying, ‘Oh, I think that’s something we can use,’” said Jeff Chang, Director of Product Management at Google DeepMind, in a video the company put out.\nJean recalls wanting to know what a flute would sound like in a track he already recorded, and being able to use Google’s tools to quickly add a flute sound to the mix. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“What I want everybody to understand […] is you’re in the era where the human has to be the most creative,” Jean said in the video. “There’s one thing that you have over the AI: a soul. And there’s one thing that AI has over you: the infinite information.”\nAI in the music industry\nSome musicians have ardently opposed the use of AI tools in the music-making process, since it’s almost a given that a generative AI tool was trained on copyrighted data from artists without their consent. Hundreds of musicians, including stars like Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, and Jon Bon Jovi, signed an open letter in 2024 calling on tech companies not to undermine human creativity with AI music generation tools.\nA cohort of music publishers also recently sued the AI company Anthropic for $3 billion, claiming that the company illegally downloaded more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, song lyrics, and musical compositions. (Anthropic was already ordered by the court to offer a $1.5 billion settlement to authors whose books were pirated for AI training.)\nOther artists, however, have embraced the potential of this technology as a way to improve audio quality, rather than as a creative aid.\nPaul McCartney used AI-powered noise reduction systems — the kind of technology that allows Zoom or FaceTime to block out unwanted background noises on your video calls — to clean up a decades-old, low-quality John Lennon demo. The resulting “new” Beatles track, “Now and Then,” won a Grammy in 2025.\nMeanwhile, AI music generation tools like Suno have created synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed To Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\nThe law remains unclear on the legality of using copyrighted works as training data — one federal judge, William Alsup, ruled last year that training on copyrighted data is legal, but pirating it is not. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nWhen edtech company Preply became a unicorn earlier this year, employees in its Kyiv office celebrated with cake — because that’s what you do, even in the middle of a war.\nIn the four years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of their country, Ukrainian startups have done more than survive: they are still building and growing. Preply, for instance, will use the proceeds of its latest round to hire some 100 engineers across its global teams — including in Ukraine, where one-third of its engineering staff is based.\nPreply is one example among many. Defense tech has grabbed the most attention, especially for the speed at which innovations reach the battlefield. But the same engineering talent and ingenuity are emerging as a common denominators across sectors that also contribute to strengthening Ukraine.\nWith Ukraine facing a far larger attacker, the country takes a dim view of efforts to escape mobilization. However, startups can be granted special status that shields key employees from the draft if they are deemed to support the country — and Aspichi is one of them, its founder, Victor Samoilenko, told TechCrunch.\nOriginally created in the U.S. in 2021, the company completely pivoted when the war started. It is now best known for Luminify, a mixed-reality platform for mental health care that has been helping Ukrainians cope with wartime trauma. The startup collaborates directly with military units as well as with a dozen clinics that provide mental health support to the population.\nThere are soldiers and veterans, bereaved families, and millions who have moved to western Ukraine or abroad. And for those who have always lived in Kyiv, the psychological toll is no less horrendous. \n“Everybody is suffering,” Samoilenko said. “My daughter celebrated several New Year’s and Christmas underground; so the effect is enormous.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a winter marked by near-daily attacks on the power grid, Ukraine’s capital hasn’t been spared. According to Natali Trubnikova, CMO at Kyiv-based IT consultancy firm Gart Solutions, locals have adapted to power cuts with high-capacity power banks, gasoline stoves, and diesel generators. But rising costs mean they still have to use these sparingly, often keeping indoor temperatures to a strict minimum.\nThese harsh conditions have turned offices into refuges from the cold. \n“Our office has different generators so we have electricity, internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch last month.\nFor smaller startups, coworking spaces have also become havens. LIFT99 Kyiv Hub, a six-year-old venue that suffered damage from a Russian strike last August, has seen its membership numbers surge since its reopening two months ago, its sales and partnership manager Lada Samarska wrote on LinkedIn.\nDespite missile strikes, Kyiv is far enough from the frontline to remain Ukraine’s main startup hub, but it is not the only one. Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, has drawn many displaced Ukrainians — tech workers among them. LEM Station, a renovated tram depot turned creative space, is a symbol of its growing ecosystem, which has also benefited from its proximity to the Polish border.\nForeign visitors have been fewer, but with Lviv still reachable by train, tech conference IT Arena 2025 brought 6,450 participants from more than 40 countries to the city.  Defense tech had its own stage, but the event also showcased support for a wider range of startups. Despite the war, VC firms remain active in the country, including 1991, Flyer One Ventures, and SMRK.\nDespite the long journey, Ukrainians are still making the trip to tech conferences abroad too. At Techarena in Stockholm earlier this month, members of a Ukrainian delegation told TechCrunch they were tired and waiting for the spring. But before saying goodbye, they started listing Ukraine’s unicorns — because that’s what you do, even in the middle of a war.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nPlug-in hybrid vehicles are often touted as a bridge to battery-electric vehicles, promising to slash emissions by operating as EVs for short trips while relying on fossil fuels for longer ones. \nThey only deliver on that promise if they’re regularly charged. Real-world data drawn from the vehicles’ onboard computers shows that’s often not the case.\nUsing that data, the Fraunhofer Institute could determine how much of that energy came from charging when plugged in. It found that less than a third of 1 million PHEVs in Germany plugged in either occasionally or not at all.\nU.S. automakers that are pushing future PHEV models as appealing alternatives for American drivers should take note. By blending gas with electricity, these automakers hope to boost fleet-wide efficiency without a wide rollout of EVs.\n“We’re looking to make CO2 reductions across our lineup, but we’re doing it in a very efficient way,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said this month in an earnings call.\nYet the new study shows that PHEVs seldom deliver on their efficiency promises.\nAt best, Toyota drivers used electricity for 44% of the energy used for driving, suggesting they plugged in the most frequently. The worst? Porsche drivers, at just 0.8%, an average of 7 kilowatt-hours over two years. In other words, the average Porsche PHEV driver charged their battery less than 50% of its capacity — once.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStudies have previously shown that PHEVs produce about 3.5 times more emissions than their official ratings would suggest. This new study explains why since it directly assesses how much electricity the vehicles gained from charging. (PHEVs, like all hybrids, can operate in a mixed mode, using both gas and electricity. The study used data straight off the vehicles to disentangle the two.)\nOne of PHEV’s many shortcomings are their anemic batteries, capable of powering the vehicle for short distances. Some can only traverse a handful of miles, while many sold in recent years can operate on battery power for about 20 to30 miles. Regulators in Europe and automakers have been proposing longer ranges for future models, hoping that a more capable battery will encourage people to charge their batteries more frequently.\nThat’s not guaranteed, though. The vehicles are likely to remain compromised when driving on electrons. That’s because most PHEVs are based on fossil fuel platforms — the electric motors and power electronics aren’t capable of delivering 100% of the vehicle’s power needs. When a driver floors it, the gas engine has to kick in. In other vehicles, the engine turns on in cold weather to heat the cabin. When that happens, “why bother plugging in” is apparently a question most PHEV drivers have asked themselves.\nWhich raises another question: why bother with PHEVs at all?\nPHEVs have been touted as a way to ease cautious consumers into full EVs. The argument goes something like this: Drivers will become habituated with plugging in while EV charging networks are built out. By the time they’re ready for their next vehicle, the networks will be ready and customers can ease into an EV.\nBut if nobody is plugging in their PHEVs, they’re definitely not developing the habit. Without full charges, the electric drivetrain isn’t benefitting anyone. The public still suffer from worse air pollution; and drivers are carting around hundreds of pounds of weight and enduring more recalls and costlier service visits as a result of the complex drivetrain. \nTweaking the PHEV formula to make them more reliant on batteries could help. The interim solution is called an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), and it’s designed to run on battery power until the charge is depleted, at which point the fossil fuel engine recharges it. So far, no EREV has required the owner to plug in — they could easily drive the vehicle for its lifetime on gas. BMW used to make an EREV in the i3, but it stopped production years ago. Ford and Stellantis have both announced EREV pickup trucks, which have yet to go on sale.\nMeanwhile, EV charging networks continue to expand. It’s possible that by the time automakers are making PHEVs and EREVs in large quantities, drivers will no longer need a comfort blanket in the form of a gas engine. (My household came to that conclusion two years ago. After a decade split between a BMW i3 EREV and a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV, we traded up for a Kia EV9.) \nLegacy automakers, which have second guessed their electrification strategies more times than I care to count, could be forced to change tacks once more.\nPHEVs might have been a nifty solution on paper, but they’ve failed to deliver in the real world. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nBelieve it or not, web search is still thriving as an industry. As businesses invest in using AI agents to make the most of their data, there’s demand for tools that not only scrape the web to inform what those AI bots do, but also return those results in a way that’s easier to use with modern data tools.\nThat’s the promise behind web search startup Nimble, which recently raised a $47 million Series B round, led by Norwest. The New York company’s platform employs AI agents to search the web in real time, verify, and validate the results, and then structure the information into neat tables that can then be queried like a database.\nThat last part is crucial here. LLMs and AI agents are great for searching the web, connecting results from a variety of sources, and analyzing them, but they often return the results in plain text, which can be difficult to work with at an enterprise level. And that’s before you factor in hallucinations, the risk of the agent misunderstanding your instructions, or the use of unreliable sources.\nBy validating and structuring results into tables, Nimble lets companies use web data as if it were already part of their existing databases. The startup also integrates with enterprise data warehouses and data lakes — large centralized repositories where businesses store and analyze data — offered by the likes of Databricks and Snowflake. That means its AI agents can plug into a business’s trove of data, using it to build context, and shape how search results are structured and returned.\nIn effect, this lets enterprises have live, structured web data as part of their existing data environments, Nimble CEO and co-founder Uri Knorovich (pictured above, middle) told TechCrunch.\nSuch integrations also allow Nimble’s software to remember constraints — such as how you want the search to be performed, or which data sources to tap. This is particularly useful for applications such as competitor analysis, pricing research, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, brand monitoring, deep research, and financial analysis. (Knorovich noted that Nimble works to ensure all customer data remains within customers’ data infrastructure to comply with data retention and security policies.)\nTo that end, the startup has partnered with Databricks, Snowflake, AWS and Microsoft to help streamline enterprise deployments that require access to internal data sources. (Databricks also participated in this Series B.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Models can do a lot of things, but most production AI fails aren’t because the models are not good enough — it’s because of a data failure,” Knorovich said. “What we’re seeing today is that enterprises don’t need more AI; they need AI with good, reliable web search […] If you nail it down, if you can choose what your agent can search and cannot search, this is the tipping point for enterprises to say, ‘hey we can actually trust AI. We can actually put AI to work in more use cases’.”\nKnorovich says the ability to search the web in real time at scale, and validate and structure search results, is what sets Nimble apart from other data brokers already in the space.\nThe startup currently has more than 100 customers, with the majority of its revenue coming from large enterprises, Fortune 500 companies, and even some Fortune 10 companies, including major retailers, hedge funds, banks, and consumer packaged goods companies, as well as some AI-native startups.\n“Nimble is tackling a problem that has existed for years without a proper solution and is now becoming of critical urgency,” Assaf Harel, partner at Norwest, said in a statement. “Trusted live web data is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for AI agents performing critical business decisions.”\nThe Series B also saw participation from returning investors Target Global, Square Peg, Hetz Ventures, Slow Ventures, R-Squared Ventures, J-Ventures, and InvestInData. Proceeds from the round will be used to expand R&D in multi-agent web search and a governed data layer that processes and validates search results. \nNimble has now raised a total of $75 million.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nThe now-viral X post from Meta AI security researcher Summer Yue reads, at first, like satire. She told her OpenClaw AI agent to check her overstuffed email inbox and suggest what to delete or archive.  \nThe agent proceeded to run amok. It started deleting all her email in a “speed run” while ignoring her commands from her phone telling it to stop. \n“I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb,” she wrote, posting images of the ignored stop prompts as receipts.  \nThe Mac Mini, an affordable Apple computer that sits flat on a desk and fits in the palm of your hand, has become the favored device these days for running OpenClaw. (The Mini is selling “like hotcakes,” one “confused” Apple employee apparently told famed AI researcher Andrej Karpathy when he bought one to run an OpenClaw alternative called NanoClaw.) \nOpenClaw is, of course, the open source AI agent that achieved fame through Moltbook, an AI-only social network. OpenClaw agents were at the center of that now largely debunked episode on Moltbook in which it looked like the AIs were plotting against humans.  \nBut OpenClaw’s mission, according to its GitHub page, is not focused on social networks. It aims to be a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices.  \nThe Silicon Valley in-crowd has fallen so in love with OpenClaw that “claw” and “claws” have become the buzzwords of choice for agents that run on personal hardware. Other such agents include ZeroClaw, IronClaw, and PicoClaw. Y Combinator’s podcast team even appeared on their most recent episode dressed in lobster costumes. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Yue’s post serves as a warning. As others on X noted, if an AI security researcher could run into this problem, what hope do mere mortals have? \n“Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?” a software developer asked her on X.  \n“Rookie mistake tbh,” she replied. She had been testing her agent with a smaller “toy” inbox, as she called it, and it had been running well on less important email. It had earned her trust, so she thought she’d let it loose on the real thing. \nYue believes that the large amount of data in her real inbox “triggered compaction,” she wrote. Compaction happens when the context window — the running record of everything the AI has been told and has done in a session — grows too large, causing the agent to begin summarizing, compressing, and managing the conversation.  \nAt that point, the AI may skip over instructions that the human considers quite important.  \nIn this case, it may have skipped her last prompt — where she told it not to act — and reverted back to its instructions from the “toy” inbox. \nAs several others on X pointed out, prompts can’t be trusted to act as security guardrails. Models may misconstrue or ignore them. \nVarious people offered suggestions that ranged from the exact syntax Yue should have used to stop the agent, to various methods to ensure better adherence to guardrails, like writing instructions to dedicated files or using other open source tools. \nIn the interest of full transparency, TechCrunch could not independently verify what happened to Yue’s inbox. (She didn’t respond to our request for comment, though she did respond to many questions and comments sent her way on X.) \nBut it doesn’t really matter. \nThe point of the tale is that agents aimed at knowledge workers, at their current stage of development, are risky. People who say they are using them successfully are cobbling together methods to protect themselves.\nOne day, perhaps soon (by 2027? 2028?), they may be ready for widespread use. Goodness knows many of us would love help with email, grocery orders, and scheduling dentist appointments. But that day has not yet come. \n"

    "body": "\nAnthropic is accusing three Chinese AI companies of setting up more than 24,000 fake accounts with its Claude AI model to improve their own models.\nThe labs — DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax — allegedly generated more than 16 million exchanges with Claude through those accounts using a technique called “distillation.” Anthropic said the labs “targeted Claude’s most differentiated capabilities: agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding.”\nThe accusations come amid debates over how strictly to enforce export controls on advanced AI chips, a policy aimed at curbing China’s AI development. \nDistillation is a common training method that AI labs use on their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions, but competitors can use it to essentially copy the homework of other labs. OpenAI sent a memo to House lawmakers earlier this month accusing DeepSeek of using distillation to mimic its products. \nDeepSeek first made waves a year ago when it released its open source R1 reasoning model that nearly matched American frontier labs in performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is expected to soon release DeepSeek V4, its latest model, which reportedly can outperform Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in coding.\nThe scale of each attack differed in scope. Anthropic tracked more than 150,000 exchanges from DeepSeek that seemed aimed at improving foundational logic and alignment, specifically around censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries. \nMoonshot AI had more than 3.4 million exchanges targeting agentic reasoning and tool use, coding and data analysis, computer-use agent development, and computer vision. Last month, the firm released a new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMiniMax’s 13 million exchanges targeted agentic coding and tool use and orchestration. Anthropic said it was able to observe MiniMax in action as it redirected nearly half its traffic to siphon capabilities from the latest Claude model when it was launched. \nAnthropic says it will continue to invest in defenses that make distillation attacks harder to execute and easier to identify, but is calling on “a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers.”  \nThe distillation attacks come at a time when American chip exports to China are still hotly debated. Last month, the Trump administration formally allowed U.S. companies like Nvidia to export advanced AI chips (like the H200) to China. Critics have argued that this loosening of export controls increases China’s AI computing capacity at a critical time in the global race for AI dominance.\nAnthropic says that the scale of extraction DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot performed “requires access to advanced chips.”\n“Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,” per Anthropic’s blog. \nDmitri Alperovitch, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think-tank and co-founder and former CTO of CrowdStrike, told TechCrunch he’s not surprised to see these attacks.\n“It’s been clear for a while now that part of the reason for the rapid progress of Chinese AI models has been theft via distillation of U.S. frontier models. Now we know this for a fact,” Alperovitch said. “This should give us even more compelling reasons to refuse to sell any AI chips to any of these [companies], which would only advantage them further.”\nAnthropic also said distillation doesn’t only threaten to undercut American AI dominance, but could also create national security risks.\n“Anthropic and other U.S. companies build systems that prevent state and non-state actors from using AI to, for example, develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities,” reads Anthropic’s blog post. “Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely.”\nAnthropic pointed to authoritarian governments deploying frontier AI for things like “offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance,” a risk that is multiplied if those models are open sourced.\nTechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot for comment. \nThis article has been updated to clarify Dmitri Alperovitch was formerly CTO of Crowdstrike. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

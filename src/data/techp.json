It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Enterprise\n\n"

Recent examples include Stripe, which this week said it would allow employees to sell shares at a $159 billion valuation, as well as Clay, ElevenLabs, and Linear.\nBeyond retention and to help staff cover tax bills triggered when RSUs vest, they relieve pressure on management to pursue an IPO before the company is ready.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n"

Now AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.\nOn Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture announced a multiyear partnership. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced deals with Accenture as well.\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its “Frontier Alliance” initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new OpenAI Frontier AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with IBM and Deloitte.\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says. \nThe new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts. \nThe move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.\nSince then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently-launched “Page Match” tool, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.\nSpotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.\n“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s Director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in a blog post. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”\nIt’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWeeks after stepping down as CEO from food delivery service Zomato and its parent Eternal, Indian entrepreneur Deepinder Goyal is back with a $54 million raise for wearable startup Temple, part of what the 43-year-old earlier described as a shift toward “higher-risk exploration and experimentation.”\nOn Friday, Goyal said in a post on X that Temple had raised funds in a friends-and-family round from founder friends and early Zomato backers, at a post-money valuation of about $190 million. More than 30 employees participated at the same valuation, he said.\nGoyal is leading the funding round, followed by Steadview Capital, according to regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch. Other investors include Peak XV Partners, Info Edge Ventures, and Dharana Capital, alongside angel investors such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm, Kunal Shah of CRED, Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath of Zerodha, as well as current and former Eternal executives including Akshant Goyal, Aditya Mangla, Kunal Swarup, Akriti Chopra, and Rahul Ganjoo.\nGoyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, handing the role to Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.\nTemple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.\nDuring a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal described Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.\nIn a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple aims to build what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain–computer interface engineering.\n\nWe're recruiting at @temple.At Temple, we are building the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes. A device that measures what no other wearable in the world measures, with a level of precision that doesn't exist yet.To build it, we need people who are obsessive… pic.twitter.com/iCHaMUwdEw— Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal) February 27, 2026\n\nThe startup is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded wearables market, where companies such as Whoop, Oura, and Garmin have spent years refining devices that track sleep, recovery, and athletic performance. Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.\nThe push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had committed $25 million of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.\nGoyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.\nChaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the purchase of Uber Eats’ India business in 2020 and grocery delivery platform Blinkit — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.\nBefore Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including Ultrahuman, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.\nGoyal declined to comment further on Temple.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Users who are part of the test can type “DM me” or “Message me” in a post or reply to automatically generate a hyperlink that invites others to start a private conversation with them.\nTapping on the shortcut will take you to a one-on-one direct messaging chat with the person. If you both follow each other, the message will go directly to their primary inbox. If you don’t follow each other, the message is filtered through the “Message Requests” folder to prevent spam. \nThe company says the new shortcut removes the need to navigate to a person’s profile to start a DM conversation with them. \nWhile Threads was late to introduce a native DM feature, this latest move indicates that the social network is looking to make messaging a more central part of its platform, as it’s working to reduce the number of steps it takes to start a conversation. \nImage Credits:Threads\nThe new feature is rolling out to select users in the U.S. and Canada. As with any other test feature, it’s unknown when or if Threads plans to roll out the feature more widely. \nThe DM shortcut is just one of several new features that have rolled out on Threads in recent months. The social network recently introduced an AI-powered feature that lets users personalize their feed, and the ability to share posts directly to an Instagram Story without leaving the app. Plus, Threads was spotted exploring in-message games last month.\nThe additions come as a recent report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggested that Threads now surpasses X in daily mobile usage.

    "body": "\nMeeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.\nThe company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\n\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Read AI\nThe company said that while Ada currently works via email, it will soon be available on Slack and Teams.\nOn the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Shim told TechCrunch that the company now has over 5 million monthly active users and plans to grow that number to 10 million. He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally. \nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data. Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has raised $110 billion in private funding, the company announced Friday morning, commencing one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.\nNotably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.\n“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”\nAs part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.\nThe company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it was the largest private funding round on record.\nAs part of its Amazon partnership, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on Amazon’s Bedrock platform. The company will also expand its previously announced AWS partnership, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Tranium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.\n“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Information had previously reported that $35 billion of Amazon’s investment could be contingent on the company either achieving AGI or making its IPO by the end of the year. OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”\nOpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.\nNvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed. \nIn January, Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money.

    "body": "\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said Thursday that he “cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon’s] request” to give the military unrestricted access to its AI systems.\n“Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” Amodei wrote in a statement. “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nThis isn’t about Anthropic or the specific conditions at issue. It’s about the broader premise that technology deeply embedded in our military must be under the exclusive control of our duly elected/appointed leaders. No private company can dictate normative terms of use—which… https://t.co/VHbtzWujDA— Senior Official Jeremy Lewin (@UnderSecretaryF) February 27, 2026\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. An Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch Amodei’s statement does not mean the firm is walking away from negotiations and is continuing to engage in good faith with the Department going forward. \n“The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress on preventing Claude’s use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,” an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. “New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW’s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.”\nThe Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job. \n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei said. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\nTLDR, he’s saying: “We can just part ways. There’s no need to be nasty about it.”\nThis article has been updated with a statement from an Anthropic spokesperson. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nCould Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn a flurry of deal offers in the high tens of billions of dollars, the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is over. David Ellison-owned Paramount will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nParamount will take on the about $33 billion in debt held by Warner Bros. Discovery, according to the deal. Larry Ellison, whose net worth is $201 billion, according to Bloomberg, has agreed to supply the additional equity to fulfill Paramount’s bid. Paramount’s market cap is about $12 billion.\nThe deal is also being financed by a $57.5 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management.\nNetflix shares jumped as much as 10% in after-hours trading in New York. Shares in Paramount were up 4.5%.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGraham Starr is the deputy editor of TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade. Hours after IDC published its report, another analyst firm, Counterpoint, made a similar prediction and said the market will dip by 12% this year.\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\nImage Credits:IDC\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIDC added that it expects RAM prices to stabilize by mid-2027.\nCounterpoint said that premium smartphones would be more resilient to this change, but the sub-$200 smartphone segment will see a 20% dip. \n“The impact is expected to continue through H2 2027, as it will take several quarters for memory supply expansion to materialize. Lower-end smartphones are likely to be affected the most, especially as LPDDR4 supply is shrinking faster than expected. OEMs are already responding with launch delays, streamlined portfolios, and specification trade-offs. We have also observed 10% to 20% price increases across some Android OEM portfolios in January 2026,” Principal Analyst Yang Wang said.\nImage Credits: Counterpoint\nThe firm also predicted that pricing volatility amid handsets will also drive the second-hand devices market up. \nEarlier this year, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei also warned that smartphones will cost more in 2026 as memory costs for smartphones rise. “Brands now face a simple choice: raise prices by 30% or more in some cases, or downgrade specs. The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs for severance, Dorsey told U.S. employees who are being cut that they will receive “your salary for 20 weeks + 1 week per year of tenure, equity vested through the end of [M]ay, 6 months of health care, your corporate devices, and $5,000 to put toward whatever you need to help you in this transition.” Employees outside the U.S. will receive “similar support” dependent on their countries’ policies, he added.\nSalesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of other companies that have made enormous staffing cuts citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month cast some doubt on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023.

    "body": "\nAs space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTim Fernholz is a journalist who writes about technology, finance and public policy.

    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n1:26 PM PST · February 4, 2026\n\nImage Credits:Prime Video\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nLast summer, Amazon MGM Studios launched a dedicated AI Studio to develop proprietary AI tools to streamline TV and film production, with a focus on areas like improving character consistency across shots and supporting pre- and post-production.\nAccording to a report from Reuters, those tools are now ready to move beyond internal testing. Amazon will begin a closed beta program in March, inviting industry partners to try out its AI tools.\nAmazon said it anticipates sharing initial outcomes from the program by May. The company chose not to provide further details on the developments when approached by TechCrunch for a comment.\nThe AI Studio is collaborating with notable producers like Robert Stromberg, known for “Maleficent,” Kunal Nayyar from “The Big Bang Theory,” and former animator Colin Brady from Pixar to learn the best way to implement these tools. Amazon is also tapping Amazon Web Services for support and intends to work with several LLM providers.\nAlbert Cheng, who heads the AI Studios initiative, emphasized that the goal is to support creative teams, not to replace them. The focus is on improving efficiency and reducing costs while ensuring that intellectual property is protected and AI-generated content isn’t absorbed into other AI models. One example used is Amazon’s “House of David” series, which featured 350 AI-generated shots in season two. \n​However, the rise of adoption of AI in Hollywood has stirred up plenty of debate. Many people in the industry worry about what it means for jobs, creativity, and the future of filmmaking. \nThe conversations around AI are only getting louder as more companies experiment with these new tools. For instance, Netflix has also jumped on the AI bandwagon, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealing that its series “The Eternaut” used generative AI to create a building collapse scene.\nIn recent years, Amazon has cited its success with AI as a factor in layoffs. The company recently eliminated 16,000 jobs in January, following 14,000 layoffs last October.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

The company on Wednesday said it now has 325 million paying users across Google One and YouTube Premium, up from 300 million three months earlier.\nYouTube reported ad revenue increased 9% to $11.38 billion in the fourth quarter, but missed analysts’ average estimates of $11.84 billion. YouTube’s overall revenue, including ads and subscriptions, came in at $60 billion in the full financial year, up 17% compared to a year earlier.\nThe company said that YouTube’s $8 per month, ad-free premium tier is seeing strong traction, but didn’t specify any numbers. It added that YouTube Premium also saw strong growth.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company plans to flesh out its subscription offerings, especially to capitalize on its growing YouTube TV userbase. “We’ll soon launch new YouTube TV plans, bringing more choice and flexibility to subscribers with over 10 genre-specific packages,” he said. \nYouTube Shorts recorded 200 billion average daily views in the quarter, the same as last year, but in some countries, ads on short-form video earn more than in-stream ads on a per-hour basis, the company said. Pichai also highlighted podcasts as a growing format, with viewers watching 700 million hours of podcasts from their TVs in October.\nYouTube said that its AI features are seeing traction, and more than 1 million channels are using its AI creation tools. The company said that 20 million consumers used its Gemini-powered content discovery tool in December.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

    "body": "\nSnap is on a mission to diversify its revenue sources — moving from a business model in which it largely chases ad revenue to one where it can also make money through subscriptions and, eventually, hardware. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.\nIn Q4, Snap’s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.\nThe company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform launched back in 2022. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.\nWhile those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.\nReuters also reports that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.\nDuring Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to charge users for Memories storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.\n“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nAlphabet declined to answer one of its investors during questions about Google’s AI deal with Apple on Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings call. Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.\nThat decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI. \nOver the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker $20 billion to be the default search engine on Apple devices, filings from the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple’s massive customer base — the iPhone maker last quarter announced it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.\nThe latest Apple AI deal is rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn’t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers’ websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google’s search business, are still an “experiment” for now.\nThe company first announced last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads’ placement below or integrated into the chatbot’s responses. Google is also trying out agentic shopping, including Shop with AI Mode, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface. \nMeanwhile, Google’s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with its forthcoming Super Bowl ad, which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.\nHow this will all play out longer-term is still an open question — and for today, an unanswered one, apparently. \nOverall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet’s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple’s “preferred cloud provider” and would be helping to develop “the next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.” Google’s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle’s AI chatbot Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings. This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.\nLast quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has reported nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.\nThe recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance. \nCEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.\nGoogle recently rolled out a more affordable plan, the Google AI Plus, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.\n“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors. \nGemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called Ironwood, to compete with Nvidia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,” Pichai stated in today’s release.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Tetra Images / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2:27 PM PST · February 4, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe Internet Archive is a nonprofit that — as you might expect — is devoted to archiving the internet and preserving digital context for future generations. This week, the platform announced a new tool designed to expand on that mission by helping the world’s WordPress users keep their articles in peak digital health.\nThe Archive’s Wayback Machine, which indexes the web through widespread snapshotting, has partnered with Automattic, the company behind WordPress. Together, the two organizations have launched a new WordPress plug-in — the Link Fixer — that is designed to combat the scourge of “link rot.”\n“Link rot” is the unfortunate phenomenon whereby online articles become populated by broken links — URLs that once led to active pages but now result in error messages or dead ends. A Pew Research study from 2024 showed that nearly 40% of links that existed in 2013 were no longer active. Such “digital decay” occurs across a broad diversity of web pages, from news and government sites to Wikipedia pages to tweets.\nAutomattic says that its new plug-in works by scanning your WordPress posts for outbound links, then cross-referencing the Wayback Machine for archived versions of those links. If there are none, it will automatically take new snapshots of the articles in question. Should a linked web page go offline, the new feature will then redirect readers to the archived versions, so that there is no drop in service. The tool also archives a user’s own posts, helping to ensure their longevity.\nThe tool is designed to keep a site’s visitors reading the best available version of a web page. Indeed, Automattic’s plug-in perpetually checks a web page’s links, and if an original link that had gone offline is resurrected, the plug-in will start redirecting the user to that original page again instead of the archived version.\nA write-up on Github shows that the plug-in’s controls are relatively easy to maneuver and offer convenient customization. For instance, users can specify how often they want the plug-in to scan a link for validity (the default offered by the program is every three days).\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nVoice AI company ElevenLabs said today it raised $500 million in a new funding round led by Sequoia Capital, which was an investor in the startup’s last secondary round through a tender. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board.\nThe startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in its last round in January 2025. Earlier in the year, the Financial Times reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation.\nThe company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it. Some prior investors, like BroadLight, NFDG, Valor Capital, AMP Coalition, and Smash Capital, also joined the round. New investors for the funding included Lightspeed Venture Partners, EvanticCapital, and Bond.\nElevenLabs said that it will disclose some investors later in February, which might be strategic partners. The company has raised over $781 million to date. It said that it will use the funding for research and product development, along with expansion in international markets like India, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and Mexico. \nThe company’s co-founder, Mati Staniszewski, indicated that ElevenLabs might work on agents beyond voice and incorporate video. In January, the company announced a partnership with LTX to produce audio-to-video content.\n“The intersection of models and products is critical – and our team has proven, time and again, how to translate research into real-world experiences. This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether. We plan to expand our Creative offering – helping creators combine our best-in-class audio with video and Agents – enabling businesses to build agents that can talk, type, and take action,” he said in a statement.\nThe company has seen good growth momentum as it closed the year at $330 million ARR. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, Staniszewski said that it took ElevenLabs five months to reach $200 million to $300 million in ARR.\nVoice AI model providers are an attractive target for investors and big tech companies. In January, rival Deepgram raised $130 million from AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.

    "body": "\nAnthropic’s Super Bowl commercial, one of four ads the AI lab dropped on Wednesday, begins with the word “BETRAYAL” splashed boldly across the screen. The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.\nThe bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.\nAnother commercial features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.\nThe Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s recent announcement that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic “mocks,” “skewers,” and “dunks on” OpenAI.\nThey are funny enough that even Sam Altman admitted on X that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”\n\nFirst, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…— Sam Altman (@sama) February 4, 2026\n\nIn that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin.\nBut the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on its blog, “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”\nAltman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”\nBut Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, and $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, and $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.\nAltman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like,” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.\nTrue, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been “responsible AI.” The company was founded by two former OpenAI alums, after all, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.\nStill, both chatbot companies have usage policies, AI guardrails, and talk about AI safety. And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to be used for erotica while Anthropic does not, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that some content should be blocked, particularly in regards to mental health.\nYet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”\n“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.\nUsing “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which protesters around the world have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.\n\n\n\n"

    "body": "\nWhile Spotify users face yet another price hike, book lovers have some exciting developments to look forward to that could help cushion the blow.\nSpotify announced several updates for its audiobook business on Thursday, notably its expansion into physical books. Users in the U.S. and the UK will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app, marking a significant pivot for the once digital-only platform. \nThe company also introduced two features designed to make the audiobook experience smoother and more flexible, including a new tool called “Page Match” that lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook. \nAdditionally, “Audiobook Recaps”—a previously iOS-only feature—is coming to Android devices in the spring. This feature provides bite-sized recaps tailored to the last section users stopped listening to.\nImage Credits:Spotify\n​Spotify’s decision to sell physical books through its app positions it as a competitor to major booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. \nSpotify has partnered with Bookshop.org on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities.\nThe ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop’s website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Spotify\nTo bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by Android Authority last month. \nSpotify’s new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It’s powered by a combination of Spotify’s in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.\nWhen users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they’re reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.\nPage Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.\nIn the two years since Spotify first introduced audiobooks, the platform has experienced significant growth. The company reported in October that the number of users listening to audiobooks rose 36% over the past year, and listening hours increased 37%. Plus, more than half of Spotify’s 281 million premium subscribers have engaged with an audiobook.\nSpotify is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results February 10.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nForget EVs — stationary batteries are getting all the buzz, and investment, in the U.S. these days.\nStartup Lunar Energy is the latest example. The six-year-old company, which builds battery packs for homeowners in California, Georgia, and Washington, said Wednesday it has completed two large funding rounds. The startup shared it raised a previously unannounced $130 million Series C and a $102 million Series D. The Series C was led by Activate Capital, while the Series D was led by B Capital and Prelude Ventures.\nThe startup plans to use the funds to scale manufacturing to 20,000 units by the end of this year before ramping up to 100,000 by the end of 2028. In total, Lunar has raised more than $500 million from investors.\nStationary storage has become a bright spot for battery manufacturers that have been subject to policy whiplash after the Trump administration and GOP-controlled Congress gutted large parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, which had incentivized companies to build batteries in the U.S. to supply the automotive industry.\nAs the grid strains under the weight of an increasingly electrified economy — along with the boom in data center demand — grid-connected batteries have become one of the most versatile ways to boost its resiliency. \nLunar can call on its fleet of batteries, which come in 5 kilowatt-hour modules between 15 kilowatt-hours and 30 kilowatt-hours, to deliver juice to the grid when needed. Its virtual power plant (VPP) software can also control EV chargers and appliances, allowing it to both supply electrons while tamping down demand.\nSuch VPPs are expected to be able to replace costly and polluting peaking power plants in a matter of years.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCompetition in the space has been heating up lately. In October, Base Power raised $1 billion, less than six months after raising a $200 million round for its residential battery-based VPP. Tesla operates its own Powerwall-based VPP, too. \nOutside of residential settings, Tesla’s storage business has been growing in leaps and bounds, while former Tesla executive JB Straubel’s startup Redwood Materials has launched its own energy storage division. Even Ford wants in on the action. \nBatteries have transformed from bit players just five years ago to major assets on the grid. Their modularity makes them quick to build and easy to deploy, and while they’re still costly relative to some fossil fuel power sources, prices have been dropping quickly. No wonder investors are piling in.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLast year, Roblox launched an open source AI model that could generate 3D objects on the platform, helping users quickly design digital items such as furniture, vehicles, and accessories. The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March.\nOn Wednesday, the company launched the open beta for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in early access since November. \nRoblox says 4D creation adds an important new layer: interactivity. With this technology, users can design items that can move and react to players in the game.\nImage Credits:Roblox\n​At launch, there are two types of object templates (called schemas) that creators can try out. \nThe first is the “Car-5” schema, which is used to create a car made of five separate parts: the main body and four wheels. Previously, cars were a single, solid 3D object that couldn’t move. The new system breaks down objects into parts and assigns behaviors to each so that they function individually within the virtual world. The AI therefore can generate cars with spinning wheels, making them more realistic and interactive. ​\nThe second is called “Body-1,” which can generate any object made from a single piece, like a simple box or sculpture.\nThe first experience with 4D generation is a game called Wish Master, where players can generate cars they can drive, planes they can fly, and even dragons.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​In the future, Roblox plans to let creators make their own schemas so they’ll have more freedom to define how objects behave. The company says it is also developing new technology that could use a reference image to create a detailed 3D model that matches the image’s style (example below).\nImage Credits:Roblox\nThe company says it is developing more ways to help people create games and experiences using AI, including a project it has dubbed “real-time dreaming.” Roblox CEO David Baszucki last month explained that this project would let creators build new worlds using “keyboard navigation and sharing real-time text prompts.”\nThe open beta comes on the heels of Roblox’s recent implementation of mandatory facial verification for users to access chat features in the game, following lawsuits and investigations related to child safety.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nAdobe is putting on hold its plan to discontinue Adobe Animate following intense backlash from its customers after it announced plans to shut down the 2D animation software amid an increased focus on its investments in AI.\n“We are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content,” the company wrote in a post on Wednesday.\nAdobe’s Monday announcement about discontinuing Animate was met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger, and users aired concerns about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.\nThe company changed its tune on Wednesday, saying there would no longer be a “deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.”\n“Adobe Animate is in maintenance mode for all customers. This applies to individual, small business, and enterprise customers.  Maintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users - we will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,” it said.\nOne customer, posting on X, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like, “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and, “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.”\nOn Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year.\nAdobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an FAQ, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”\n\n\n\n\nReading between the lines, it seemed as if Adobe was saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.\nWhat’s surprising is that Adobe couldn’t even recommend software that would fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”\nFor instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.\nThere were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.\nBefore switching to “maintenance mode,” Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.\nSome users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.\nUpdated, February 4, 2026, to note that Adobe reversed its decision and announced the software would be placed in maintenance mode instead of discontinued. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nStarbase, the company town that Elon Musk’s SpaceX created in South Texas, is forming its own police squad.\nThe city’s commission approved an ordinance during a special meeting Tuesday that would create a municipal police department, subject to approval from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). The department will be run by a chief of police elected by the city’s commission, and is expected to hire eight officers, according to local news outlet Valley Central. It could be up and running in a few months.\n“There is a lot of assets here with the operations of SpaceX,” Starbase city administrator Kent Myers told the outlet. “Those assets need to be protected, and so the police department will play a critical part in protecting those assets.”\nIt’s not clear if Starbase has submitted its application to the TCOLE yet. The city and the TCOLE did not respond to requests for comment. Starbase reportedly hired security consulting firm Vision Quest Solutions to build out the department.\nStarbase is where SpaceX makes and tests its prototype Starship rocket. The city is small — it is currently home to just a few hundred residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees (or family of those workers). But it is geographically isolated. The closest neighboring town is Brownsville, which is about 10 miles away, though the drive can take 45 minutes or longer.\nA police department would be the latest addition to public services that have become available in Starbase since it was incorporated as a city last year. In October, a handful of SpaceX employees who live at Starbase started a volunteer fire department. The city also created a fire marshal position and took on its own building inspections and permitting around that same time.\nStarbase initially tried to handle law enforcement within its city limits by contracting with the Cameron County sheriff’s office. The city struck a $3.5 million, five-year contract with the sheriff’s office that was supposed to see two deputies patrol the city at a time, with eight deputies overall assigned to the detail. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStarbase also struck an agreement last year with the sheriff’s office to use the county’s jail. The company town agreed to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse any additional expenses, like medical care.\nThe deal apparently has not worked out, though.\n“We didn’t have a lot of success in finding deputies through the county, so we decided to change direction,” Myers told Valley Central. That was apparently due in part to the contract not having civil service protections, Sheriff Manuel Treviño told the outlet.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a press release. Taiwan currently produces more than half of the world’s semiconductors.\nTaiwan will also supply an additional $250 billion in credit guarantees for additional investments from these semiconductors and tech enterprises, according to the commerce department. The time period of these investments is unclear.\nIn return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal.\nThe news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside.\n“This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.”\nThe proclamation, which announced 25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

A relatively unknown startup, Symbolic.ai, wants to change that, and it just signed a major deal with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch. \nNews Corp, the major assets of which include MarketWatch, the New York Post, and the WSJ, is set to begin using Symbolic’s AI platform with its financial news hub Dow Jones Newswires. \nSymbolic.ai, which was founded by former eBay CEO Devin Wenig and Ars Technica co-founder Jon Stokes, says its AI platform can “assist in the production of quality journalism and content” and that its tool has even led to “productivity gains of as much as 90% for complex research tasks.” The platform is designed to make editorial workflows more efficient, providing improvements in areas like newsletter creation, audio transcription, fact-checking, “headline optimization,” SEO advice, and others.   \nIn general, News Corp has shown a willingness to integrate AI into its media operations. In 2024, the company signed a multi-year partnership with OpenAI, wherein it would license its material to the AI company. Last November, the media conglomerate signaled that it was considering branching out, and licensing its material to other AI companies. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "body": "\nThrough an extension to its previous $50 million Series A round that closed in September, AI video generation startup Higgsfield has sold another $80 million worth of stock, bringing its total Series A to $130 million. The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation.\nHiggsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his previous startup, AI Factory, in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory.\nFive months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says.\nThe startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its press release.\nTo position itself less as an AI slop maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.”\nOf course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.)\nOn the other hand, its users also share plenty of projects centered on fashion and Hollywood-esque story telling, as well.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestors in the Series A extension include Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures.\n"

Notably, the policy does not stop businesses from providing customer service via bots within WhatsApp to their customers.\nIn its notice, Brazil’s competition agency said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta has previously provided a similar exemption to users in Italy after the country’s competition agency took issue with the policy in December. Separately, the EU has also opened an antitrust investigation into the new rules.\nThe company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.\n“These claims are fundamentally flawed,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in response to CADE’s probe on Tuesday. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform.” \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFormer OpenAI exec Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, is saying goodbye to two of its co-founders, both of whom are headed back to OpenAI. Another former OpenAI staffer who went to work for Murati’s startup is also headed back to the company.\nOn social media on Wednesday, Murati announced the departure of Barret Zoph, the company’s co-founder and CTO. “We have parted ways with Barret Zoph,” Murati said in a post on X. “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility.”\nMurati’s announcement made no mention of other departures.\nJust 58 minutes after Murati’s announcement of Zoph’s departure, Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, announced that Zoph would be headed back to OpenAI. “Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team,” Simo wrote on X.\nMetz is another co-founder of Thinking Machines and previously worked for OpenAI for a number of years on the company’s technical staff. So did Schoenholz, whose LinkedIn profile still lists him as working for Thinking Machines.\nZoph previously worked for OpenAI as VP of research, and before that, worked for six years at Google as a research scientist. Murati, who served as the CTO of OpenAI until September 2024, left the company and co-founded Thinking Machines with Zoph and Metz. The startup, where Murati serves as CEO, has amassed significant financial support since then, closing a $2 billion seed round last July, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, as well as Accel, Nvidia, AMD, and Jane Street, among others. The round valued the company at $12 billion.\nTechCrunch has reached out to both Thinking Machines and OpenAI for comment. Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs wasn’t amicable. Certainly, it’s telling that Murati didn’t write more in her public messaging about his departure from the company.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile talent moves between AI giants are common in Silicon Valley, the departure of co-founders from a startup less than a year after its founding is particularly notable. The loss of two co-founders simultaneously — especially when one served as CTO — could be perceived as a particularly meaningful setback for Thinking Machines, which had assembled a high-profile team of former OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI researchers.\nThe company has also lost other key personnel, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who left to join Meta in October. OpenAI itself has seen numerous co-founders depart to launch or join competing ventures, including John Schulman, who left for Anthropic in August 2024 before joining Thinking Machines as chief scientist at its launch in February of last year.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nAfter months of rumors that the Trump administration was going to impose tariffs on semiconductors, a tariff has been announced for some chips. The tariff only applies to certain semiconductors, including the Nvidia H200 advanced AI chips set to ship to China.\nPresident Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries.\nThis news formalizes a key component of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to give Nvidia the green light to start shipping its H200 advanced AI chips to vetted customers in China in December. It also includes chips from other companies, including the AMD MI325X.\nIn spite of the tariffs, Nvidia publicly cheered the move, which allows it to sell the chip to approved customers.\n“We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch.\nThere is demand for these H200 semiconductors. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies.\nDemand is just one factor, though. The other is how the Chinese government decides to regulate these imports.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChina finds itself in a similar, yet different situation to the U.S. when it comes to chip production and the global AI race. China wants to boost its domestic semiconductor industry, but the country also doesn’t want to fall behind while it waits for its domestic tech to catch up to international rivals.\nThe Chinese central government is working to draft rules and guidelines of how many semiconductors Chinese companies can purchase from overseas, according to reporting from Nikkei Asia. This would allow for some purchasing of Nvidia’s chips and would be a reversal from the country’s current adversity toward the chip imports.\nWednesday’s executive order does not apply to chips that are imported into the U.S. and then used in the country for research, defense, or commercial purposes.\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10% of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains. This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nBerlin-based Parloa has raised $350 million in Series D funding from existing investors, valuing the six-year-old customer service AI startup at $3 billion. The round comes just eight months after the company raised $120 million at a $1 billion valuation.\nThe new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from returning backers, including EQT Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Durable Capital, and Mosaic Ventures.\nParloa is one of many startups developing AI agents that promise to automate the kind of customer service work previously handled by human representatives and help desk staff.\nThe company’s competitors include Sierra, co-founded by OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor, which raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation in September; and Decagon, reportedly in talks to raise capital at a valuation of upward of $4 billion. Other companies working to replace human agents with AI include older players Intercom and Kore.ai, as well as the U.K.-based PolyAI, which raised an $86 million round at a $750 million valuation last month.\nMalte Kosub, Parloa’s co-founder and CEO, doesn’t seem fazed by the competition, largely because he doesn’t believe this is a “winner-take-all” category. “In the end, it is one of the biggest opportunities that has ever existed in software,” he told TechCrunch.  \nIndeed, Parloa and its rivals are vying to automate a significant portion of the global customer support workforce, which Gartner estimates at 17 million contact center agents worldwide.\nBut it’s not just the size of the market that gives Kosub confidence about Parloa’s ability to win. He pointed to the startup’s massive fundraise as a sign that it could be among the top leaders in the space. “There are a lot of companies out there, but you need to look at the scale and the amount of funding they got,” he said. “The number of competitors is decreasing significantly.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast month, Parloa said that it was generating annual recurring revenue of more than $50 million, but that’s not meaningfully ahead of Poly AI, which expected to end 2025 with ARR of $40 million, or Decagon, which is reportedly making “significantly more” than $30 million in ARR. Still, Kosub seems convinced that being so well capitalized will help his startup get ahead.\nParloa’s AI agents are already answering calls for large enterprise customers, which include Allianz, Booking.com, HealthEquity, SAP, Sedgwick, and Swiss Life, but the CEO says the goal is to do more than just build software that “picks up the phone.”\nThe company will invest a significant portion of its new capital into building a “multi-model, contextual experience” that will allow personalized AI agents to recognize a customer’s identity and specific needs, whether they reach out via an app, a website, or a phone call.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.\nIn addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.\nThese deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. \nThe foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top 10 most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.\n“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” \nIn addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 p.m. UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels.\nThe organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAs of Thursday, 92 million Iranians have been completely blocked from accessing the internet for more than a week, in what is now one of the longest nationwide internet shutdowns ever, according to experts.\nLast Thursday, Iran’s leadership blocked internet and phone access across the whole country in response to massive anti-government protests, which began at the end of last year and have prompted a brutal and deadly crackdown from authorities. \nAs of this writing, Iranians have not been able to access the internet for more than 170 hours. The previous longest shutdowns in the country lasted around 163 hours in 2019, and 160 hours in 2025, according to Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a web monitoring company that tracks internet disruptions. \nMater said that the current shutdown in Iran is the third longest on record, after the internet shutdown in Sudan in mid-2021 that lasted around 35 days, followed by the outage in Mauritania in July 2024, which lasted 22 days. \n“Iran’s shutdowns remain among the most comprehensive and tightly enforced nationwide blackouts we’ve observed, particularly in terms of population affected,” Mater told TechCrunch. \nThe exact ranking depends on how each organization measures a shutdown. \nZach Rosson, a researcher who studies internet disruptions at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, told TechCrunch that according to its data, the ongoing shutdown in Iran is on a path to crack the top 10 longest shutdowns in history. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIran’s government has a long track record of shutting down access to the internet at times of protest and civil unrest, often making it more difficult to monitor the protests from outside of the country. \nA U.S.-based human rights group estimates that there have been more than 600 protests in cities across Iran, and according to one estimate, the Iranian government’s violent crackdown has led to the deaths of at least 2,000 people.\nThe shutdown in Iran on January 8 was sudden, cutting government institutions like the foreign ministry from the internet. Since then, some government departments, and some parts of the economy, such as bank transfers and payment processors at gas stations, had their access restored, as The Financial Times reported this week.\nAccording to The Guardian, a relatively small but unknown number of Iranians have been using Starlink terminals smuggled into the country to connect to the internet. In 2022, the Biden administration carved an exemption to the U.S. government’s sanctions against Iran to “increase support for internet freedom,” and allow U.S. tech companies to provide connectivity to Iranians for free, paving the way for Starlink to operate in Iran. \nAuthorities have since cracked down on Starlink users by making it illegal to own a Starlink terminal, jamming entire neighborhoods, and confiscating the devices.\nThis week, President Donald Trump threatened military intervention if Iranian forces continue to use violence, all the while reducing personnel at a military base in neighboring Qatar, amid concerns of a possible retaliatory strike. The U.S. military also reportedly redirected a naval strike group from the South China Sea to the Middle East. \nOn Wednesday, however, Trump said he had information that “the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” but conceded that, “who knows?”\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom shuttered its embassy in Iran’s capital Tehran and evacuated its staff. Iran temporarily closed off its airspace on Wednesday.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nIndia’s top court has ruled against Tiger Global in a tax case stemming from its Flipkart exit during Walmart’s 2018 takeover, a decision that strengthens New Delhi’s ability to challenge offshore treaty structures and could raise tax risk for global funds counting on predictable exits from one of the world’s fastest-growing major markets.\nOn Thursday, the Indian Supreme Court backed the tax authorities in a dispute over whether Tiger Global could use its Mauritius-based entities to claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty and avoid paying capital gains tax in India on profits linked to its exit in the Walmart–Flipkart deal. The decision set aside a 2024 Delhi High Court ruling that had overturned a 2020 order by the Authority for Advance Ruling, which had found the firm was, prima facie, avoiding tax and therefore not eligible for treaty relief.\nThe ruling is being closely watched by investors, as it strengthens India’s hand in challenging offshore “treaty-routing” structures that have long been used to reduce tax on high-value exits. It could also raise uncertainty over how future cross-border deals are structured and priced, at a time when foreign funds are counting on India as a key growth market.\nIn its verdict, a two-judge bench said (PDF) that when a transaction appears, at first glance, to be designed to avoid income tax, India’s advance-ruling mechanism cannot be used to seek protection.\nTiger Global first invested in India’s e-commerce firm Flipkart in 2009 with an initial $9 million investment, before increasing its exposure to about $1.2 billion over multiple funding rounds, TechCrunch had reported earlier. The firm later sold its stake to Walmart for about $1.4 billion in 2018.\nThe tax dispute centers on how Tiger Global structured that investment — through entities in Mauritius — and whether those vehicles could claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty to shield capital gains from Indian tax.\nWhile selling Flipkart’s stake during Walmart’s $16 billion deal, Tiger Global sought a certificate allowing no tax to be withheld, arguing that because the shares were acquired before April 1, 2017, the gains were exempt from Indian capital gains tax under a “grandfathering” clause, protecting older investments from the newer tax regime, in the India–Mauritius double taxation avoidance agreement. Indian tax authorities rejected the request in 2020, questioning the offshore structure chosen by the investment firm.\nThe Supreme Court bench framed the dispute as an issue of sovereign taxing powers, warning against structures that are designed primarily to dilute that authority.\n“Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right of that country,” the bench said, adding that “any dilution of this power through artificial arrangements is a direct threat to its sovereignty and long-term national interest.”\nThe judgment should be read as a caution against aggressive tax planning rather than a wholesale dismantling of the India–Mauritius treaty framework, Ajay Rotti, a tax expert and founder and CEO of tax advisory firm Tax Compass, wrote on X. He said the decision reinforces a broader shift toward “substance over form,” signaling treaty protection may not apply automatically where offshore entities lack real commercial activity.\nTiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm can seek a review of the verdict, though such petitions are rarely successful.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEthereal Exploration Guild, an Indian space tech better known as EtherealX, has climbed 5.5x in valuation to $80.5 million after its latest funding round. The startup is developing a launch vehicle designed to be fully reusable and is readying engine hot-fire tests ahead of its first technology demonstration flight, planned for 2027.\nThe Bengaluru-based company confirms that it closed an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital, as TechCrunch reported earlier. Accel, Prosus, YourNest, BlueHill, Campus Fund, and Riceberg Ventures also participated, EtherealX said. The raise follows a $5 million seed round in August 2024 that valued the startup at $14.6 million.\nAs India pushes to mature its space ecosystem beyond small launchers and component contracts — targeting growth in its space economy to $45 billion from $8 billion over the next decade — EtherealX is among the  startups drawing attention.\nSatellite operators worldwide are looking for more launch capacity and scheduling flexibility in a market where SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has set the benchmark for pricing and cadence. EtherealX is aiming for that space with its fully reusable vehicle designed to return both the booster and upper stage. That’s an approach that, if proven, could cut per-launch costs and increase flight frequency without relying on a native constellation to keep rockets fully booked.\nEtherealX is developing two engines in-house: the 80-kilonewton “Pegasus” upper-stage engine and the 1.2-meganewton “Stallion” booster engine, with hot-fire tests targeted for June–July. Thrust, measured in kilonewtons and meganewtons, indicates how much lifting force an engine can generate.\nThe startup is targeting a November–December 2027 launch window for a technology demonstration vehicle, ahead of commercial missions expected to begin toward the end of 2028, co-founder and CEO Manu J. Nair said in an interview.\nRocket engineers also track specific impulse, a widely used proxy for fuel efficiency, which — along with thrust — helps determine how much payload a vehicle can carry for a given amount of propellant.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Pegasus engine produces 323 seconds of vacuum-specific impulse and uses what the startup describes as a proprietary “full-flow segregated cooling cycle.” The engine integrates an in-house additively manufactured turbopump. Furthermore, the Stallion booster engine uses a gas-generator cycle and delivers 306 seconds of sea-level specific impulse.\nEtherealX’s additively manufactured turbopump assembly designed for the upper-stage engine.Image Credits:EtherealX\nNair told TechCrunch that EtherealX plans to cluster multiple engines per stage for its main medium-lift vehicle, called Razor Crest Mk-1, with nine Stallion engines on the booster and 15 Pegasus engines on the upper stage.\nFor comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 primarily reuses its first-stage booster while expending the upper stage. EtherealX is targeting deeper reusability by designing its vehicle to return both the booster and the upper stage.\nEtherealX’s vehicle aims to carry up to 24.8 tons in an expendable configuration, 22.8 tons partially reusable, and about 8 tons when fully reusable. The startup is targeting pricing of $350 to $2,000 per kilogram over time, Nair said, depending on configuration and cadence.\nTo support development, EtherealX operates a rocket engine test site in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, known as Base 001, which Nair said is focused on upper-stage engine qualification. The startup has also secured a 150-acre manufacturing and testing campus in Andhra Pradesh’s proposed space city that it expects to become operational from mid-2026 for integrated engine and stage testing.\nEtherealX has signed launch memoranda of understanding totaling around $130 million with customers, including Japan’s Space BD and Taiwan’s space agency, TASA, Nair said, as it seeks early commercial demand ahead of its first demonstration flight.\nThe latest funding will be used to complete flight qualification of the Stallion booster engine and to run clustered-firing tests of the Pegasus upper-stage engines, Nair said. To support that ramp-up, the startup currently employs 67 people and expects to grow to about 90 over the next two months as it increases manufacturing capacity and moves to a higher testing cadence ahead of its first demonstration flight.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday it has finalized an order that bans General Motors and its OnStar telematics service from sharing certain consumer data with consumer reporting agencies. The finalized order, which comes a year after the agency reached a proposed settlement with GM, also requires the automaker to be more transparent with its consumers and obtain their explicit consent on certain data collection.\nThe finalized order comes nearly two years after a New York Times report showed how GM and OnStar collected, used, and sold drivers’ precise geolocation data and driving behavior to third parties, including data brokers LexisNexis and Verisk. The data was collected through GM’s Smart Driver program, a free feature contained within its connected car apps that tracked and rated driving behaviors and seatbelt use. Data brokers sold this information to insurance providers, which could affect customers’ rates, the NYT reported at the time.\nGM discontinued the Smart Driver program in April 2024 across all of its brands, citing customer feedback. GM said at the time it unenrolled all customers and ended its third-party telematics relationships with LexisNexis and Verisk.\nThe FTC alleged that GM and OnStar used a misleading enrollment process to get consumers to sign up for its OnStar connected vehicle service and OnStar Smart Driver feature. The FTC also alleged the automaker failed to clearly disclose that the data would be collected and sold to third parties.\nUnder the order finalized Wednesday, GM is also required to obtain explicit consent from consumers prior to collecting, using, or sharing connected vehicle data. This process occurs at the dealership when a consumer buys a car from a GM brand. At that point, the OnStar system is linked to that particular vehicle VIN number and the new owner is asked whether they agree or not with data collection, according to GM.\nThere are some exceptions to the data collection ban, however. GM is allowed to share location data with emergency first responders and for internal research, the FTC said. GM confirmed this, noting it collects data for internal research and development and sometimes shares de-identified, or anonymized data (not associated with specific drivers or vehicles) with select partners to enhance city infrastructure and improve road safety. For instance, data has been shared with the University of Michigan, which used it for urban planning. \nGM must also establish a way for all U.S. consumers to request a copy of their data and seek its deletion and give them the ability to disable the collection of precise geolocation data from their vehicles. GM says it has already complied with these mandates.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGM says it began overhauling its policies and programs on data collection and privacy in 2024. For instance, the automaker said it has consolidated many of its U.S. privacy statements into a single, simpler statement and expanded its privacy program that allows customers to access and delete their personal information.\n“The Federal Trade Commission has formally approved the agreement reached last year with General Motors to address concerns,” an emailed statement from GM reads. “As vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly integral to the driving experience, GM remains committed to protecting customer privacy, maintaining trust, and ensuring customers have a clear understanding of our practices.” \nCorrection: The previous article incorrectly stated GM would be required to obtain their explicit consent on any data collection. The requirement is for certain data. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAs AI automates parts of the workforce, Emversity, an Indian workforce-training startup, is building talent pipelines for roles it sees AI can’t replace, and has raised $30 million in a new round to expand job-ready training in the world’s most populous market.\nThe all-equity Series A round was led by Premji Invest, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Z47, the Bengaluru-based startup announced on Thursday. The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.\nIndia has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have continued to flag a shortage. Hospitality, too, has faced a 55% to 60% demand-supply gap for workers, according to industry estimates.\nEmversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.\nThe two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.\nEmversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.\nSinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.”\nSinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter.\n“AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.”\nEmversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers.\nThe startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said.\nHe added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year.\nWith the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said.\nTo deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care.\nLast year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said.\nWhile Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand.\nEmversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network.\n"

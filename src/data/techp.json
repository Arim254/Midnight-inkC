It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.\nThis future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to reporting from IGN, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.\nThese Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its 18A manufacturing process, which started production in 2025.\nIntel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its Intel Arc GPUs.\nEntering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.\nRogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Gaming\n"

Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.\n“Since launching last fall, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we’ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.”\nMeta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.\nUnveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.\nAt CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.\nMeta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

Probably not mentioned at the show is that these gadgets might be creating a massive environmental problem.\nIt isn’t something that tends to get much attention, but a new study from Cornell University and the University of Chicago found that by 2050, demand for health wearables could hit 2 billion units per year, or 42 times more than today. Unless we change how they’re made, these devices could generate over a million tons of electronic waste and 100 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same period, the authors warn.\nAn even bigger surprise is that it’s not the plastic that’s the problem. The study, published in Nature, found that the printed circuit board — the device’s “brain” — accounts for 70% of its carbon footprint, largely due to intensive mining and manufacturing.\nThe researchers suggest two fixes: develop chips using common metals like copper instead of rare minerals like gold, and make devices modular so the circuit board can be reused while the outer covering gets replaced.\nWrote one of the study’s co-authors, “When these devices are deployed at global scale, small design choices add up quickly.” It’s something to think about while scrolling through CES announcements.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Biotech & Health\n"

    "body": "\nIf there is one point of consensus among the CES 2026 keynote speakers, it is that AI is reshaping technology with a speed and scale unlike any previous technological revolution.\nIn a live taping on Tuesday of the All-In podcast, co-host Jason Calacanis interviewed Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.\n“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.\nTaneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said. \nCalacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”\nCFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.\nAnother key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.\nMeanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.\nCalacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.\nSternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users.\n“You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote.\nHe claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity.\nThose claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually was sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story.\nPeople lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions.\nCasey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.\n“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.\nGenerative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.\nMax Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.\n“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”\nTools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.\nCase in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else. Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nLMArena, a startup that originally launched as a UC Berkeley research project in 2023, announced on Tuesday that it raised a $150 million Series A at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion. The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund, UC Investments.\nThe startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a $100 million seed round in May at a $600 million valuation. This new round means it raised $250 million in about seven months.\nLMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.\nThe models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.\nThe company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang, and was originally funded through grants and donations.\nLMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.\nIn September, it publicly launched a commercial service, AI Evaluations, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat trajectory, and the startup’s popularity, were enough for VCs to pile in for the Series A, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, The House Fund, LDVP, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Laude Ventures.\n"

    "body": "\nAMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone.\nAs part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.\nThe semiconductor giant revealed the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, the latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.\nThese new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction.\nThis is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.\nRahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.\n“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.\n“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”\nPCs that include either the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.\nThe game was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.\n\nLaunching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.\nAs with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.\nIt’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a hidden emoji game in DMs last year. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.\nThe internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently expanded its Communities feature with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it added a “disappearing posts” feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.\nWhile Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Ying Tang/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12:22 PM PST · January 6, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSenator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”\n“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”\nThe bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.\nOver the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.\nWhile the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.\nOpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026. \n“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nMobileye made its name, and money, by supplying automakers with millions of computer vision chips designed to support automotive safety features and advanced driver assistance systems. The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software. \nNow, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.\nThe Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.\nThe transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.\n“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”\nMentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap. \nThe benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023. \nOf course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute. \nThe acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nKate Lowry, a former vice president at Insight Partners, is suing the firm, alleging disability discrimination, gender discrimination, and wrongful termination, according to a suit filed on December 30 in San Mateo County, California, and seen by TechCrunch. Insight Partners did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nLowry told TechCrunch she filed the suit because she believes “too many powerful, wealthy people in venture act like it’s OK to break the law and systemically underpay and abuse their employees.”\n“It’s an oppressive system that reflect[s] broader trends in society that use fear, intimidation, and power to silence and isolate truth. I’m trying to change that.”\nLowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey & Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.  \nShe alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”  \nLowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.  \nSome comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.  \nWhen she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”  \nIn September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market. \nBy April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.  \nThe lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and other women went on to sue major tech companies.  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.\nAnnounced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.\nAmazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.\nAnd as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.\nNotably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.\nAmazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.\nFor people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.\nNarwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. \nImage Credits:Narwal\nThe Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.\nNarwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.\nImage Credits:Narwal\nAlong with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhile CES 2026 is full of tech giants unveiling their latest innovations, the real excitement comes from discovering unexpected, quirky gadgets that make you ask, “Who thought of this?”\nWe’re here to spotlight the wildest products we’ve found so far at CES 2026, from an AI-powered panda that responds to your touch, to Razer’s holographic anime assistant, and plenty more weirdness that makes you do a double-take.\nAn AI anime companion that watches you from your desk \n\nRazer’s Project AVA, originally introduced last year as an esports AI coach, has evolved into something new: a 5.5-inch animated holographic desk companion that can assist with gaming strategies, productivity, daily organization, and even personal advice. It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane. \nThese digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product.\nA cuddly AI baby panda robot for older adults\nAI Panda An’An rests by the window on the deskImage Credits:Mind With Heart Robotics\nAn’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care. \nThe panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise\nImage Credits:GoveeLife\nSmart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud. \n​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.\nAn ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing\nImage Credits:Seattle Ultrasonics\nDepending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle. \nThe knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.\nA musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head\nImage Credits:Lollipop Star\nMusical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).\n"

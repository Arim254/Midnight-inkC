    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n5:20 PM PST · December 4, 2025\n\nImage Credits:SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nThe Chicago Tribune filed a lawsuit against AI search engine Perplexity on Thursday alleging copyright infringement. The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York.\nThe Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims.\nThe Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. \nInterestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles.\nThe Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material: eight sued in April and another nine sued in November. Those suit are ongoing.\nWhile creators have filed many lawsuits against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well.\nPerplexity did not immediately respond to the Chicago Tribune’s story about its own lawsuit, nor to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Perplexity is facing other such suits. Reddit filed one in October. Dow Jones is also suing. Last month, while Amazon didn’t sue, it did threaten to by sending a cease-and-desist letter over AI browser shopping.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCorrection: This article originally misstated the number publications jointly suing OpenAI and Microsoft across two lawsuits.

In the letter, Petco said that it identified “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” adding that the company discovered the issue on its own, and “immediately took steps to correct the issue and to remove the files from further online access.”\nThe letter, however, does not specify what type of customers’ personal information was exposed during the security lapse.\nPetco spokesperson Ventura Olvera told TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” \nOlvera did not respond to a series of follow-up questions, including how many customers were affected by the incident, and what type of personal data was exposed.\nCalifornia law requires that companies disclose data breaches involving 500 or more state residents, suggesting at least 500 Petco customers in California are affected. Petco has also notified an unspecified number of people in Massachusetts, and three people in the state of Montana, according to the state’s website.\nThe company said it is also offering free credit and identity theft monitoring services to the victims.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Rockstar Games\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:25 AM PST · December 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe latest expansion to Grand Theft Auto Online includes robotaxis from a fictional-yet-familiar company dubbed “KnoWay,” whose sole purpose appears to be wreaking havoc.\nA trailer released Friday shows KnoWay vans adorned with lidar sensors swerving through city streets, wrecking other cars, and crashing through a billboard for the made up company. \nWhile that’s all far more chaotic and destructive than even some of the worst behavior that Waymo’s robotaxis have been guilty of, the in-game autonomous vehicles nonetheless resemble the company’s earlier-generation Chrysler Pacifica vans. The expansion is called “A Safehouse in the Hills” and is available starting December 10.\nIt’s not clear if the vans in the trailer have been, in true Grand Theft Auto fashion, hijacked by playable characters, or if they’ve gone rogue. It seems likely it’s the latter, though, as Rockstar Games says players will be encouraged to “stop the development of a mass surveillance network in an all-new action-packed adventure” as part of the DLC. (The trailer also teases a storyline that involves an AI assistant named “Haviland,” so the tech world in general appears to be a part of this particular storyline.)\nWaymo has said it will deny government requests for the footage its vehicles capture if those requests are “overly broad and unlawful.” But its robotaxis have nevertheless drawn criticism for being part of a growing surveillance state. That frustration has contributed to the company’s vehicles becoming a target of multiple instances of vandalism. Waymo SUVs have been burned, smashed, and had their tires slashed in different cities over the last few years.\nRockstar is clearly tapping into those same dynamics here, as the tagline for KnoWay’s “autonomous hailing system” in the game is: “We Kno where you’re going.” It’s not hard to imagine some players of the DLC taking some of their frustrations out on the virtual vehicles once the update is released later this month.\nWaymo declined to comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana spoke out against the vandalism, saying her company was “very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nThe launch of Hamlet was quite personal for Sunil Rajaraman.\nBack in 2022, he ran for city council in a small California town. He lost, but the moment forever changed the way he saw the place — and local governments, for that matter. \n“I was trying to become a better candidate,” he recalled to TechCrunch. “I wanted to understand how my city actually worked, what decisions had been made, why, who said what. And I couldn’t figure it out. It’s a total black box, and almost intentionally opaque.”\nSince COVID, towns across the nation have started recording and posting their city meetings online. That gave Rajaraman an idea: a company that helped people understand what was happening in local governments. That same year, in 2022, he launched Hamlet to do just that.\n“We use AI to process thousands of hours of city council and planning commission meeting videos and turn them into intelligence they can actually use,” he said. He said these videos are better than meeting minutes because those documents are just someone’s interpretations of what happened. “The video doesn’t lie.”\nAt first, he thought it would be a media company, but then real estate developers and political action committees started reaching out. Rajaraman realized that private companies have to deal with local governments, too, and they also want more insight into what is happening in those city council meetings.\nFor enterprise customers, the company helps track agendas and alerts them when relevant topics are addressed across target cities. It also synthesizes what happened after meetings, so they don’t have to watch hourslong videos, and it lets them search the video archive to see, for example, when and how a competitor was mentioned in a local government setting.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHamlet has raised around $10 million in venture funding to date, from backers including Slow Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Banana Capital, and Kapor Capital. “We want to become the ‘Bloomberg’ of this space, so to speak,” Rajaraman said.\nOn Friday, Rajaraman announced he is expanding the company to launch Hamlet TV as a way to help keep regular citizens informed of what is happening inside their governments. The streaming channel is on TikTok, YouTube, AppleTV, and Instagram, and will spotlight important moments from council, commission, and school board meetings.\nRajaraman said his company has processed thousands of hours of government meetings for government customers.\n“We’ve seen meetings that have lasted 15-plus hours without recess,” he said. He and his team started curating funny moments from those meetings, and they thought it was a good idea to use humor to get people more invested in the U.S. democracy. “If you show people procedural videos, they are just not going to care. But if you show them the funny stuff, they’ll watch.”  \nThe most surprising thing he and his team have seen so far on Hamlet TV has been someone dressing up as a cockroach to address their city council about a pest problem. But it’s not the funny stuff that surprises him, he said. “It’s how consequential these meetings are and how invisible they remain.”\nHe cited an example from earlier this year when the Tucson city council rejected Amazon’s $3.6 billion data center. He said that the decision came after months of planning, but only a few people likely watched those videos to understand why it happened.  \nThis isn’t Rajaraman’s first time running a business — or a media outlet. He co-founded the analytics platform Scripted and was twice the Entrepreneur in Residence at Foundation Capital. He also ran a publication called The Bold Italic and then sold it to Medium.\nHe knows Hamlet TV probably won’t be a moneymaker and reiterated that he’s doing this to get people more involved with the state of the country’s democracy. He also plans to give away the Hamlet tool to local journalists for free. “Data is great, but context matters so much,” he said.\nNext, the Hamlet company is looking to work with government affairs, advocacy organizations, and renewable energy developers. “Democracy works better when people are watching,” he said. “We’re trying to make watching possible.”\n"

    "body": "\nIf Amazon Web Services’ annual re:Invent tech conference proves anything, it’s that the cloud infrastructure player is going all in on AI. \nAWS made dozens of announcements, from new AI agents and updated large language models, to products with LLM and agent-building capabilities. AI for enterprise was everywhere. But are its customers just as eager?\nAWS CEO Matt Garman acknowledged during his keynote that enterprises haven’t seen a return on AI investment yet. He thinks that’s about to change — and fast.\n“I believe that the advent of AI agents has brought us to an inflection point in AI’s trajectory,” Garman said. “It’s turning from a technical wonder into something that delivers us real value. This change is going to have as much impact on your business as the internet or the cloud.”\nWhile analysts told TechCrunch they were impressed by some of AWS’ tech announcements this week, they aren’t sure it’s enough to move the needle on enterprise AI adoption or change AWS’ position in the AI race.\nAWS is one of the market leaders when it comes to cloud infrastructure; the same can’t be said for its enterprise AI offerings.\nAnthropic, OpenAI, and Google hold a commanding lead when it comes to enterprise market share for actual AI models. AWS does have the advantage of having everything in house, including infrastructure and its own AI training chips.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNaveen Chhabra, a principal analyst at Forrester, told TechCrunch over email that while AWS announced a lot of cool new technology, it doesn’t change the fact that many enterprises aren’t ready to adopt AI. \n“AWS AI announcements show that AWS is thinking ahead and maybe far too ahead,” Chhabra wrote. “Most enterprises are still piloting AI projects and are rarely at the levels of maturity AWS expects them to be to take advantage of the offerings that come out of these announcements.”\nA widely cited MIT study from August found that 95% of enterprises aren’t seeing a return on investment from AI.\nEthan Feller, an equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told TechCrunch in a phone interview that the new Nova AI models, agents, and model-building capabilities weren’t what stood out to him as interesting from this week — despite these being the products AWS hyped the most. Instead, it was the infrastructure announcements.\n“The AWS AI factory is really compelling,” Feller said about a new initiative that allows customers to run AWS AI in their own data centers. “AWS is a huge player in where the models are being run and is dominant in the cloud industry. I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.”\nFeller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology.\nDespite all of this, AWS is still well-positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses.\nAWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is.\nIf the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded $11.4 billion in operating income in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers.\nThis gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here, and see all the announcements you may have missed thus far here.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "description": "The battery storage industry in the U.S. has grown in leaps and bounds in recent years, surpassing its most aggressive targets to become one of the largest new sources of power on the grid.",
    "body": "\nNearly a decade ago, when the energy storage market was in its infancy, an industry organization set a dreamy goal: By the end of 2025, the U.S. would deploy 35 gigawatts of batteries connected to the grid.\nSo how’d the storage industry do? In the third quarter, 4.7 gigawatts of batteries were installed. In sum, more than 40 gigawatts have been deployed, and the year isn’t over, Canary Media reported. In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.\nWhat’s more, that’s nearly half of all new renewable power deployed on the grid for July through September, and this year, renewables have been the leading source of all new capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nMuch of the new storage capacity has been deployed in Arizona, California, and Texas, states where the grid has been strained in recent years. Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.\nStartups have been taking note. \nRedwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a new business line focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds. \nBy 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, investing another $350 million in the company to propel the new business line. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup raised $1 billion in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion beyond Texas. The company has deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours of batteries in Texas. \nWhile lithium-ion batteries have dominated new installations, other startups are pursuing other technologies that could lower storage costs significantly. \nSizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean. Fourth Power is using blocks of carbon to store heat at super-high temperatures, and it’s looking to deploy them in 2028 at a cost that’s lower than lithium-ion batteries or peaking natural gas power plants. XL Batteries is deploying its flow-battery technology at petrochemical storage sites, allowing it to store hundreds of megawatt-hours using existing infrastructure. And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.\nAltogether, it points to an industry that’s in the midst of an exponential expansion. Paired with solar and wind, which remain the cheapest forms of new electricity, energy storage has the potential to rewire global energy markets, and the U.S. grid along with them.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nIn one of the most groundbreaking deals the streaming world has ever seen, Netflix announced on Friday its acquisition of Warner Bros. with an enterprise value of $82.7 billion. \nThis agreement involves both HBO Max and the HBO studio, marking one of the largest mergers in Hollywood’s history. By making this move, Netflix is not just solidifying its top position but also significantly enhancing its content library, gaining access to well-known franchises such as DC Comics, “Game of Thrones,” and “Harry Potter.” \nWhile Netflix boasted over 300 million paying subscribers in January, HBO Max, in combination with Discovery+, currently has around 128 million subscribers.\nAdditionally, the scale of Netflix’s offer is notable, as the streaming giant is investing $72 billion, which exceeds Warner Bros.’ entire market valuation of $60 billion.\nHowever, this merger isn’t without its challenges; it could face antitrust scrutiny. \nIn November, senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal expressed concerns regarding the potential sale. The trio sent a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division indicating that any agreement would be viewed “under a cloud of political favoritism and corruption.”\nAdditionally, various industry players are expressing their views. According to Variety, an anonymous group reportedly sent a letter to Congress urging them to publicly oppose Netflix’s offer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWarner Bros. Discovery officially put itself up for sale in October, burdened by debt and disappointing streaming growth. The company attracted interest from several suitors, with Paramount seen as the frontrunner.\nThe acquisition is expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2026, after Warner Bros. Discovery follows through with its plan to separate from Discovery Global, which includes its collection of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN.\nThe companies estimate that the transaction, a mix of cash and stock, will be completed within 12 to 18 months.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

Reuters was the first to report on the letter, which comes two months since the agency opened an investigation into Waymo over how its robotaxis perform around stopped school buses.\nThe agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into the Alphabet-owned company in October after seeing footage of a Waymo autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street.\nWaymo has said the bus was partially blocking the driveway and that the robotaxi could not see the flashing lights or stop sign. \nWaymo also said it issued a software update to its fleet to improve performance.\nReports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing school buses has continued even after the fix. The Austin School District has reported 19 different instances of Waymo automated vehicles illegally passing school buses since the beginning of the 2025-26 school year. The school district noted in a letter to Waymo that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software on November 17.\nIn an emailed statement, Waymo said safety is its top priority. The company also said data shows its robotaxis are improving road safety, noting a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and 12x fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We have already made software updates to improve our performance and are committed to continuous improvement,” the statement continued. “NHTSA plays a vital role in road safety, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the agency as part of our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver.”\nWaymo contends that the software updates have meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this area.\nAustin School District seems to disagree and has asked Waymo to cease operations during certain times of the day when students are arriving and departing school.\n“Waymo’s software updates are clearly not working as intended nor as quickly as required,” the district’s November 20 letter to Waymo reads. “We cannot allow Waymo to continue endangering our students while it attempts to implement a fix. Accordingly, Austin ISD demands that Waymo immediately cease operation of its automated vehicles during the hours of 5:20 a.m. – 9:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m., until more in-depth software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.”\nFederal regulators with the Office of Defects Investigation sent Waymo a letter four days later noting that it had been alerted by Austin school district officials. The investigators asked if Waymo had ceased operations, per the school district’s request, if its software fix mitigated this concern, and if Waymo planned to file a recall?\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "description": "The EC is taking issue with the fact that X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, has been allowing anyone to buy a \"blue checkmark,\" the platform's long-standing symbol that a user has been verified to be who they are claiming to be.",
    "body": "\nThe European Commission (EC) has imposed its first fine under Europe’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), and it’s against Elon Musk’s X.\nThe EC is taking issue with the fact that X has been allowing anyone to buy a “blue checkmark,” the platform’s long-standing symbol which used to indicate that a user has been verified to be who they are claiming to be.\nCalling the design of the blue checkmark system “deceptive,” the European Union’s executive arm on Friday imposed a fine of €120 million (about $140 million) on X, saying the company had breached its transparency obligations under the DSA. \nThe Commission said other breaches of the law include a lack of transparency of X’s advertising repository and failure to provide researchers access to public data.\nBefore Musk bought the company, Twitter used to issue blue checks to journalists, celebrities, politicians, and public figures on the platform after it had verified their identity. Musk did away with that policy in 2023, and all the “verified” blue check today indicates is that a user subscribes to X Premium, and that they meet certain eligibility criteria, like having a profile photo, a display name, and have linked their account to a phone number.\n“X’s use of the ‘blue checkmark’ for ‘verified accounts’ deceives users,” the Commission wrote in a statement. “This violates the DSA obligation for online platforms to prohibit deceptive design practices on their services. On X, anyone can pay to obtain the ‘verified’ status without the company meaningfully verifying who is behind the account, making it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and content they engage with.”\nThe Commission added that such a system exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud, and manipulation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe regulator also found that X’s advertisement repository doesn’t comply with DSA requirements for transparency and accessibility, saying the company imposes excessive delays in processing requests for access. The Commission also said the ads repository doesn’t house important information like the content or topic of ads, as well as who paid for those ads.\n“This hinders researchers and the public to independently scrutinise any potential risks in online advertising,” the Commission wrote.\nAccess to public data is another area of concern for the EU. The DSA mandates that public platforms allow researchers access to public data to study systemic risks, and the EC’s investigation has found that X does not allow researchers to independently do that.\n“Moreover, X’s processes for researchers’ access to public data impose unnecessary barriers, effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union,” the EC wrote.\nThe decision comes two years after the EC launched an investigation into the company on the suspected breach of rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency, and data access for researchers.\n“Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads, and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU,” Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy at the European Commission, said in a statement.\nX now has 60 days to outline how it intends to address the complaint about the blue checkmarks, and 90 days to respond with an action plan for addressing the breaches relating to ads and public data transparency and accessibility.\nConfirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nIn its latest retreat from India’s crowded online retail market, Walmart-backed fintech giant PhonePe has wound down its Pincode e-commerce app and will shift the business toward B2B services for offline merchants.\nOn Thursday, PhonePe founder and group CEO Sameer Nigam said operating a consumer-facing quick-commerce app had become a distraction from the company’s core focus on small retailers. The company instead wants to concentrate on helping stores “achieve operational efficiency, improved margins and visibility,” he said, citing this as its primary objective. \nPhonePe launched Pincode in April 2023 as a major push into e-commerce, building it on the Indian government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The hyperlocal app offered groceries, medicines, food, electronics, and home décor from neighborhood shops. It rolled out first in Bengaluru and later expanded to other cities.\nWithin a little over a year of launch, Pincode pulled out of most categories except food. Earlier this year, the app shifted to a quick-commerce model, offering 10-minute deliveries through local kirana shops and retailers in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. The company also expanded the service to 10-minute medicine deliveries in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune in April.\nPhonePe’s Pincode utilized local shops and retail stores for its quick deliveries — a contrast to rivals like Swiggy, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto, which rely on dark stores. The shift did not help Pincode gain ground in the crowded segment, prompting PhonePe to wind down the service.\nPincode was not PhonePe’s first move into e-commerce. In 2019, the company launched “Switch,” a super-app layer inside its payments app that offered access to food, grocery, shopping, and travel services.\nPhonePe has now shut down the Pincode app and redirected its website to PhonePe’s main site. The company said it will now focus on working with offline retailers by expanding its B2B offerings. In July, PhonePe said it had digitized over 1,000 local stores across Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Varanasi through Pincode, giving them access to digital storefronts, inventory tools, and last-mile delivery services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“As part of this strategic decision, we will now focus the entire Pincode team’s resources towards accelerating the build-out and scale-up of a suite of B2B business solutions for offline businesses across India,” Vivek Lohcheb, CEO of Pincode, said in a prepared statement.\nPhonePe already offers inventory and order-management tools, as well as other ERP software for small businesses, and provides direct sourcing and replenishment services in some categories.\nThe shift comes as PhonePe prepares for a public listing in India, nearly three years after its spin-off from Flipkart. The company filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India through the confidential pre-filing route in September and is targeting a mid-2026 listing. PhonePe is also looking for ways to grow beyond its position as the country’s dominant payments app on the Unified Payments Interface.\nPhonePe did not respond to detailed questions about Pincode’s performance and the timing of the app’s shutdown.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple’s executive shake-up continues. Days after announcing AI chief John Giannandrea’s departure, and the loss of design exec Alan Dye to Meta, the iPhone maker shared the news of two more exec retirements.\nKate Adams, who has served as Apple’s general counsel since 2017, will retire late next year, while Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, will retire in late January 2026.\nThe company also announced the hiring of Jennifer Newstead, who will become its general counsel on March 1, 2026, reporting to chief executive Tim Cook, after a transition of duties from Adams.\nNewstead arrives from Meta, where she was chief legal officer. Before that, she served as the legal adviser of the U.S. Department of State, where she led the team advising the secretary of state on legal issues affecting the conduct of U.S. foreign relations.\nShe also held other government positions in the past, including as general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as a principal deputy assistant attorney general of the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, as associate White House counsel, and as a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court. \nNewstead will oversee both the Legal and Government Affairs organizations, noted Cook.\n“We couldn’t be more pleased to have Jennifer join our team,” he said. “She brings an extraordinary depth of experience and skill to the role, and will advance Apple’s important work all over the world.” \nDuring Adams’ time at Apple, the company faced increased antitrust regulation and lawsuits, largely focused on increasing competition in the app market.\nMeanwhile, Jackson, who had previously been appointed to the EPA before joining Apple in 2013, was involved with Apple’s climate initiatives, sustainability efforts, environmental impact, and DEI-focused endeavors, like its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. Such efforts have fallen out of favor at corporate giants under the Trump administration.\n“I am deeply appreciative of Lisa’s contributions. She has been instrumental in helping us reduce our global greenhouse emissions by more than 60 percent compared to 2015 levels,” said Cook in a statement. “She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security.”\nApple has seen a number of changes in leadership in recent months, having also announced the departure of chief operating officer Jeff Williams in July, with duties shifting to Sabih Khan, who had previously served as the senior vice president of operations. Before Giannandrea’s exit, Apple had replaced him as head of the Siri team with Mike Rockwell, who had been VP of the Vision Products Group.\nThe company also lost Ke Yang, the executive leading Apple’s work on AI-driven web search, to Meta; and it saw the departure of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s former head of AI models, who left for Meta earlier this year.\nThe leadership changes as Apple has fallen behind in the AI race, pushing back the launch of an AI-powered Siri, which will now run Google’s models under the hood. Apple has also been criticized by designers for losing its sharp attention to detail that the company has long been known for. This reportedly led to some celebration of Dye’s departure among Apple employees, per a report from Daring Fireball, who are glad that a career interface and interaction designer, Stephen Lemay, has taken over the role.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said in an X post Thursday that owners can text and drive with the latest version of his company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver-assistance software, despite the fact that it’s illegal to do so in most states.\nMusk replied to another user who had noticed the newest update to the software, known as FSD, was not flashing a warning as he used his phone while driving. The Tesla CEO wrote the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.”\nMusk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nNearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. \nDespite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. Drivers initially needed to have their hands on the wheel even when FSD was engaged. That requirement was later removed and allowed drivers to have hands off as long as the in-cabin camera detected they were paying attention to the road. \nFSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver-assistance systems.\nMusk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver-assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident. Regulators have found more than a dozen fatal crashes in which Autopilot was active.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently investigating the FSD software after it discovered more than 50 reports of it running red lights or crossing into the wrong lanes. The NHTSA is also probing FSD for reported crashes in low-visibility conditions. The NHTSA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTesla is also near the end of a long legal battle with the California Department of Motor Vehicles over how the company has marketed FSD and its less-capable predecessor, Autopilot. During a series of hearings in July, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading customers for years that their cars can drive themselves. The state agency has asked a judge to suspend the company’s sale and manufacturing of its cars for at least 30 days. A decision in that case is expected by the end of this year.\nCorrection: Tesla Autopilot requires hands on while engaged. FSD initially required hands on and later removed that requirement. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMicro1’s rapid climb over the past two years has pushed it into a cohort of AI companies scaling at breakneck speed. The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).\nToday, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it announced its $35 million Series A at a $500 million valuation.\nAnsari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years.\nMicro1’s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with Scale AI following Meta’s $14 billion investment in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale’s CEO.\nWhile Micro1’s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn’t yet matched its rivals: Mercor’s more than $450 million, sources told TechCrunch, and Surge’s reported $1.2 billion in 2024.\nAnsari attributes Micro1’s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform.\nBeyond supplying expert-level data to leading AI labs, Ansari says two new segments, still barely visible today, are on track to reshape the economics of human data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe first involves non-AI-native Fortune 1000 enterprises that will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks. \nDeveloping these agents requires systematic evaluation: testing frontier models, grading their output, choosing winners, fine-tuning them, and continuously validating performance in production. Ansari argues this cycle depends heavily on human experts evaluating AI behavior at scale.\nThe second is robotics pre-training, which requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls the world’s largest robotics pre-training dataset, collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. Robotics companies will need vast volumes of this data before their systems can reliably operate in homes and offices, he said.\n“We anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non-AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,” said the CEO, who founded Micro1 while at UC Berkeley. “We’re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion-a-year market.”\nEven as new markets emerge, Micro1’s current growth still comes primarily from elite AI labs and AI-heavy enterprises. The startup is scaling its work with these labs on reinforcement learning, the feedback loop  to test and improve model behavior.\n\nMicro1 hopes its early move into robotics data and enterprise agent development, in addition to scaling its specialized RL environments, will help it capture additional market share as the data wars intensify.\nFor now, Ansari says the company is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines. \nThe company currently manages thousands of experts across hundreds of domains, ranging from highly technical fields to surprisingly offline disciplines. Many earn close to $100 an hour, according to Ansari.\n“There are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,” Ansari said. “But the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It’s expanding into areas you wouldn’t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields. We’re very optimistic about where this is heading.”\n\n\n\t\tTage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

    "body": "\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei shared his thoughts on if the AI industry was in a bubble at The New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday. This was in addition to throwing shade on one particular unnamed competitor, which was clearly OpenAI.\nAmodei declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer to the question of a bubble, saying it was a complex situation, but instead explained his thoughts about the economics of AI in more detail.\nHe described himself as bullish on the potential of the technology, but cautioned that there could be players in the ecosystem who might make a “timing error” or could see “bad things” happen when it comes to the economic payoffs.\n“There’s an inherent risk when the timing of the economic value is uncertain,” Amodei explained. He said companies had to take risks to compete with each other and authoritarian adversaries — a reference to the threat from China — but added that some players were not “managing that risk well, who are taking unwise risks.”  \nThe issue, he said, is the uncertainty around how quickly the economic value of AI will grow and properly mapping that to the lag times on building more data centers.\n“There’s [a] genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,” Amodei said. “And then I think there are some players who are ‘YOLO-ing,’ who pull the risk dial too far, and I’m very concerned,” he added, using the slang term for “you only live once,” which is often used to justify risk-taking.\nPlus, he spoke to the question around AI chips’ deprecation timelines. That’s another hot-button topic and a factor that could negatively impact the industry’s economics if GPUs become obsolete and lose their value ahead of schedule.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The issue isn’t the lifetime of the chips — chips keep working for a long time. The issue is new chips come out that are faster and cheaper…and so the value of old chips can go down somewhat,” Amodei said.\nHe said Anthropic was making conservative assumptions on this front and others as it planned for an uncertain future.\nThe AI company’s revenue has grown 10x per year over the past three years, the CEO said, going from zero to $100 million in 2023, then $100 million to $1 billion in 2024, and will land somewhere between $8-10 billion by the end of this year. \nBut Amodei said he would be “really dumb” to just assume that the pattern would continue. “I don’t know if a year from now, if it’s going to be 20 billion or if it’s going to be 50…it’s very uncertain. I try to plan conservatively. So I plan for the lower side of it, but that is very disconcerting,” he said.\nAI companies like his have to plan how much compute they’ll need in the years ahead, and how much they should invest in data centers. If they don’t buy enough, they may not be able to serve their customers. And if they buy too much, they’ll struggle to keep up with costs or, in the worst-case scenario, they could go bankrupt. \nLast month, OpenAI landed in a PR crises when its CFO said she wanted the U.S. government to “backstop” her company’s infrastructure loans, aka insure them so taxpayers would pick of the bill if OpenAI could not. After the furor, she walked back the comments. \nThose who take more risks could overextend themselves, Amodei warned, especially if “you’re a person who just kind of, like constitutionally, just wants to ‘YOLO’ things, or just likes big numbers,” he said, in a veiled reference to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n“We think we’re going to be okay in, basically, almost all worlds…I can’t speak for other companies,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nChatGPT’s growth is starting to taper off, according to new data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Today, the OpenAI-owned AI chatbot remains the leader in the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the global monthly active users. However, Google’s Gemini has begun to outpace ChatGPT in terms of download growth, growth of monthly active users, and growth of time spent in app, the firm found. \nOver time, that increased pace of adoption could help Gemini narrow the gap with ChatGPT. That’s something OpenAI is now worried about, as its recent “code red” memo indicated. The missive, penned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, instructed staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and more. \nWhen looking at the recent data, it’s clear the race is not over yet: both ChatGPT and Gemini continue to see sizable growth. \nChatGPT has seen its global monthly active users climb by 180% year-over-year as of November 2025, while Gemini’s monthly active users are up 170%. \nImage Credits:Sensor Tower\nBut the new data indicates that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew by around 6% from August to November, to reach roughly 810 million. (The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says.\nMeanwhile, Google’s Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption. \nIn addition, the report noted that around 2 times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mobile app or web interface. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGemini is also increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared across all top apps like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. Over the past seven months (May-Nov. 2025), Gemini increased its share of global monthly active users by 3 percentage points, the firm estimates. \nBut ChatGPT saw its share of global monthly active users drop 3 percentage points over the past four months (Aug.-Nov. 2025), by comparison. \nChallenges from Perplexity and Claude may also be impacting ChatGPT, as both rivals saw triple-digit growth for their respective chatbots in 2025, with the former up 370% year-over-year, and the latter up 190%. \nImage Credits:Sensor Tower\nChatGPT also saw its global downloads grow by 85% year-over-year as of November, but this lagged the overall cohort’s average growth of 110%. \nPerplexity and Gemini saw the largest growth, up 215% and 190% year-over-year, respectively.\nFinally, Gemini app users’ time spent in the app has more than doubled over the past few months, Sensor Tower said. As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up 120% from March. This is likely due to the popularity of its image generation model, Nano Banana, in September. \nChatGPT’s users’ daily time spent only increased by 6% during the same time frame. Plus, ChatGPT users’ time spent was down 10% in November, compared with July. \nWhile the current data indicates Google could be catching up with the market leader, much of its recent gains have to do with the success of Nano Banana. OpenAI could speed up growth again with the release of its own new products, if they make a similar impact. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

For decades, expectant mothers have been racing against biology in the back seats of taxis and Ubers from London to Los Angeles. There was the mother in India who named her son Uber after giving birth to him en route to the hospital (the driver reportedly helped in the delivery). There was also the California couple in 2017 who welcomed their baby in an Uber during Shabbat.”Everyone is telling us to name the baby Uber,” the father joked, before adding, “But we can’t do that.” (Ah, though, they could have!)\nThe stories go on and on. Now, Silicon Valley has automated the experience, at least partially.\nThe vehicle in San Francisco was promptly removed for cleaning. Further, this wasn’t Waymo’s first birth — the company told the Standard that a Phoenix baby got there first. “While this is a very rare occurrence,” a Waymo spokesperson deadpanned, “some of our newest riders just can’t wait to experience their first Waymo ride.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

Last year, TIME chose President Donald Trump for the second time. The year before that, it was Taylor Swift, who many claimed saved the economy from a recession with her Eras Tour. In 1938, the magazine chose Adolf Hitler. \nThis year, TIME has chosen to bestow its award on not just one person, but a group of people: the so-called “Architects of AI,” comprising the CEOs shaping the global AI race from the U.S. With AI on everyone’s minds, embodying hope for a small minority and economic anxiety for a majority, per recent Edelman data, this  tracks.\n“For decades, humankind steeled itself for the rise of thinking machines,” the article reads. “Leaders striving to develop the technology, including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, warned that the pursuit of its powers could create unforeseen catastrophe […] This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible.”\nBased on one of TIME’s two cover photos, some of those people appear to be Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Tesla’s Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, AMD’s Lisa Su, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis, and World Labs’s Fei-Fei Li — all individuals who raced “both beside and against each other.” \nTIME writes that these individuals, through their multi-billion-dollar bets on “one of the biggest physical infrastructure projects of all time,” have reshaped government policy, turned up the heat on geopolitical competition, and pushed AI adoption forward. \n\n“This is the story of how AI changed our world in 2025, in new and exciting and sometimes frightening ways. It is the story of how Huang and other tech titans grabbed the wheel of history, developing technology and making decisions that are reshaping the information landscape, the climate, and our livelihoods… AI emerged as arguably the most consequential tool in great-power competition since the advent of nuclear weapons.”\n\nTIME only announced the news on Thursday morning, but images of the cover photo were leaked on prediction market Polymarket on Wednesday evening.\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAI, AI, dario amodei, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musk, Fei-Fei Li, Jensen Huang, Lisa Su, Mark Zuckerberg, person of the year, sam altman, time\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

So if you have a friend who is passionate about tennis, you can send them a digital card that lets them shop for outfits and gear from popular brands like Wilson, On, Prince, and more. \nThe platform offers gift cards across 72 categories that range from running and reading to camping, gardening, gaming and concerts.\nYou can also attach video messages, photos and GIFs to gift cards, which is a nice touch as it lets you add a layer of personalization. You can use On Me via its website as well as iOS and Android apps.\nImage Credits:On Me\nThe startup’s CEO and co-founder Darragh Meaney pointed out the environmental issues with the traditional gift card industry, which rely heavily on plastic. \nThe International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA) reports that approximately 30 billion plastic cards are manufactured globally each year, and that over 70% of gift cards are discarded within six months, resulting in an estimated 53 million tons of plastic waste.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It is an environmentally wasteful practice that feels totally disconnected from how we live today,” Meaney said.\nOn Me’s digital cards also integrate with Apple Pay and Google Wallet.\nImage Credits:On Me\nWith the global gift card market projected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2030, On Me believes it is well-positioned for growth.

    "body": "\nMessaging app Freedom Chat has fixed a pair of security flaws: one that allowed a security researcher to guess registered users’ phone numbers, and another that exposed user-set PINs to others on the app.\nFreedom Chat, released in June, bills itself as a secure messaging app, and claims on its website that users’ phone numbers stay private.\nBut security researcher Eric Daigle told TechCrunch that users’ phone numbers and PIN codes, used for locking the app, could be easily obtained by exploiting vulnerabilities.\nDaigle found the vulnerabilities last week and shared their details with TechCrunch, as Freedom Chat does not provide a public way to report security flaws, like a vulnerability disclosure program. TechCrunch then alerted Freedom Chat founder Tanner Haas to the security flaws by email.\nHaas confirmed to TechCrunch that the app has now reset user PINs and released a new version. Haas added that the company is removing instances where users’ phone numbers were occasionally visible, and has notched up rate-limiting on its servers to prevent mass-guess attempts.\nDaigle, who published his findings in a blog post, told TechCrunch it was possible to enumerate the phone numbers of close to 2,000 users who had signed up to use Freedom Chat since it launched. Daigle said Freedom Chat’s servers allowed anyone to flood it with millions of phone number guesses to determine if a user’s phone number was stored on the servers.\nPer Daigle, this technique is identical to one described by the University of Vienna in research last month, where academics scraped data on some 3.5 billion user accounts who signed up to WhatsApp by matching billions of phone numbers against WhatsApp’s servers.\nDaigle also found Freedom Chat was leaking users’ PIN codes. Using an open-source network traffic inspection tool to analyze the data going in and out of the app, Daigle saw that the app would respond with the PIN codes of every other user in the same public channel — even if the PINs weren’t visible to users within the app itself.\nAccording to Daigle, anyone who was in the default Freedom Chat channel, which users are automatically subscribed to when they first sign up, had their PIN broadcast to everyone else in the channel. Daigle told TechCrunch that knowledge of a person’s PIN could allow someone to open the app from a user’s stolen device.\nIn an app store update published Sunday, Freedom Chat noted: “A critical reset: A recent backend update inadvertently exposed user PINs in a system response. No messages were ever at risk, and because Freedom Chat does not support linked devices, your conversations were never accessible; however, we’ve reset all user PINs to ensure your account stays secure. Your privacy remains our top priority.”\nFreedom Chat is Haas’ second messaging app, after Converso, which was delisted from app stores following the disclosure of security flaws that exposed users’ private messages and content.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch. He also authors the weekly cybersecurity newsletter, this week in security. \nHe can be reached via encrypted message at zackwhittaker.1337 on Signal.

    "body": "\nSpotify may be synonymous with music streaming, but it’s also got a wildly popular developer-tool side-hustle called “Backstage.”  \nBackstage is an open source project that helps companies build their own internal developer portals: a catalog of their developer tools along with quick visualizations of the work the tools have done, and other metrics. But like many open-source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.  \nIsraeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that’s also now been geared to manage AI agents.  \nOn Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company’s $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, announced in May. \nOf all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is where it has the deepest roots. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code. \nBut the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it’s the wild west right now for such devtool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards and so on.\nDevelopers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. \nPort therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer that). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human-in-the-loop, as desired, to approval processes.  \nA feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. \nIn addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving helpdesk tickets and dealing with provisioning. \nEiny describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” \nWith its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.\nThe entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from big tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include LangChain, UiPath, Cortex and more. \n"

Disney is also making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI.\nLaunched in September, Sora allows users to create short videos using simple prompts. With this new agreement, users will be able to draw on more than 200 animated, masked, and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and more.\nThese characters include iconic faces like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Belle, Cinderella, Baymax, and Simba, as well as characters from Encanto, Frozen, Inside Out, Moana, Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Up, and Zootopia. Users will also be able to draw on animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Deadpool, Groot, Iron Man, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Stormtroopers, and more.\nUsers will also be able to draw on these characters while using ChatGPT Images, the feature in ChatGPT that allows users to create visuals using text prompts. \nThe agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices, Disney says. \n“The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement.\nDisney says that alongside the agreement, it will “become a major customer of OpenAI,” as it will use its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, in a statement. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”\nIt’s worth noting that Disney has sued the generative AI platform Midjourney for ignoring requests to stop violating its intellectual property rights. Disney also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Character.AI, urging the chatbot company to remove Disney characters from among the millions of AI companions on its platform.\nDisney’s agreement with OpenAI indicates the company isn’t fully closing the door on AI platforms.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpoor launched in 2021 with the goal of using computer vision to help reduce the impact of wind turbines on local bird populations. Now, the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond.\nOslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera.\nWind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration.\nAsk Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, told TechCrunch last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations.\n“The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn’t have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.”\nHelseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better.\nCourtesy: Spoor\nAt the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.”\nSpoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world’s largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tinto, a London-based mining giant, to track bats.\nThe company has also received interest in using its tech to track other objects of similar size — but Helseth said they aren’t thinking of pivoting into those areas quite yet.\n“Drones are of course a plastic bird in our mind,” Helseth joked. “They move in a different way and have a different shape and size. Currently we are discarding that data but we are getting interest in it.”\nSpoor recently raised an €8 million ($9.3 million) Series A round led by SET Ventures with participation from Ørstead Ventures and Superorganism in addition to strategic investors.\nHelseth predicts that interest in this type of technology will only grow as regulators continue to crack down on wind farms. For example, French regulators shut down a wind farm in April due to its impact on the local bird population and imposed hundreds of millions of fines.\n“Our mission is to enable industry and nature to coexist,” Helseth said. “We have started on that journey, but we are still a small startup with a lot to prove. In the coming years, we want to really cement our position in the wind industry and become a global leader to tackle these challenges. At the same time, we want to build some proof points that this technology has value beyond that main category.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nUp to 3 million abandoned oil and gas wells litter the U.S. alone, and while many still contain oil or natural gas, the owners decided it wasn’t worth it to keep pumping.\n“They’ve tried everything,” Prab Sekhon, CEO of Eclipse Energy, told TechCrunch. “There’s still a ton of oil left behind.”\nEclipse doesn’t have a way to recover that oil, but it does have a way to squeeze some of the energy they embody up to the surface. Rather than pump harder or inject something to force oil to the surface, Eclipse sends down microbes to munch on the oil molecules and liberate their hydrogen. \nInstead of viscous oil, companies only have to deal with hydrogen gas. “Hydrogen flows a lot easier,” Sekhon said, making it easier to extract it from the well.\nThe Houston-based startup, which was spun out of Cemvita, demonstrated the technology at an oilfield in California’s San Joaquin Basin last summer. Now, it’s partnering with oilfield services company Weatherford International to deploy the technology around the world, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The first projects will begin in January.\n“They’re an extension of our team,” Sekhon said to characterize the relationship with Weatherford. “They’ll be our operational arm.”\nEclipse, which was previously known as Gold H2, has been developing the technology over the last several years. It has been sampling microbes that naturally occur in oil wells, which live at the interface between oil and water held in aquifers, to find those that are best suited to the job.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs the microbes consume the oil, they break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both then flow to the surface, where Eclipse and its partners will eventually separate the two. About half of the carbon dioxide is likely to stay in the reservoir, while the other half could be captured using specialized equipment and either sequestered or used.\nThe goal, Sekhon said, is to produce low-carbon hydrogen for around 50 cents per kilogram, or the same price as hydrogen obtained by breaking down natural gas in an industrial plant, a process that releases more carbon dioxide.\nThe resulting hydrogen could be used in petrochemical plants or burned for energy. \n“It’s taking a liability and turning it into a clean energy asset,” Sekhon said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFollowing a couple of months’ testing, Norway-based browser company Opera has finally made its AI-powered browser, Neon, available to the public — though you’ll have to shell out $19.90 per month to use it.\nOpera first unveiled Neon earlier this year in May and launched it in early access to select users in October. \nSimilar to other AI-first browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, OpenAI’s Atlas, and The Browser Company’s Dia, Neon bakes in an AI chatbot into its interface, letting you ask it answers about pages, use it to create mini apps and videos, and get it to do tasks for you. The browser uses your browsing history as context, so you can do things like ask it to fetch details from a YouTube video you watched last week or the post that you read yesterday.\nYou can also build “Cards” for repeatable tasks using prompts, and the browser offers a deep research agent that can get you detailed information about any topic. The browser also has a new tab organizational feature called Tasks, which are contained workspaces of AI chats and tabs. This feature is more like Tab Groups combined with Arc Browser’s Spaces feature, which has its own context for AI.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the AI features, the subscription gives users access to top models like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1, Veo 3.1, and Nano Banana Pro. Subscribers will also get access to Opera’s Discord community and direct access to its developers.\n“Opera Neon is a product for people who like to be the first to the newest AI tech. It’s a rapidly evolving project with significant updates released every week. We’ve been shaping it with our Founders community for a while and are now excited to share the early access to it with a larger audience,” Krystian Kolondra, EVP of browsers at Opera, said in a statement.\nImage Credits: Opera\nThe company noted that its other products, like Opera One, Opera GX, and Opera Air, also have free AI features, like a chat-based assistant.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, browser incumbents are taking a slower approach to adding AI features to their products. Earlier this week, Google detailed the security work it is doing to protect users against different attack surfaces that agentic features are prone to, and Brave said on Wednesday it is previewing its agentic features in a nightly build, and provides an isolated browsing profile for using AI features so users can keep their regular, non-AI usage separate.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI DevOps tool Harness, founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal, is on track to exceed $250 million in annual recurring revenue in 2025, Bansal tells TechCrunch. \nThe startup just raised a fresh $240 million Series E funding that values the company at $5.5 billion post-money. \nThe round includes a $200 million primary investment led by Goldman Sachs and a planned $40 million tender offer with participation from IVP, Menlo Ventures, and Unusual Ventures. The tender offer is intended to provide some liquidity to its long-term employees, Bansal said.\nThe new valuation is a 49% jump from its $3.7 billion valuation in a $230 million round in April 2022. With this funding, the startup has raised $570 million of equity to date.\nAs AI accelerates code production, it is widening a bottleneck in the far larger “after-code” phase of software development — the testing, security checks, and deployment work that still consumes nearly 70% of engineering time. Harness’s tools help automate this sprawling, error-prone layer, even as enterprises grapple with rising AI code volume and the risks of shipping even a single line of faulty software into production systems.\nBansal is well known among developers for building and selling app performance company AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017. So the post-coding world is an area Bansal knows well.\nHarness uses AI agents to automate functions like testing, verification, security, and governance. It is built on a software delivery knowledge graph that maps code changes, services, deployments, tests, environments, incidents, policies, and costs. The knowledge graph helps differentiate Harness from other AI platforms, Bansal said, because it gives the system a deep understanding of each customer’s software delivery processes and architecture.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“This knowledge graph is the context that our AI agents use,” he told TechCrunch.\nThe purpose-built agents draw on that context to generate pipelines that match each customer’s specific policies, architecture and operational requirements.\nHarness also uses an orchestration engine that turns the AI’s recommendations into automated actions, with checks in place to make sure those changes are applied safely.\nImage Credits:Harness\nAs AI is not foolproof, Bansal said the system is designed with human oversight, noting that AI-generated tests or fixes are reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, or auditors before being put into use.\nMicrosoft’s GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and CloudBees are among the key competitors for Harness. But Harness has plenty of traction, claiming more than 1,000 enterprise customers, including United Airlines, Morningstar, Keller Williams and National Australia Bank. So far, the startup has handled 128 million deployments, 81 million builds, protected 1.2 trillion API calls, and helped customers optimize $1.9 billion in cloud spending over the past year, Bansal touts.\nThe San Francisco–based company employs over 1,200 people across 14 offices worldwide, including in Europe and the U.K. Around 33% of its workforce is in India, where it has a large engineering team in Bengaluru and a corporate office in Gurugram. Moreover, the Bengaluru site is Harness’s biggest development center outside the U.S.\nHarness plans to use the new funding to expand its R&D efforts, hire “hundreds of engineers” at its Bengaluru office, and build out additional automated testing, deployment, and security capabilities while improving the accuracy of its AI systems. The company also intends to strengthen its U.S. go-to-market operations and significantly expand its presence in international markets.\nIt should also be noted that earlier this year, Bansal merged his software observability firm Traceable with Harness, and that move has helped the startup grow its ARR projection.\n“We brought the two companies together because we started to see that DevOps and application security are coming together in a very, very deep way,” said Bansal. “We have seen that turned out to be a very, very successful thesis this year … that’s driving a lot of growth for both of our DevOps and application security set of products.”\nWhile this raise has allowed some employees to cash out a bit,  Bansal still plans on taking Harness public one day, he said, though he did not share a specific timeline.\n“That’s what our goals and plans depend on,” he said of an eventual IPO. “Our business is very, very healthy, very strong, high growth and margins, and it will be a great public company when the timing is right.”\n"

    "body": "\nSpotify announced on Wednesday that, for the first time, it’s giving users more control over the streaming service’s algorithm. That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.\nThe feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.\nThe new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.\nThe feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, which debuted last year, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. \nIn addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. \nFor instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.”\nImage Credits:Spotify\nIn another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes.\nThe company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.\nSpotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting users take control of its algorithm. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

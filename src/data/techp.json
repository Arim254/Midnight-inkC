Discovery (WBD) is facing significant new resistance. Investment group Ancora Holdings announced it has purchased $200 million in WBD shares and opposes Netflix’s offer. Instead, Ancora is throwing its support behind a rival bid from Paramount.\nThe WSJ had the exclusive. \n​In a press release on Wednesday, Ancora aligned itself with Paramount’s arguments: It claims the Netflix deal is inferior, involves more regulatory risk, and doesn’t deliver as much immediate cash to shareholders. \n​Just one day earlier, Paramount improved its bid by offering WBD shareholders a new incentive: $0.25 per share for each quarter the deal remains unclosed after December 31, 2026. Additionally, it pledged to cover the $2.8 billion termination fee owed to Netflix if WBD shareholders choose Paramount’s offer.\nAncora stepping in is notable because, while its stake may be relatively small, it’s seeking to rally other shareholders to reject the Netflix proposal. Ancora has warned that if the WBD board refuses to reconsider Paramount’s proposal, it will vote against the Netflix deal and press for board accountability at the company’s 2026 annual meeting. \n​Still, it remains uncertain whether Ancora will be able to sway a significant number of other shareholders. Just last month, WBD reported that more than 93% of shareholders had voted against what the company called Paramount’s less attractive offer, instead favoring the Netflix deal.\n​But if Ancora actually gets a few shareholders to change their minds, the whole Netflix takeover could get flipped on its head. Suddenly, this already tense situation would get even more unpredictable and dramatic.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

    "body": "\nRicha Kaul says she’s a bit of a data privacy nut. At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.” \nSo she launched a company called Complyance to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance. \n“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review. \nThese risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors. \n“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to governance, risk, and compliance.\nOthers in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.\nKaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard. \nThe fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn’t sign up to chase down mundane tasks. \n“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we’re able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.” \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user’s current location. The feed’s arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok’s terms of service under the new U.S. joint venture, which said that the app would begin to collect precise location information from TikTok users.\nToday, TikTok confirms the reason it’s now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.\nThe Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, including the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. \nThe company explains in its announcement that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content’s topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.\nThe new feature also ties into TikTok’s push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many small businesses rely on its services to reach their customers.\nTikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a 2025 Oxford Economics report. The company also highlighted figures from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, which found that 84% of TikTok small business users said the platform helped grow their business, and 75% said TikTok helped them reach customers beyond their local area. In addition, another 74% said TikTok helps them connect with their local community.\nAs TikTok sees it, the Local Feed will help generate real-world traffic and sales for these brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nThe first time users access the Local Feed, they’ll be prompted to allow the app to use their location data. On iOS, for example, the pop-up request will allow users to pick whether they want to allow the activity once or while using the app or not at all. \n“This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,” the company writes in its announcement. However, TikTok would have likely seen a better reception to this feature had it rolled out the request for precise location data before its ownership transition in the U.S., or at least at the same time. That way, the app could at least point to a reason as to why it wanted to collect this additional data.\nStill, even if the location data now has a purpose, it’s worth considering whether or not the value of a local feed is worth the privacy risk. \nTikTok also notes that the feature will be available only to users 18 and older and will only collect information while the app is in use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Joan Cros/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 AM PST · February 11, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nGoogle on Wednesday released the first beta of Android 17, which brings performance improvements and a way to add new features to media and camera apps. Most importantly, it’s changing how developers get access to new APIs and features of the latest version.\nWith this release, the company is ditching developer betas and adopting a continuous Canary channel to push updates for developers. This is similar to how Google approaches web browser development, as Google has a Canary channel for the Chrome browser, too.\nThe company said that because of this approach, features and APIs become available to developers as soon as they are approved in internal testing. Plus, the Canary channel allows for over-the-air updates, benefiting developers with more integrated workflows and better ways to test their apps.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle said it’s targeting March for platform stability, with the planned release of Android 17 in Q2 2026. With Android 16’s release last year, Google adopted a two-release structure in a calendar year, with a major SDK release in the first half and a minor SDK release in the second half of the year. The company made this move to give time to device makers to roll out the latest version more quickly to devices and reduce fragmentation in the Android ecosystem.\nAndroid 17 will restrict developers from opting out of resizing restrictions. This means developers can’t force orientation or resizing on large-screen devices. This is Google’s way of making more apps work better on tablets and foldables in different orientations and window sizes.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding more camera capabilities to Android 17. It’s adding APIs to let developers handle camera transitions more smoothly, support for VVC (H.266) video codec, better handling of loudness across apps to maintain consistent volume, and stricter controls for background audio.\nAndroid 17 also brings performance improvements, decreased missed frames, and a better garbage collection mechanism for memory clean-up. The company is improving Wi-Fi connectivity with better proximity detection and secure peer discovery, as well. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The recipient clicks the link, which preloads the requested payment amount, allowing the transaction to be facilitated quickly.\nCash App says that the links can be used for recurring payments as well as group payments.\nCash App introduced the new feature after surveying Gen Z users and finding that it was common for multiple communications to occur around payments. The links are designed to alleviate any social awkwardness that may accompany those communications while also making payments more direct.\nImage Credits:Cash App\n“Payment links make moving money even more seamless, but just as importantly, they make the task of requesting money feel more human and less awkward,” said Kristen Anderson, P2P & Networks Product Lead at Cash App. “We’ve heard from our customers that sending in-app payment requests and push notifications can sometimes come across as overly formal or even passive-aggressive. Payment links solve this by allowing customers to send requests through whichever platform feels most natural so that they can add context, levity, or humor to the conversation.” \nCash App has added a number of new features lately, including an AI chatbot that debuted late last year and is designed to advise users on their finances, as well as a new benefits program with a high-borrowing limit.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nWhen Sam Blond left his job as a VC for Founders Fund a year ago — just 18 months after he started — he told the world that being a VC wasn’t for him and he was “going back to operating.”  \nOn Wednesday, he officially brought his new startup, Monaco, out of stealth. It was co-founded with his brother Brian Blond, who is also an ex-sales professional turned VC. (Brian is a partner at Human Capital and was formerly at Sutter Hill.) The brothers are joined by two other co-founders, Abishek Viswanathan (previously CPO at Apollo and Qualtrics), and Malay Desai (formerly SVP of engineering at Clari). \nMonaco has raised a total of $35 million, between a $10 million seed and $25 million Series A round, Sam Blond tells TechCrunch. Both rounds were led by Founders Fund, with participation from Human Capital. The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta. \nThe well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta.  \nSo what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work. \nThe startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts. It includes other features, too, like a meeting notetaker. \nThe product is intended to automate much of the sales grunt work. “We can replace full workflows with agents,” Blond says (pictured above, third from left, with brother Brian, pictured second from left). For instance, Monaco builds a database of prospects, identifies the exact people at a target company to pitch, and the sequence in which to target them. “We orchestrate and execute that sequence. We schedule a meeting,” Blond says. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe human-in-the-loop salespeople help ensure that the AI isn’t hallucinating and train it to sell the product, and the actual customer meetings are done by the people. No avatars. \nThat makes Monaco a rare AI sales startup that isn’t talking about human replacement. Instead, it’s making experienced salespeople available to companies too nascent to hire them directly. \n“It’s this combination of the technology, but also the service,” Blond says. “Monaco does not have an agent pretending to be a sales rep trying to sell to the customer.” \nCurrently, Monaco’s main competition is HubSpot, priced as it is to be more affordable for young companies than the big kahuna of the market, Salesforce. Blond declined to tell us what Monaco will charge, except to say that it’s a flat fee and currently discounted while the product remains in beta.  \nHe’s also well aware that he’s in an exceptionally crowded market. Y Combinator alone has graduated hundreds of sales startups in the past couple of years, ranging from AI CRMs to niche AI tools. Then there’s startups like Attio, Clay, and Conversion, and the crop of so-called AI SDR (sales-development representative) tools — human-replacement agentic startups like 11x, Artisan, and 1mind.\nOn top of that, the incumbents, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, and ZoomInfo, are all offering their own AI and agentic tools.  \nBlond points out that today’s top players were built in another era, and none of the upstarts are performing well enough to be a clear-cut winner. \n“There definitely is not the ‘Cursor for sales’,” he says, referring to the popular AI coding tool. “But there will be.” \nHe obviously wants Monaco to be that winner. “In the broad category of sales technology, there’s a market leader right now. That market leader is Salesforce,” Blond says. “We are in the early innings of the next platform shift that will lead to a new market leader.”\nStill, out of all the areas he could have entered after leaving Founders Fund, why duke it out among so much competition?  \nBlond, speaking earnestly, says that having spent his entire career in sales, “As a non-technical founder, there’s really only one type of technology company that I’m qualified to be the founder of: a sales technology company.” \nHe’s clearly having fun doing so. The company employs about 40 people and the office, filled with fellow career salespeople, sports WWII-esque motivational posters on the wall with slogans like “Save Startups” and “Build the future with Monaco.” There’s even an office gong that rings out every time the AI lands a meeting with a prospect. \n"

    "body": "\nJohn Conafay, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, has spent most of his career leading business development at public and private aerospace companies, including Spire, Astranis, and ABL Space Systems.  \nAt each company, Conafay ran into the same software hurdle: Collaborating on government contracts was a logistical mess that forced his teams and their federal counterparts to rely on a tedious back-and-forth of PDFs and Excel files. The bottleneck was always the same — most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.\nSo, in early 2022, Conafay launched Integrate, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a $25 million, five-year contract from the U.S. Space Force.\nThat validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known for early bets on Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.\nUntil recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the U.S. Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.\nThis shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.\n“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Conafay, what sets Integrate apart from its civilian-focused competitors is its ability to let different organizations simultaneously and securely collaborate on massive project schedules while keeping sensitive details hidden from other participants.\nIntegrate is designed to handle the coordination of mammoth, multi-year mega-projects, such as the F-35 Lightning II program or the James Webb Space Telescope, where thousands of partners must stay in sync, Conafay explained.\nWhile he was careful not to reveal too much about customers besides the Space Force, he did say that some of the work the startup is doing for that branch of U.S. military involves deployments of large rockets.\n“They have to coordinate tens of satellites on a single launch across dozens of missions,” Conafay said. “The complexity is pretty extreme, and they use us to coordinate those things.”\nIntegrate intends to grow by selling its software to other branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy, the Army, and the intelligence community, as well as to the private companies that serve them.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nUpScrolled, a social network that caught fire after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S., is facing a serious moderation problem. After growing to more than 2.5 million users in January, users have reported the app is not taking action on the creation of usernames and hashtags that contain racial slurs, and hasn’t been able to properly moderate harmful content.\nAfter receiving tips from UpScrolled users, TechCrunch confirmed the existence of a wide range of racial slurs and hate speech being used in people’s usernames on the app. For instance, some usernames would feature the name of the slur itself, the slur combined with other words, or multiple slurs in a single username; other usernames contain hate speech, like “Glory to Hitler.” \nAfter reporting these slurs to UpScrolled’s public email address, we received a response from that email that the company is “actively reviewing and removing inappropriate content,” and is working to expand its moderation capacity. The email advised us not to engage with bad-faith actors while the situation is resolved.\nDays after reporting this activity on the app, the accounts with slurs in the usernames that were provided to UpScrolled via screenshots remained online. \nIn addition, slurs and hate speech can be found elsewhere in the app, including hashtags and text used alongside its photo or video content, TechCrunch found. Other harmful content was available, including text posts with racial slurs and hate speech, and photo and video content glorifying Hitler, based on TechCrunch’s review of the app.\nTechCrunch wasn’t alone in identifying this problem; the ADL also published a blog post this month, noting that UpScrolled was becoming home to antisemitic and extremist content and designated foreign terrorist organizations, like Hamas and others.\nUpScrolled, which was founded in 2025, claims on its website claims that the platform offers every voice “equal power.” The app has seen more than 4 million downloads on iOS and Android since June 2025, according to market intelligence provider Appfigures — a figure even higher than the startup’s self-reported number last month.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut while UpScrolled’s FAQ explains the app doesn’t “censor opinions,” it does indicate that its policy is to restrict content that involves “illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.”\nThat guidance is similar to most modern-day social media platforms. It’s clear, however, that the company is struggling to enforce its rules.\nIt’s battle that social networks are often faced with — especially those that receive a large influx of new users in a short time period. Bluesky, for instance, faced issues with slurs in account usernames in July 2023, which led to users threatening to leave the site.\nAfter UpScrolled’s initial reply to our inquiry, TechCrunch also received a response from the press account on Tuesday, which directed us to UpScrolled founder Issam Hijazi’s new video, where he addressed the issues with content moderation.\n\nIn the video, he confirmed that users have been uploading “harmful content” that goes against UpScrolled’s terms of service and the company’s beliefs.\n“We are offering everyone the freedom to express and share their opinions in a healthy and respectful digital environment,” Hijazi said. To create that environment, he said the company is “rapidly expanding our content moderation team, and we are upgrading our technology infrastructure so we can catch and remove harmful content more effectively.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThreads is introducing an AI-powered feature that lets users personalize their feed, the Meta-owned social network announced on Wednesday. The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed.\nTo use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear Algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after submitting a request.\nIt’s worth noting that because Dear Algo works through public postings, others are able to see your request, and they can even repost your request to apply it to their own feed. This aspect of the feature may be a hindrance for some users, as they might not want their requests to be public. However, Meta says it views this as a way for users to discover new conversations and topics, turning personalization into a community experience.\nImage Credits:Meta\nBy allowing users to temporarily influence what appears on their feeds, Threads gains an edge over its competitors by offering a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms.\n“Threads is where you go to keep up with what’s happening right now,” the company wrote in a blog post. “But sometimes, what matters to you changes in an instant, and you want your Threads feed to reflect that — whether it’s seeing more posts during a live NBA game or less about a TV show you haven’t caught up on yet.”\nAlthough Threads and its competitors, X and Bluesky, already offer users a simple way to indicate their preferences with a “Not Interested” button, the new Dear Algo feature takes personalization a step further. The feature could also help make Threads feel more real-time, something X has historically been known for.\nDear Algo is available now in the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K. Threads plans to introduce it in more countries in the future. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe launch of the new feature comes a few weeks after a report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggested that Threads now surpasses X in daily mobile usage. Although X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.\nThe report revealed that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on mobile as of January 7, 2026, while X had 125 million daily active users.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nInertia Enterprises has raised $450 million to build one of the world’s most powerful lasers, which it hopes will serve as the foundation of a grid-scale power plant the fusion startup intends to start construction on in 2030. Inertia Enterprises is building on technology developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). The NIF is the site of the world’s only controlled fusion reactions that have reached scientific breakeven, in which the reaction releases more energy than it took to start. \nThe Series A was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from GV, Modern Capital, Threshold Ventures, and others. Inertia’s co-founders include Jeff Lawson, who co-founded Twilio and serves as its CEO; Annie Kritcher, who led the successful experiments at NIF; and Mike Dunne, a Stanford professor who helped Lawrence Livermore develop a power plant design based on NIF. Kritcher has remained in her position at Lawrence Livermore.\nNIF’s breakeven experiments have been a key milestone on the road to widespread fusion power. However, considerable progress needs to be made before a fusion power plant can deliver electricity to the grid. For Inertia, that means building a laser capable of delivering 10 kilojoules 10 times per second.\nThe startup’s reactor relies on a form of fusion known as inertial confinement. In Inertia’s flavor of inertial confinement, lasers bombard a fuel target, compressing the fuel until atoms inside fuse and release energy. The technique is based on NIF’s designs, in which laser light is converted into X-rays inside the target. The X-rays are what ultimately heat and compress the fuel pellet.\nEach of Inertia’s power plants will require 1,000 of its lasers bombarding 4.5 mm targets that cost less than $1 each to mass produce. By contrast, the NIF’s system uses 192 lasers to fire on painstakingly crafted targets that take dozens of hours to make. Inertia is betting that by using the same basic principles as NIF and applying a more commercial mindset, it can bring the costs down dramatically.\nInertia’s new round is the latest in a string of funding announcements from fusion startups in recent months. With this round and others, fusion startups have attracted more than $10 billion in investments. And at least a dozen companies have raised more than $100 million.\nLast week, Avalanche said it had raised $29 million to advance its desktop-sized fusion reactor. Earlier this year, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it had attracted $87 million in investment in advance of a $250 million Series B that it’s currently raising. Last summer, Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised $863 million from dozens of investors, including Google, Nvidia, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTwo fusion companies recently announced they were going public via reverse mergers. General Fusion said in January it would merge with acquisition company Spring Valley III in a deal that values the combined company at $1 billion. General Fusion had previously struggled to raise money from private investors. Earlier last month, TAE Technologies announced it would merge with Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group; the combined company would be worth $6 billion, according to the all-stock transaction.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor 24 years, Microsoft’s Amanda Silver has been working to help developers — and in the last few years, that’s meant building tools for AI. After a long stretch on GitHub Copilot, Silver is now a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, where she works on tools for deploying apps and agentic systems within enterprises. \nHer work is focused on the Foundry system inside Azure, which is designed as a unified AI portal for enterprises, giving her a close view of how companies are actually using these systems and where deployments end up falling short.\nI spoke with Silver about the current capabilities of enterprise agents, and why she believes this is the biggest opportunity for startups since the public cloud.\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.\nSo, your work focuses on Microsoft products for outside developers — often startups that aren’t otherwise focused on AI. How do you see AI impacting those companies?\nI see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm. And I think that that’s an exciting world. \nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWe are certainly seeing multistep agents becoming very broadly used across all different kinds of coding tasks, right? Just as an example, one thing developers have to do to maintain a codebase is stay current with the latest versions of the libraries that it has a dependency on. You might have a dependency on an older version of the dot-net runtime or the Java SDK. And we can have these agentic systems reason over your entire codebase and bring it up to date much more easily, with maybe a 70% or 80% reduction of the time it takes. And it really has to be a deployed multistep agent to do that.\nLive-site operations is another one — if you think of maintaining a website or a service and something goes wrong, there’s a thud in the night, and somebody has to be on call to get woken up to go respond to the incident. We still do have people on call 24/7, just in case the service goes down. But it used to be a really loathed job because you’d get woken up fairly often for these minor incidents. And we’ve now built a genetic system to successfully diagnose and in many cases fully mitigate issues that come up in these live site operations so that humans don’t have to be woken up in the middle of the night and groggily go to their terminals and try to diagnose what’s going on. And that also helps us dramatically reduce the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved.\nOne of the other puzzles of this present moment is that agentic deployments haven’t happened quite as fast as we expected even six months ago. I’m curious why you think that is.\nIf you think about the people who are building agents, what is preventing them from being successful, in many cases, it comes down to not really knowing what the purpose of the agent should be. There’s a culture change that has to happen in how people build these systems. What is the business use case that they are trying to solve for? What are they trying to achieve? You need to be very clear-eyed about what the definition of success is for this agent. And you need to think, what is the data that I’m giving to the agent so that it can reason over how to go accomplish this particular task?\nWe see those things as the bigger stumbling blocks, more than the general uncertainty of letting agents get deployed. Anybody who goes and looks at these systems sees the return on investment.\nYou mention the general uncertainty, which I think feels like a big blocker from the outside. Why do you see it as less of a problem in practice?\nFirst of all, I think that it’s going to be very common that agentic systems have human-in-the-loop scenarios. Think about something like a package return. It used to be that you would have a workflow for the return processing that was 90% automated and 10% human intervention, where somebody would have to go look at the package and have to make a judgment call as to how damaged the package was before they would decide to accept the return. \nThat’s a perfect example where actually now the computer vision models are getting so good that in many cases, we don’t need to have as much human oversight over inspecting the package and making that determination. There will still be some cases that are borderline, where maybe the computer vision is not yet good enough to make a call, and maybe there’s an escalation. It’s kind of like, how often do you need to call in the manager? \nThere are some things that will always need some kind of human oversight, because they’re such critical operations. Think about incurring a contractual legal obligation, or deploying code into a production codebase that could potentially affect the reliability of your systems. But even then, there’s the question of how far we could get in automating the rest of the process.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

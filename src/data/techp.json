The company previously raised a $33 million Series A, which it announced in April 2024.\nThe new round was led by Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize with participation from Alumni Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. Veery Maxwell at Galvanize will be joining the board, as will former Nest CFO Tom vonReichbauer. (The latter should come as no surprise given that many Quilters used to work at Nest.)\nThe new funding will go toward expanding the company’s footprint. Quilt has installed nearly 1,000 units in 16 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, co-founder and CEO Paul Lambert said in a note posted on the company’s website.\nQuilt has been a rare startup challenging entrenched incumbents in the heat pump market. To unseat them, the company has taken a software- and design-first approach. One example is an over-the-air update the company pushed to heat pumps that were already installed; the new software and firmware improved the performance of existing units by more than 20%.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAlumni Ventures, Climate, energy impact partners, Fundraising, Galvanize, Gradient Ventures, heat pumps, In Brief, Incite Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, quilt\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Climate\n"

In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring.\nThat number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too.

Discovery (WBD), days after Warner agreed to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7 billion. \nParamount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share.\nParamount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. \nCNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago.\n“We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. \nParamount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo.\nNetflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNetflix’s proposed deal has already raised antitrust questions, as it would combine two of the most popular streaming platforms into one.

Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. \nThe discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with.\nThe move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content.\nWhile some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms.\nIt’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. \nThe new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlthough a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Meta also has a short-form video feed of AI-generated videos called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others.\nLeading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season.\nDespite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAnthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. \nPreviously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests.\nThe move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work.\nCursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots.\nFor Slack, positioning itself as an “agentic hub” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work.\nBy letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows.\nWhile Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude’s API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”\nTo address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. \nThe feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.\nImage Credits:Hinge\nConvo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. \nThis new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.\nHowever, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. \nHinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nThe former chief engineer of Lucid Motors, Eric Bach, has sued the company for wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation, and claims one of the automaker’s top HR executives referred to him as a “German Nazi.” \nThe federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Northern District of California, claims Bach was stripped of his responsibilities overseeing the powertrain division in early 2025 as a result of an HR investigation into the company’s workplace culture. Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. \nBach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident.  \nTechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. \nBach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. \nHe claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.”\nThe lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLucid has also been churning through executives. The company’s VP of engineering left on the same day Bach claims to have been fired, as TechCrunch previously reported. Former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February, and the company has still not named a permanent replacement. Lucid’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing all left within the last year, too.\nBach, in the complaint, claims to have been ascendant before the internal investigation. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” \nBach states that Lucid’s chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach’s loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose’) and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint.\nThe workplace culture investigation launched in late 2024, which Bach claims was “tainted by HR’s racist beliefs,” “initially resulted in Bach losing significant responsibilities.” The HR department told Bach at the time that he contributed to a poor culture at the company, according to the complaint. In addition to losing oversight of the powertrain team, Bach claims to have been excluded from board meetings.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nTiger Global, the investor that spurred the VC bull market of 2020-2021, is reportedly raising a fresh $2.2 billion fund.\nThe firm sent a letter to potential limited partners, according to a copy obtained by CNBC, seeking to raise the cash for a vehicle called Private Investment Partners 17 (PIP 17). The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness.\nDuring that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.”\nPIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported. \nIn 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups, according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations.\nWhen interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way.\nAfter the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund, and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role, while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, Bloomberg reported at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund.\nNow, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.\nStill, in a nod to the need for more caution than in previous years, the letter promised a more targeted approach. It acknowledged that leaning into AI investments could be risky and require “humility” because “valuations are elevated and, in our view, sometimes unsupported by company fundamentals,” according to CNBC. (Tiger Global could not be immediately reached for comment.)\nIn other words, even as Tiger Global raises a fresh fund to go after more big AI opportunities, it’s implying that the AI market is in a bubble, and it doesn’t want to drive valuations to even higher, perhaps unrealistic, heights.\n"

    "body": "\nLast week, pet products and services giant Petco confirmed that it experienced a data breach involving customers’ personal information, without specifying what type of data was affected.\nOn Friday, in a legally required filing with Texas’ attorney general’s office, Petco reported that the affected data included names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, financial information such as account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, and dates of birth. \nPetco filed similar legally required notices in California, Massachusetts, and Montana. In the latter two states, Petco reported one and three affected residents, respectively. \nThe company did not disclose the exact number of victims in California, where companies are required to disclose breaches involving at least 500 state residents, which suggests there are more victims than that number in the state. \nPetco spokesperson Ventura Olvera did not respond to a series of questions sent on Monday, which included how many customers in total were affected by this incident; whether Petco has any technical means, including logs, to determine whether any cybercriminals had access and stole the customers’ exposed data; what and when was the specific issue identified; and what was the application involved in the incident. \nFor context, in 2022, Petco said it served more than 24 million customers.\nOn Friday, Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCalifornia’s attorney general published a sample letter that Petco is sending to its customers.

    "body": "\nAn increasing number of browsers are experimenting with agentic features that will take actions on your behalf, such as booking tickets or shopping for different items. However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. \nGoogle detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months.\nThe company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.\nImage Credits:Google\nWhat’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.\n“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. \nGoogle is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.\nImage Credits:google\nThe search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. \nAI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released a new open source content detection model to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "description": "ChatGPT Enterprise usage grew 8x year-over-year as workers report saving an hour daily, but OpenAI faces competitive pressure from Anthropic and questions about cost sustainability.",
    "body": "\nOpenAI released new data Monday showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year, with ChatGPT message volume growing 8x since November 2024 and workers reporting they’re saving up to an hour daily. The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google.\nThe timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers.\nThe AI giant has committed $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. \n“If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.”\nOpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value. \nThat increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased energy usage, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nBeyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —  jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.\nThese integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output. \nThe report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams. \nWhile OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to more security vulnerabilities and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher Aardvark, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. \nThe gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysisImage Credits:OpenAI\nOpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible. \nLightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”\n“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”\nOpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

It’s unclear whether he’s bluffing — replacing Anthropic would be a significant undertaking. But the stakes are real: A supply chain risk designation would void Anthropic’s contract and force other Pentagon partners to drop Claude entirely.\n"

The scenario imagines a report from two years in the future, in which unemployment has doubled, and the total value of the stock market has fallen by more than a third. As the report puts it:\n\nAI capabilities improved, companies needed fewer workers, white collar layoffs increased, displaced workers spent less, margin pressure pushed firms to invest more in AI, AI capabilities improved…\nIt was a negative feedback loop with no natural brake…The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth. \n\nIt’s a new kind of bear case, focused not on Skynet-style misalignment but on the gradual unspooling of the economy itself. In particular, the Citrini scenario looks at the implications of integrating AI agents into the economy at large, and what it would mean when outside contractors get replaced by cheaper in-house AI. It’s similar to the Death of SaaS scenario, but Citrini goes further, implicating any business model that involves optimizing transactions between companies.\nAs you might expect, the report is causing quite a stir online. Not everyone is buying it — even Citrini describes it as more of a scenario than a prediction — but it’s not so easy to name the specific point where you think the scenario goes wrong.\nPersonally, I’m not sure companies are ready to hand off purchasing decisions to AI agents, no matter how smart they are. But in Citrini’s scenario, most of the impacted decisions have already been handed off to third-party contractors, so it’s not quite as implausible as it seems.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "body": "\nBrian Merchant, writing for Blood in the Machine, reports that people across the United States are dismantling and destroying Flock surveillance cameras, amid rising public anger that the license plate readers aid U.S. immigration authorities and deportations.\nFlock is the Atlanta-based surveillance startup valued at $7.5 billion a year ago and a maker of license plate readers. It has faced criticism for allowing federal authorities access to its massive network of nationwide license plate readers and databases at a time when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are increasingly relying on data to raid communities as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\nFlock cameras allow authorities to track where people go and when by taking photos of their license plates from thousands of cameras located across the United States. Flock claims it doesn’t share data with ICE directly, but reports show that local police have shared their own access to Flock cameras and its databases with federal authorities.\nWhile some communities are calling on their cities to end their contracts with Flock, others are taking matters into their own hands.\nMerchant reports instances of broken and smashed Flock cameras in La Mesa, California, just weeks after the city council approved the continuation of Flock cameras deployed in the city, despite a clear majority of attendees favoring their shutdown. A local report cited strong opposition to the surveillance technology, with residents raising privacy concerns.\nOther cases of vandalism have stretched from California and Connecticut, to Illinois and Virginia. In Oregon, six license plate scanning cameras on poles were cut down and at least one spray painted. A note left at the base of the severed poles said, “Hahaha get wrecked ya surveilling fucks,” reports Merchant.\nAccording to DeFlock, a project aimed at mapping license plate readers, there are close to 80,000 cameras across the United States. Dozens of cities have so far rejected the use of Flock’s cameras, and some police departments have since blocked federal authorities from using their resources.\nA Flock spokesperson did not say, when reached by TechCrunch, if the company keeps track of how how many cameras have been destroyed since being deployed.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs a product VP at Google Cloud, Michael Gerstenhaber works mostly on Vertex AI, the company’s unified platform for deploying enterprise AI. It gives him a high-level view of how companies are actually using AI models, and what still needs to be done to unleash the potential of agentic AI.\nWhen I spoke with Michael, I was particularly struck by one idea I hadn’t heard before. As he put it, AI models are pushing against three frontiers at once: raw intelligence, response time, and a third quality that has less to do with raw capability than with cost — whether a model can be deployed cheaply enough to run at massive, unpredictable scale. It’s a new way of thinking about model capabilities, and a particularly valuable one for anyone trying to push frontier models in a new direction.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhy don’t you start by walking us through your experience in AI so far, and what you do at Google?\nI’ve been in AI for about two years now. I was at Anthropic for a year and a half, I’ve been at Google almost half a year now. I run Vertex AI, Google’s developer platform. Most of our customers are engineers building their own applications. They want access to agentic patterns. They want access to an agentic platform. They want access to the inference of the smartest models in the world. I provide them that, but I don’t provide the applications themselves. That’s for Shopify, Thomson Reuters, and our various customers to provide in their own domains.\nWhat drew you to Google?\nGoogle is I think unique in the world in that we have everything from the interface to the infrastructure layer. We can build data centers. We can buy electricity and build power plants. We have our own chips. We have our own model. We have the inference layer that we control. We have the agentic layer we control. We have APIs for memory, for interleaved code writing. We have agent engine on top of that that ensures compliance and governance. And then we even have the chat interface with Gemini enterprise and Gemini chat for consumers, right? So part of the reason I came here is because I saw Google as uniquely vertically integrated, and that being a strength for us.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s odd because, even with all the differences between companies, it feels like all three of the big labs are really close in capabilities. Is it just a race for more intelligence, or is it more complicated than that?\nI see three boundaries. Models like Gemini Pro are tuned for raw intelligence. Think about writing code. You just want the best code you can get, doesn’t matter if it takes 45 minutes, because I have to maintain it, I have to put it in production. I just want the best.\nThen there’s this other boundary with latency. If I’m doing customer support and I need to know how to apply a policy, you need intelligence to apply that policy. Are you allowed to transact a return? Can I upgrade my seat on an airplane? But it doesn’t matter how right you are if it took 45 minutes to get the answer. So for those cases, you want the most intelligent product within that latency budget, because more intelligence no longer matters once that person gets bored and hangs up the phone. \nAnd then there’s this last bucket, where somebody like Reddit or Meta wants to moderate the entire internet. They have large budgets, but they can’t take an enterprise risk on something if they don’t know how it scales. They don’t know how many poisonous posts there will be today or tomorrow. So they have to restrict their budget to a model at the highest intelligence they can afford, but in a scalable way to an infinite number of subjects. And for that, cost becomes very, very important.\nOne of the things I’ve been puzzling about is why agentic systems are taking so long to catch on. It feels like the models are there and I’ve seen incredible demos, but we’re not seeing the kind of major changes I would have expected a year ago. What do you think is holding it back?\nThis technology is basically two years old, and there’s still a lot of missing infrastructure. We don’t have patterns for auditing what the agents are doing. We don’t have patterns for authorization of data to an agent. There are these patterns that are going to require work to put into production. And production is always a trailing indicator of what the technology is capable of. So two years isn’t long enough to see what the intelligence supports in production, and that’s where people are struggling.\nI think it’s moved uniquely quickly in software engineering because it fits nicely in the software development lifecycle. We have a dev environment in which it’s safe to break things, and then we promote from the dev environment to the test environment. The process of writing code at Google requires two people to audit that code and both affirm that it’s good enough to put Google’s brand behind and give to our customers. So we have a lot of those human-in-the-loop processes that make the implementation exceptionally low-risk. But we need to produce those patterns in other places and for other professions.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThe challenge of wrangling a deep learning model is often understanding why it does what it does: Whether it’s xAI’s repeated struggle sessions to fine-tune Grok’s odd politics, ChatGPT’s struggles with sycophancy, or run-of-the-mill hallucinations, plumbing through a neural network with billions of parameters isn’t easy.\nGuide Labs, a San Francisco startup founded by CEO Julius Adebayo and chief science officer Aya Abdelsalam Ismail, is offering an answer to that problem today. On Monday, the company open sourced an 8-billion-parameter LLM, Steerling-8B, trained with a new architecture designed to make its actions easily interpretable: Every token produced by the model can be traced back to its origins in the LLM’s training data.\nThat can be as simple as determining the reference materials for facts cited by the model, or as complex as understanding the model’s understanding of humor or gender.\n“If I have a trillion ways to encode gender, and I encode it in 1 billion of the 1 trillion things that I have, you have to make sure you find all those 1 billion things that I’ve encoded, and then you have to be able to reliably turn that on, turn them off,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “You can do it with current models, but it’s very fragile … It’s sort of one of the holy grail questions.”\nAdebayo began this work while earning his PhD at MIT, co-authoring a widely cited 2018 paper that showed existing methods of understanding deep learning models were not reliable. That work ultimately led to the creation of a new way of building LLMs: Developers insert a concept layer in the model that buckets data into traceable categories. This requires more up-front data annotation, but by using other AI models to help, they were able to train this model as their largest proof of concept yet.\n“The kind of interpretability people do is … neuroscience on a model, and we flip that,” Adebayo said. “What we do is actually engineer the model from the ground up so that you don’t need to do neuroscience.”\nImage Credits:Guide Labs\nOne concern with this approach is that it might eliminate some of the emergent behaviors that make LLMs so intriguing: Their ability to generalize in new ways about things they haven’t been trained on yet. Adebayo says that still happens in his company’s model: His team tracks what they call “discovered concepts” that the model discovered on its own, like quantum computing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdebayo argues this interpretable architecture will be something everyone needs. For consumer-facing LLMs, these techniques should allow model builders to do things like block the use of copyrighted materials, or better control outputs around subjects like violence or drug abuse. Regulated industries will require more controllable LLMs — for example, in finance — where a model evaluating loan applicants needs to consider things like financial records but not race. There’s also a need for interpretability in scientific work, another area where Guide Labs has developed technology. Protein folding has been a big success for deep learning models, but scientists need more insight into why their software figured out promising combinations.\n“This model demonstrates that training interpretable models is no longer a sort of science; it’s now an engineering problem,” Adebayo said. “We figured out the science and we can scale them, and there is no reason why this kind of model wouldn’t match the performance of the frontier level models,” which have many more parameters.\nGuide Labs says that Steerling-8B can achieve 90% of the capability of existing models, but uses less training data, thanks to its novel architecture. The next step for the company, which emerged from Y Combinator and raised a $9 million seed round from Initialized Capital in November 2024, is to build a larger model and begin offering API and agentic access to users.\n“The way we’re currently training models is super primitive, and so democratizing inherent interpretability is actually going to be a long-term good thing for our role within the human race,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “As we’re going after these models that are going to be super intelligent, you don’t want something to be making decisions on your behalf that’s sort of mysterious to you.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTim Fernholz is a journalist who writes about technology, finance and public policy.

    "body": "\nFinnish unicorn IQM today announced plans to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), valuing the company at approximately $1.8 billion. The move will see IQM join the growing cohort of quantum computing companies listed on U.S. stock markets. \nFounded in 2018 as a spinout from Finland’s Aalto University and VTT Technical Research, IQM commercializes both on-premises full-stack quantum computers and a cloud platform to access its systems, with clients including academic and industrial labs around the world.\nPublic quantum companies have seen their stocks surge in recent months, fueled by signals from governments and Big Tech that the “quantum advantage” over regular supercomputers may soon be within reach. This has led believers to double down, with the conviction that the field will soon have lucrative real-life applications in life sciences, new materials, and more.\nGoing public will provide IQM with an extended runway to support its commercial plans. The company reported $35 million in 2025 revenue and over $100 million in bookings. With the close of this transaction, its cash position will exceed $450 million. But the company could also see its market cap trend upward or downward, depending on how investor appetite for quantum stocks has evolved when it begins trading.\nWith industrial applications still years away, questions remain as to whether the current quantum frenzy will last. These questions arise to an even greater extent because most of these companies went public via SPACs — a route that is faster than a traditional IPO, but that peaked in 2021 and left many investors nursing losses in its wake.\nDespite this sour aftertaste, quantum SPACs are back in fashion. Earlier this month, neutral-atom quantum company Infleqtion jumped in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) via a SPAC, with Canadian firm Xanadu Quantum Technologies planning to go public via a SPAC on the Nasdaq by the end of March. \nNow, IQM is following in their footsteps but considers entering the public markets on both a U.S. and Nordic exchange. In the U.S., it may go public either on the Nasdaq or on the NYSE — the blank check company, in its case, is a Nasdaq-listed vehicle, Real Asset Acquisition Corp., but as a foreign company, it will list American Depositary Shares, and the listing is subject to approval.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Crunchbase, IQM has raised some $569.1 million to date. Its latest funding round was a $320 million Series B led by U.S. investment firm Ten Eleven Ventures with participation from Finnish investment firm Tesi, Schwarz Group, Winbond Electronics Corporation, EIC, Bayern Kapital, and World Fund.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe creators of Dark Sky, who sold their popular weather app to Apple in March 2020, are back with a new take on weather forecasting. The team recently announced the launch of their new app, Acme Weather, which they claim offers a better and more reliable forecast than the one they had at Dark Sky. The app will also offer a range of unique weather notifications, including fun ones like alerts about rainbows and beautiful sunsets.\nUnlike typical weather apps, Acme Weather’s forecast is supplemented with a range of alternate predictions for better accuracy. \nImage Credits:Acme Weather\nDark Sky co-founder Adam Grossman explains in an introductory blog post that the app’s homegrown forecasts will leverage different numerical weather prediction models, satellite data, ground station observations, and radar data, making its forecast fairly reliable.\nHowever, the app will also feature additional forecast lines that show the other possible outcomes as gray lines on its graphs.\nImage Credits:Acme Weather\n“Forecasts are often wrong — it’s the weather, right? It’s one of the hardest things to predict,” Grossman told TechCrunch via a telephone interview. “And our biggest pet peeve with a lot of weather apps is you just get their best guess, and you don’t know how certain they are.” \nHaving an understanding of the alternatives helps people plan for big events, he noted.\n“I find it most useful for winter storms, where, maybe the storm starts out in the morning, and you’re going to get snow, but maybe there’s also a possibility it holds out a little bit later — to the afternoon — in which case it’s rain,” Gross explained. “Being able to just see that right there on the timeline just gives you this intuitive sense of whether, do all the models agree, and you’re getting snow? Or do half of them say snow and half of them say rain?”,” he says.”\nThis type of weather data could make for a valuable product, not just for consumers, but for other developers, too. \nAt Dark Sky, the team had offered its weather API to developers for a fee. After being acquired by Apple, the team worked on creating WeatherKit, the developer toolkit that provides access to Apple’s weather data on a subscription basis. Grossman said the team hasn’t yet decided if a developer API will be a part of Acme Weather’s offering.\nInstead, Acme Weather is a $25 per year consumer app, with a two-week free trial. This helps to cover the costs involved with pulling in the different weather models and resources, which can be expensive.\n“Most of our time has been spent on building our own forecast — our own data provider, in a way. And this lets us do things like build multiple forecasts…[and] create any map we want, rather than having to rely on a third-party map provider,” Grossman noted.\nAt launch, the app offers a range of maps, like radar, lightning, rain and snow totals, as well as wind, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and hurricane tracks. \nAnother feature, Community Reports, lets users share information about their current conditions to improve the app’s real-time weather reporting. \n\nWhile Dark Sky had become a favorite weather app because of its uncanny ability to predict when it would begin raining in your location, Acme Weather aims to improve on this and even have some fun. \nThe app includes built-in notifications for typical things, like rain, nearby lightning, community reports, government-issued severe weather alerts, and more. It’s also going to experiment with alerts like rainbow predictions or those to identify when you might see a beautiful sunset.\nThese will be available in a special “Acme Labs” section of the app, and Grossman said they’ll be conservative with their predictions, given the difficulty.\nImage Credits:Acme Weather\nUsers will also be able to customize their notifications to focus on weather events they care about, like winds or UV index, or the possibility of rain over the next 24 hours. \nBeing able to try new ideas is part of what drew the team back to building an indie app, Grossman noted.\n“I absolutely love Apple…but as a big company, it’s difficult to try weird, new, experimental ideals. If you have a billion users, mistakes are costly,” he tells TechCrunch. “There’s long software development cycles, there’s a lot of stakeholders, this idea of being able to try a bunch of things, I think, is interesting.”\nAcme Weather is currently available on iOS. An Android version is planned. \nThe team is bootstrapped and includes co-founders Josh Reyes and Dan Abrutyn, also previously of Dark Sky. The small workforce, includes both former Dark Sky team members and new hires.\n"

    "description": "Anthropic accuses DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax of using 24,000 fake accounts to distill Claude’s AI capabilities, as U.S. officials debate export controls aimed at slowing China’s AI progress.",
    "body": "\nAnthropic is accusing three Chinese AI companies of setting up more than 24,000 fake accounts with its Claude AI model to improve their own models.\nThe labs — DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax — allegedly generated more than 16 million exchanges with Claude through those accounts using a technique called “distillation.” Anthropic said the labs “targeted Claude’s most differentiated capabilities: agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding.”\nThe accusations come amid debates over how strictly to enforce export controls on advanced AI chips, a policy aimed at curbing China’s AI development. \nDistillation is a common training method that AI labs use on their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions, but competitors can use it to essentially copy the homework of other labs. OpenAI sent a memo to House lawmakers earlier this month accusing DeepSeek of using distillation to mimic its products. \nDeepSeek first made waves a year ago when it released its open-source R1 reasoning model that nearly matched American frontier labs in performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is expected to soon release DeepSeek V4, its latest model, which reportedly can outperform Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in coding.\nThe scale of each attack differed in scope. Anthropic tracked more than 150,000 exchanges from DeepSeek that seemed aimed at improving foundational logic and alignment, specifically around censor-ship safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries. \nMoonshot AI had more than 3.4 million exchanges targeting agentic reasoning and tool use, coding and data analysis, computer-use agent development, and computer vision. Last month, the firm released a new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMiniMax’s 13 million exchanges targeted agentic coding and tool use and orchestration. Anthropic said it was able to observe MiniMax in action as it redirected nearly half its traffic to siphon capabilities from the latest Claude model when it was launched. \nAnthropic says it will continue to invest in defenses that make distillation attacks harder to execute and easier to identify, but is calling on “a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers.”  \nThe distillation attacks come at a time when American chip exports to China are still hotly debated. Last month, the Trump administration formally allowed U.S. companies like Nvidia to export advanced AI chips (like the H200) to China. Critics have argued that this loosening of export controls increases China’s AI computing capacity at a critical time in the global race for AI dominance.\nAnthropic says that the scale of extraction DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot performed “requires access to advanced chips.”\n“Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,” per Anthropic’s blog. \nDmitri Alperovitch, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think-tank and co-founder of CrowdStrike, told TechCrunch he’s not surprised to see these attacks.\n“It’s been clear for a while now that part of the reason for the rapid progress of Chinese AI models has been theft via distillation of US frontier models. Now we know this for a fact,” Alperovitch said. “This should give us even more compelling reasons to refuse to sell any AI chips to any of these [companies], which would only advantage them further.”\nAnthropic also said distillation doesn’t only threaten to undercut American AI dominance, but could also create national security risks.\n“Anthropic and other U.S. companies build systems that prevent state and non-state actors from using AI to, for example, develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities,” reads Anthropic’s blog post. “Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely.”\nAnthropic pointed to authoritarian governments deploying frontier AI for things like “offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance,” a risk that is multiplied if those models are open-sourced.\nTechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot for comment. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nUber has a pitch for autonomous vehicle makers: we got this.\nThe ride-hailing and food delivery company has launched a new division called Uber Autonomous Solutions designed to take on all the tasks associated with operating a robotaxi, self-driving truck, or sidewalk delivery robot business, including software and support services.\nThe initiative, announced Monday, formalizes what Uber has been not so quietly working on for several years now.\nUber has amassed partnerships with nearly two dozen autonomous vehicle technology companies across every use case from robotaxis and trucking to sidewalk delivery robots and drones. Uber has backed many of these companies — Lucid and Nuro, Waabi, and China’s WeRide — invested $100 million to build fast-charging, autonomous-vehicle charging stations, and even launched Uber AV Labs, a specialized engineering team that will gather data for robotaxi partners. \nUber has made the partnerships and investments; now it wants to make itself indispensable.\n“AV tech teams should be able to focus on what they do best: building software that can safely power an autonomous world,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s global head of autonomous mobility and delivery, who will be leading the initiative. The idea, he said, is to add “operational depth wherever they need it,” including demand generation, rider experience, customer support, or managing the day-to-day fleet operations.\nThe end goal is to help these companies reduce their costs per mile and increase the speed to market. Uber said it plans to help these partners scale robotaxi deployments to more than 15 cities by the end of this year. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“What’s going to determine the success or failure of autonomous in the world is whether it can be commercialized, and Uber is going to be the thing that makes autonomy commercially viable,” Uber President and COO Andrew MacDonald said. \nFor Uber that means handling infrastructure like training data and mapping, fleet financing, regulatory services, and managing how robotaxis and other AVs navigate complex events and venues. The company said it is using a fleet of specially equipped Lucid vehicles to collect data that can be shared with partners so they can train their AI systems.\nThe new division also plans to tackle user experience including customer support. Notably, Uber wants to take over fleet management, which would include remote assistance — an issue that recently received attention from federal lawmakers over concerns Waymo uses workers overseas. Fleet management would also cover insurance and employing the humans who might need to support these AVs when they’re out in the world.\nUber’s move is both existential and opportunistic. The company sold its in-house AV development unit known as Uber ATG in 2020, following two years of internal struggles and pressure after one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian. (Uber sold off the division in a complex deal with Aurora.) \nIt has tried to shore up its position through partnerships and investments. And there have been plenty. Uber and Waymo have a shared robotaxi service in Atlanta and Austin. The company has also locked up partnerships with Chinese firms Baidu, Momenta, and Pony.ai, sidewalk delivery bot companies Cartken, Starship, Serve, and the UK-based automated driving tech startup Wayve, as well as robotaxi developers AVride and Motional, to name a few. It has plans to launch a robotaxi service with Volkswagen in Los Angeles by the end of 2026 — although it won’t be driverless until 2027.\nThese do provide Uber with some protection, but it doesn’t provide a replacement to any revenue lost if these companies erode its own ride-hailing and food delivery business that is today powered by human drivers. Uber is hoping this new division will. \n\nLoading the player…\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nOpenAI is beefing up partnerships with four major consulting giants as the AI company looks to grow its enterprise business in 2026.\nOpenAI announced on Monday the “Frontier Alliance,” a signal that the AI lab is willing to try different approaches to get enterprises to meaningfully adopt its technology. The alliance includes multi-year partnerships between OpenAI and four major consulting firms, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, Accenture and Capgemini, to sell its enterprise products.\nOpenAI’s Forward Deployed Engineering team will work with the consulting giants to help them implement OpenAI’s enterprise-focused technologies like OpenAI Frontier into customers’ tech stacks.\nThe company launched OpenAI Frontier in early February. The no-code open software allows users to build, deploy, and manage AI agents both built on OpenAI’s AI models and beyond.\nOpenAI argues in its latest announcement that consultants are the right avenue to get enterprises on board.\n“AI alone does not drive transformation. It must be linked to strategy, built into redesigned processes, and adopted at scale with aligned incentives and culture to deliver sustained outcomes,” BCG CEO Christoph Schweizer said in OpenAI’s blog post. “Our expanded partnership combines OpenAI’s Frontier platform with BCG’s deep industry, functional, and tech expertise and BCG X’s build-and-scale capabilities to drive measurable impact with safeguards from day one.”\nThus far, enterprise adoption of AI has been relatively slow as these companies struggle to find a meaningful return on investment from their AI pursuits.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpenAI’s alliance strategy makes sense and goes beyond just pitching enterprises on attaching AI to their existing workflows. Instead, this effort focuses on consultants persuading companies to change their strategies and workflows to fold in OpenAI’s tools where it makes sense. \nIt’s worth noting the OpenAI rival Anthropic has inked deals with consulting giants including Deloitte and Accenture in recent months too.\nCompany CFO Sarah Friar wrote in a blog post in January that enterprise is a big area of focus for OpenAI in 2026. OpenAI has also inked sizable enterprise AI deals with Snowflake and ServiceNow so far this year, in addition to naming Barret Zoph to lead the company’s enterprise sales effort in January.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The company released its app for Mac and Windows first, then launched on iOS in June 2025.\nOn iOS, users could use Wispr Flow through a dedicated keyboard. On Android, the interface is a bit different, as you can access the dictionary through a floating bubble. You can hold the bubble and dictate, or press once to start, and then press the close button to stop the process. Just like on other platforms, in addition to dictation, the app cleans up the filter words and also formats the text based on the context of the app and spoken content.\n“Android finally gave us the freedom to build the voice experience we always wanted. Only when the platform gets out of the way can we truly expect voice to replace typing on mobile,” Tanay Kothari, co-founder and CEO of the startup, said. \nThe app can support translation in over 100 languages and can work across other apps. Along with the Android app release, Wispr Flow said that it has done an infrastructure rewrite that makes dictation 30% faster than before. \n\nLoading the player…\n\nWhile there are tons of AI-powered dictation apps available on desktop and iOS, Wispr Flow is one of the few available on Android with this launch, besides Typeless, which launched an app for the platform last month.\nWhat’s more, the company has also released a new model for Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, for people in India who speak in mix-coded way. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“If you’re someone like me, English and Hindi weave together when I’m chatting with family and colleagues back home.

    "body": "\nAfter initially testing its AI-powered “Prompted Playlist” feature in New Zealand and recently launching in the U.S. and Canada, Spotify announced on Monday that it’s rolling out the tool to Premium subscribers in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and Sweden.\nThe Prompted Playlist feature allows users to create custom playlists by simply describing what they want to listen to in their own words. Instead of searching for individual songs or artists, users can describe the vibe, scenario, or inspiration they want, and Spotify will take care of the rest.\nTo access the feature, users tap “Create” and then select “Prompted Playlist,” then enter any prompt in English. The feature is designed to interpret themes including moods, aesthetics, and even memories. Prompts can be as broad or specific as the user wants, referencing musical eras, genres, activities, lyrics, instruments, or even requesting a playlist inspired by a TV show, movie, or personal milestone. Users can also specify whether they want the playlist to include mostly new music or just music from their library in the prompt. \nOnce a prompt is submitted, Spotify’s AI generates a customized playlist tailored to the request. The system draws on the user’s listening history and incorporates current music and cultural trends. Plus, each song comes with a short explanation that offers insight into why it was chosen for that particular playlist.\nUsers can refine their playlists by adjusting their prompts or starting over. For those whose musical tastes constantly evolve, playlists can be scheduled to automatically refresh on a daily or weekly basis.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nBecause this is still in beta, Spotify noted that there might be changes as the company gets feedback, and that there are currently usage limits in place. Some users have reported hitting limits after roughly 20 or 30 prompts.\nSpotify has recently expanded AI features throughout its platform, including Page Match, which lets users scan a physical book page to jump to the corresponding spot in the audiobook, and About the Song. The platform also updated its song lyrics feature to provide global translations and offline access. Last week, SeatGeek partnered with Spotify to help listeners easily find ticket links for concerts on an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates within the app. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInternally, the company has implemented AI throughout its workflows, with co-CEO Gustav Söderström saying earlier this month that Spotify’s best developers haven’t written a line of code since December, thanks to AI. \nSpotify is also expanding its audiobook business by venturing into physical book sales.

The backdoor allowed the hackers to gain access to 119 other unnamed organizations that used the company’s same VPN product.\nMandiant was reportedly aware of the breaches as well, alerting Ivanti that hackers had exploited the bug to breach European and U.S. military contractors. \nThe previously unreported breach is the latest example of how acquisitions, layoffs, and cost-cutting driven by private equity firms helped to compromise the quality and security of Ivanti’s most critical technologies. After private investment giant Clearlake Capital Group acquired Ivanti in 2017, Bloomberg reported rounds of cuts — particularly in 2022 — affecting employees who had deep institutional knowledge of the company’s products and their security.\nIvanti’s spokesperson Carrie Laudie disputed Bloomberg’s reporting and said there was “never a backdoor planted by hackers in Connect Secure.” \nMandiant did not respond to a request for comment. \nBloomberg’s findings echo earlier reporting into rival provider of remote access tools, Citrix, which had large-scale layoffs following a 2022 deal by Elliott Investment Management and Vista Equity Partners to buy the company.

    "body": "\nPresident Donald Trump said in a social media post Saturday that Netflix will “pay the consequences” if it doesn’t fire Susan Rice, who has served on the company’s board of directors since 2018.\nTrump’s comments came after Rice — a former ambassador to the United Nations who held diplomatic and advisory roles in the Obama and Biden administrations — appeared on the “Stay Tuned with Preet” podcast hosted by Preet Bharara and predicted that corporations that “take a knee” to Trump will be “held accountable” when Democrats return to power.\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and […] say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted,’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\nIn response, Trump posted on his social network Truth Social, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???”\nTrump’s post also includes a screenshot of a post from far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Rice’s comments and claiming, “The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in” due to the deal between Netflix and the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground.\nWhile Trump’s post does not mention specific consequences, Netflix’s massive Warner Bros. acquisition will need to be approved by federal regulators.

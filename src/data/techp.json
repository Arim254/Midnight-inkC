If the company attracts investors at the top of that range it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion.\nThe Vermont-based company, which was founded in 2017 by its enigmatic CEO Kyle Clark, filed the paperwork Wednesday despite the government shutdown. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that allows companies in IPO limbo to allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nClark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, has not followed the typical path of a startup founder. He eschewed Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and took a different path to raising funds to develop and build electric aircraft. Beta has never taken venture capital, instead raising $1.15 billion in funds from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority.\nLast month, Beta Technologies announced a strategic deal with GE Aerospace to build a hybrid-electric turbogenerator for next-gen aircraft. GE Aerospace agreed to take a stake in the company and invest $300 million as part of the deal.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

    "body": "\nSpotify on Wednesday upgraded its AI DJ feature — available to Premium subscribers — with a handful of new features, including the ability to send in your requests by typing, not just using voice commands. \nThe feature works with both English and Spanish requests, as Spotify’s Spanish-language DJ, called DJ Livi, now accepts music requests. \nThe AI DJ feature was updated earlier this year to accept voice requests, instead of only playing tunes Spotify thinks that you’ll like. However, that feature was only available to the English-language AI DJ until today.\nTexting with an AI assistant is now a common behavior, thanks to the rising popularity of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini. These services allow for multi-modal inputs, meaning you can either talk, text, or upload images and files as part of your request. As more people have gotten used to shifting back and forth between input methods, Apple rolled out a version of its Siri assistant that can also be reached by text.\nIt’s a natural next step for Spotify’s AI feature to accept text input, as well, given that users are often engaged with the streaming service when out and about, commuting, or in a quiet space where they don’t want to disturb others by issuing voice commands. \nIn addition to the new texting feature, Spotify says that the AI DJ will also now offer personalized prompt suggestions to help inspire you if you’re not sure what you want to listen to next. \nTo access the DJ, you simply search for the term “DJ” on Spotify and then press play to start your curated selection of music. If you want to change the music, you can tap the DJ button in the bottom-right of the screen, then offer your suggestion via voice or text. \nSpotify notes the DJ can handle requests that combine genre, mood, artist, or activity. The feature is currently live in English and Spanish in over 60 markets worldwide.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

In the company’s testing, Haiku scored 73% on SWE-Bench verified and 41% on the command-line-focused Terminal-Bench — below Sonnet 4.5, but on par with Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 in each case. Tests show similar results on benchmarks for tool use, computer use, and visual reasoning.\nThe new version of Haiku will be immediately available under all free Anthropic plans and the company believes it will be particularly appealing for free versions of AI products, where it can provide significant capabilities while minimizing server loads. The lightweight nature of the model also means it’s easier to deploy multiple Haiku agents in parallel or in combination with a more sophisticated model.\nIn a statement to press, Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said the Haiku would make new styles of deployment possible in production for the first time. “It’s opening up entirely new categories of what’s possible with AI in production environments – with Sonnet handling complex planning while Haiku-powered sub-agents execute at speed,” Krieger said. “We’re giving people a complete agent toolbox where each model has the right combination of intelligence, speed, and cost for different parts of the job.” \nThe most immediate applications are likely to come in software development tools, where Claude Code is already commonly used and latency is often a critical factor. In statements provided by Anthropic, Zencoder CEO Andrew Filev described the new version of Haiku as “unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.” \nHaiku 4.5 comes after a string of high-profile launches for Anthropic: just two weeks after the launch of Sonnet 4.5 and two months after the launch of Opus 4.1, both of which were hailed as state-of-the-art on release. The previous version of Haiku was released in October 2024.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nApple announced Tuesday that it had signed contracts for 650 megawatts of renewable power in Europe.\nThis includes wind and solar projects that are either operational or will be soon. A large chunk of the power they’ll produce will go toward offsetting the energy used by Apple customers. Use of everything from Mac Pros to Apple Watches accounts for nearly one-third of the company’s carbon footprint.\nEven though Europe isn’t usually considered a sunny continent, Apple is buying energy from several solar farms, including 110 megawatts each in Greece and Latvia, 131 megawatts in Spain, and 40 megawatts in Poland. Wind farms will contribute 99 megawatts in Romania and a portion of the 129 megawatt solar-wind portfolio in Italy.\nSeparately, Apple also said it would invest $150 million in China to help its suppliers switch to renewable energy. Already, renewable sources power more than 90% of the company’s manufacturing and production in the country.\nPerhaps most notable about these announcements is that they appear in the newsrooms of Apple’s regional websites, but not in the feed of its U.S. press site. Previously, the company’s press releases on regional renewable power purchases have appeared in that feed, perhaps out of a desire to not draw the ire of the Trump administration, which has been antagonistic to renewables.\nStill, solar and wind — and increasingly grid-scale batteries — have been the go-to source of energy for tech companies looking to power their operations.\nMicrosoft and Meta have also been consistent buyers of solar in particular. This year alone, Meta has added over 2 gigawatts of solar capacity, and Microsoft has signed deals that raise its total by 1.5 gigawatts.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile most big tech firms have pledged to move to renewable power, more practical considerations help drive such deals. Solar and wind are among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, undercutting coal and natural gas. When paired with batteries, which continue to drop in cost, they can provide firm, 24/7 power.\nThe other reason is speed: Solar farms can be built quickly, with a typical project requiring just 18 months to complete. What’s more, they can be completed in phases, allowing part of the project to come online early. For tech companies, which are in a race to secure power for their data centers and AI operations, that speed can make a significant difference. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs AI makes it easier to create bots that act ever more human-like, Elon Musk’s X is developing a new feature that would expose more information about the users behind an X profile in an effort to help people better understand who they’re talking to on the platform.\nAccording to a new post by X’s head of product Nikita Bier, the social network will begin experimenting with displaying more information on user profiles, including details such as the date the account was created, its location, the number of username changes it has undergone, and how it’s utilizing X’s service.\n\nWhen you read content on X, you should be able to verify its authenticity. This is critical to getting a pulse on important issues happening in the world.As part of that, we're experimenting with displaying new information on profiles, including which country an account is… pic.twitter.com/OYgT1OiJdA— Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) October 14, 2025\n\nThe idea is that by exposing some of these details, users will be able to make a more informed decision about whether someone is operating an authentic account or if they’re possibly a bot or bad actor attempting to sow misinformation. \nFor instance, if an account’s bio claims they’re based in a U.S. state, but their account information shows it’s based overseas, you may suspect the account has another agenda.\nSimilarly, if it shows they’ve downloaded the X app in an international app store, but pretend they’re from the U.S., you may also question their legitimacy. (That’s not to say that someone couldn’t have started an account elsewhere and then relocated to the U.S., but it’s a signal that could be combined with others — like multiple username changes, perhaps — that could raise red flags.) \nBier said that X will begin testing the feature first on some X employee profiles next week to get feedback before rolling it out more broadly. He also noted in a response to a question about user privacy that people would be able to opt out of having this information displayed. However, he pointed out, “if a user configures [the privacy toggles], that will likely be highlighted on their profile.” \nHe also addressed concerns over exposing people’s location, given that there are some areas where speech could have penalties, saying that X may substitute region for country in those cases. \nThe idea of displaying more information about a social media account to help users understand who they may be engaged with on social media is not new. In a recent interview at Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, for instance, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that users on the photo- and video-sharing app today could visit someone’s profile and see a similar set of information.\n“Today, if you go to my profile, you can go to ‘About this profile,’ and you can see how long I’ve had this profile, what country I’m based in, how many times I’ve changed my username — a series of signals that you can use to decide how much you want to trust or not trust,” he said, noting that Instagram may “do more” to provide additional context in the future. \nThe changes on X, if they roll out publicly, could help address issues around trust to some extent, though scammers and spammers often have effective ways of working around attempts at exposure.\nThe news follows a recent bot purge on X, where the company removed 1.7 million bots engaging in reply spam.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSemiconductor design company Arm is partnering up with Meta to enhance the social media giant’s AI systems amid an unprecedented infrastructure buildout. Under the partnership, Meta’s ranking and recommendation systems will move to Arm’s Neoverse platform, which was recently optimized for AI systems in the cloud, among other implementations.\n“AI is transforming how people connect and create,” Santosh Janardhan, Meta’s head of infrastructure, said in a statement. “Partnering with Arm enables us to efficiently scale that innovation to the more than 3 billion people who use Meta’s apps and technologies.”\nBest known for its mobile CPU architecture, Arm’s GPU offerings have often been overshadowed by competitors like Nvidia. But Arm is now emphasizing its advantage in low-power deployments.\n“AI’s next era will be defined by delivering efficiency at scale,” Rene Haas, Arm’s CEO, said in a statement. “Partnering with Meta, we’re uniting Arm’s performance-per-watt leadership with Meta’s AI innovation.”\nThe multi-year partnership comes as Meta invests in vastly expanding its data center network to keep pace with anticipated demand for AI services. One project, code-named “Prometheus,” is expected to come online with multiple gigawatts of power in 2027. Construction is currently underway in New Albany, Ohio, and a 200-megawatt natural gas project is being constructed to directly serve the project’s power needs.\nMeta is also building a data center campus, code-named “Hyperion,” across 2,250 acres in northwest Louisiana that’s meant to deliver 5 gigawatts of computational power when complete. Construction is expected to continue through 2030, although some portions may come online before then.\nCrucially, Arm and Meta are not exchanging ownership stakes or significant physical infrastructure, setting this partnership apart from a number of recent AI infrastructure deals. Nvidia has been particularly aggressive with its investments — it recently committed to a $100 billion phased investment into OpenAI, as well as billion-dollar investments into Elon Musk’s xAI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, and French AI lab Mistral.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA rival to both Nvidia and Arm, AMD recently committed to supplying OpenAI with 6 gigawatts’ worth of compute capacity.

    "body": "\nAI hyperscaler startup Nscale has signed a sizable deal with Microsoft to bring Nvidia AI hardware to multiple data centers.\nThe AI cloud provider announced on Wednesday that it signed a deal with Microsoft to bring approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.\nThese GPUs will be delivered through Nscale-owned operations and through a joint venture with investment company Aker, one of Nscale’s investors.\nAbout half of these GPUs, 104,000, will head to a data center in Texas leased by Ionic Digital, over the next 12 to 18 months. Nscale plans to increase its footprint at this location to 1.2 gigawatts, the company stated.\nNscale will also deploy 12,600 GPUs to the Start Campus data center in Sines, Portugal, starting in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe deal builds on previous plans with both Microsoft and Aker regarding data centers in Norway and the United Kingdom. Nscale will send 23,000 GPUS to its Loughton, England campus starting in 2027, and send the remaining 52,000 GPUs to Microsoft’s AI campus in Narvik, Norway.\n“This agreement confirms Nscale’s place as a partner of choice for the world’s most important technology leaders,” Josh Payne, founder and CEO of Nscale, said in a company press release. “Few companies are equipped to deliver GPU deployments at this scale, but we have the experience and have built the global pipeline to do so.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s a bold claim by Payne, considering that Nscale was founded in 2024. Since its launch, the company has raised more than $1.7 billion from strategic partners including Aker, Nokia and Nvidia. Nscale has also raised from investors like Sandton Capital Partners, G Squared and Point72, among others. Payne told the Financial Times that the company is looking at an IPO as early as the end of next year.\n“The pace with which we have expanded our capacity demonstrates both our readiness and our commitment to efficiency, sustainability and providing our customers with the most advanced technology available. It’s a clear signal that Nscale is setting a new standard for how the next wave of AI infrastructure will be delivered,” Payne said in the release.\nGPU deals have picked up in recent weeks. OpenAI announced it was purchasing six gigawatts’ worth of chips from AMD last week. OpenAI also recently inked a deal with Nvidia in which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in the company in exchange for 10 gigawatts’ worth of chips in September.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

When you are locked out of your account because you lost your device or forgot your password. This setting is under the security tab on your Google Accounts page.\nImage Credits:Google\nWhen you are locked out, you can select a recovery contact as the backup method, and they will get a number, which will be valid for 15 minutes, that you will have to verify to log in to your account again. You can add 10 recovery contacts to your account, and they will have to approve your request to be added as one. Once you add a recovery contact, you can’t use them again for seven days.\nThe company is also adding sign-in with mobile number as a recovery method, which is particularly helpful when you lose a device. The tool automatically identifies all accounts linked with a particular phone number. You can use your lock-screen passcode or pattern from the previous device to verify yourself. This feature is gradually rolling out worldwide.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe company launched on-device protection for messages for Pixel devices to detect scam and spam messages. Google is now baking in spam link detection in Google Messages for all users. When you click on a suspicious message, the app will warn you and stop you from visiting that page.\nImage Credits:Google\nFor more technically inclined people, the company is adding a key verifier in Google Messages.

    "body": "\nCybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company’s source code and customer information.\nIn a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.\nThe Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and publicly undisclosed security vulnerabilities.\nF5 said it wasn’t aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.\nThe company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers’ systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers’ systems.\nF5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”\nF5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.\nThe U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5’s disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”\nCISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.\nThe company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions beyond the company’s published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. \nF5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhile employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.\nAshutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twin startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.\nOn Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.\nViven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person’s digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.\n“When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you’re talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.\nOne major hurdle is that people just can’t share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive  information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.\nAccording to Ashutosh Garg, Viven’s technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup’s LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nViven’s LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private — like questions related to an employee’s personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.\n“It’s a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,” Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.\nViven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)\nAs for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.\nHe wasn’t sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.\nAshu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.\n“When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there’s this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.\nBut just because there are no direct competitors now doesn’t mean that other companies won’t build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI’s enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its “pairwise” context technology will be its moat.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify has been spotted developing a “SongDNA” feature that would allow users to discover music through the credits — the writers, collaborators, vocalists, engineers, lyricists, producers, composers, and others who worked on a given track or album.\nThe feature was discovered in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who was able to generate screenshots of how SongDNA would appear in the app. Based on her findings, SongDNA would introduce a visual experience where you could essentially navigate through the credits, see how people were connected to each other, and explore their various works.\n\nFor instance, Wong showed how one artist, Rei Ami from the “KPop Demon Hunters” cast, had lent her voice to other tracks beyond those from the movie.\nIf Spotify releases the feature to the public, it could challenge the streaming service TIDAL’s interactive credits, which also lets you explore music through the contributors behind the songs you love. The addition could be useful for music industry pros looking for collaborators, as well as anyone wanting to learn more about the people who work behind the scenes in music creation.\nShortly after posting screenshots to social media, Wong said Spotify’s app was updated to remove references to the SongDNA feature. Reached for comment, Spotify declined to share further details but did not issue a denial.\nFollowing Wong’s post, another reverse engineer and technologist, Chris Messina, was able to confirm SongDNA’s existence by finding references to the feature within the app’s code. According to Messina, the lines of code suggest the feature could be used to reveal the network of contributors behind songs, allowing users to explore more of their work, he said.\nImage Credits:Chris Messina via Threads (opens in a new window)\nWhile some wondered if SongDNA would be Spotify’s answer to Pandora’s Music Genome Project, it appears that’s not quite the case. The Genome Project uses hundreds of different details, or “traits,” corresponding to a particular characteristic of the music to classify tracks and determine how they’re related.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSongDNA, for now at least, appears to be more focused on just the people behind the music, not the music itself. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

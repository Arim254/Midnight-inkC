Australia has already passed a law that will come into force on December 10, mandating social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16.\nFrance, Denmark, Italy, and Norway are working on similar age-restriction measures for social media platforms, and in the U.S., 24 states have so far enacted age-verification laws. Utah became the first U.S. state to require app stores to verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for minors downloading apps.\nThe U.K.’s Online Safety Act also came into effect in July, mandating social media and other online platforms to block children’s access to harmful content or face huge fines. The U.K. requires strong age checks for high-risk content, like self-harm and eating-disorder content, to protect users under 18.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n"

According to reporting from the Financial Times, we’re about to find out.\nMajor insurers including Great American, Chubb, and W. R. Berkley are asking U.S. regulators for permission to exclude widespread AI-related liabilities from corporate policies. One underwriter describes the AI models’ outputs to the FT as “too much of a black box.”\nAIG, also listed in the FT story, has since sent TechCrunch the following statement: “AIG was not specifically seeking to use these [reported upon] exclusions and has no plans to implement them at this time.”\nThe industry has good reason to be spooked, the story reminds us. Google’s AI Overview falsely accused a solar company of legal troubles, triggering a $110 million lawsuit back in March. Air Canada last year got stuck honoring a discount its chatbot invented. And fraudsters last year used a digitally cloned version of a senior executive to steal $25 million from the London-based design engineering firm Arup during a video call that seemed entirely real.\nWhat really terrifies insurers isn’t one massive payout; it’s the systemic risk of thousands of simultaneous claims when a widely used AI model steps in it. As one Aon executive put it, insurers can handle a $400 million loss to one company. What they can’t handle is an agentic AI mishap that triggers 10,000 losses at once.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

Bier acknowledged that the “data was not 100% for old accounts” and suggested that “a few rough edges … will be resolved by Tuesday.”\nThe Verge noted that while there are definitely rage-bait accounts and troll farms located outside the U.S., many of the listed locations seem highly questionable, with the confusion likely due to travel, global teams, VPNs, or old IP addresses.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n"

States with contested AI laws would also reportedly be threatened with the loss of federal broadband funding.\nNow, Reuters reports that the executive order has been put on hold. If signed, the order would probably face significant opposition, including from Republicans who previously criticized the proposed moratorium on state regulation.\nAI regulation has also been a controversial topic in Silicon Valley, with some industry figures — especially those in the Trump administration — attacking companies like Anthropic for supporting AI safety bills including California’s SB 53.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services.\nThe project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company.\nAWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026.\n“Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”\nAWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.\nThe entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.\nOpenAI launched a version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies in January.

    "body": "\nOn Monday, Anthropic announced Opus 4.5, the latest version of its flagship model. It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October.\nAs expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas) and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). \nNotably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80 percent on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark.\nAnthropic also emphasized the Opus’s computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team and Enterprise users.\nOpus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. \n“There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.”\nThose changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany of the upgrades are made with an eye towards agentic use-cases, particularly scenarios in which Opus acts as a lead agent commanding a group of Haiku-powered sub-agents. Managing those tasks requires a strong command of working memory, which is where the memory improvements described by Penn really show their worth.\n“This is where fundamentals like memory become really important,” Penn says, “because Claude needs to be able to explore code bases and large documents, and also know when to backtrack and recheck something.”\nOpus 4.5 will face stiff competition from other recently released frontier models, most notably OpenAI’s GPT 5.1 (released on November 12) and Google’s Gemini 3 (released November 18).\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration has disbanded the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a controversial team of federal cost-cutters previously led by Elon Musk, despite months left of the unit’s mandate.\nReuters first reported this weekend that DOGE had broken up, ending the months-long effort by Musk and his associates — many recruited from his various private-sector companies — to reduce alleged fraud and waste and cut employees across the federal government. DOGE was created by an executive order signed by President Trump in January. The initiative was expected to run for close to two years.\nAs of early November, DOGE “doesn’t exist,” according to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources department.\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Kupor said that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.”\nAmy Gleason, who was named as the “official” acting administrator of DOGE earlier this year, posted on LinkedIn soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.”\nWhile active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. \nDOGE’s cuts have also been blamed for countless deaths across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.\nMusk departed DOGE earlier this year after a public falling out with President Trump.\nAccording to Politico, several DOGE staffers are said to be fearful that they could face future federal charges without protections from Musk, who might have been able to secure presidential pardons for them if necessary.\nSeveral DOGE staffers are now working for other U.S. federal government departments, according to Reuters, while other prominent DOGE staffers have said they no longer work for the government. Edward Coristine, whose nickname “Big Balls” went viral, said in a post on X in June that he is “officially out” of DOGE.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNuclear startup X-energy raised $700 million in a Series D found, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe new fundraise comes less than a year after it expanded its Series C from $500 million to $700 million, bringing the total raised in the last year or so to $1.4 billion, a sizable amount even in the heady world of nuclear power startups. X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date.\nX-energy said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica.\nThe new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures.\nX-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity.\nLike other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers.\nAmazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led the first installment of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy more than 600 megawatts of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon’s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nX-energy is in a race with several other SMR startups to resuscitate the nuclear industry in the United States.

    "body": "\nSeveral U.S. banking giants and mortgage lenders are reportedly scrambling to assess how much of their customers’ data was stolen during a cyberattack on a New York financial technology company earlier this month.\nSitusAMC, which provides technology for over a thousand commercial and real estate financiers, confirmed in a statement over the weekend that it had identified a data breach on November 12.\nThe company said that unspecified hackers had stolen corporate data associated with its banking customers’ relationship with SitusAMC, as well as “accounting records and legal agreements” during the cyberattack. \nThe statement added that the scope and nature of the cyberattack “remains under investigation.” SitusAMC said that the incident is “now contained,” and that its systems are operational. The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company’s systems rather than causing destruction.\nAccording to Bloomberg and CNN, citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website.\nIt’s unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers. \nAccording to SitusAMC’s website, the company processes billions of documents related to loans annually. \nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Citi spokesperson Patricia Tuma declined to comment on the breach. Tuma would not say if the bank has received any communications from the hackers, such as a demand for money.\nRepresentatives for JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. SitusAMC chief executive Michael Franco also did not respond to our email when contacted for comment Monday.\nA spokesperson for the FBI told TechCrunch that the bureau is aware of the breach.\n“While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services,” said FBI director Kash Patel in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We remain committed to identifying those responsible and safeguarding the security of our critical infrastructure.”\nDo you know more about the SitusAMC data breach?

    "body": "\nRevolut has raised new funding in a share sale that values it at $75 billion, positioning the British neobank as one of Europe’s most valuable private tech companies.\nThe company said on Monday the deal was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer, and Fidelity. Investors including Nvidia’s NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton, and other backers advised by T. Rowe Price Associates also participated.\nRevolut did not mention how much it raised in the share sale, but it did say it allowed employees to cash out in the deal. As of August 2025, the company had a post-money valuation of $48 billion, and has raised a total of $2.89 billion in venture capital, according to PitchBook.\nFounded in 2015, Revolut offers a range of services spanning multi-currency accounts, payment and transfer services, crypto products, insurance, and more. The new funding comes as the neobank has been pouring truckloads of cash into expanding its operations internationally.\nBesides the U.K., where the company is awaiting a final nod to operate as a full-fledged bank, Revolut has a banking license in the European Union, and it operates in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. It launched operations in India in October, is about to start operating in Colombia in 2026, and has received a banking license in Mexico. \nIt also has plans to launch in Argentina, wants to enter Africa (first with South Africa), and has an in-principal payments license in the UAE.\nThe company’s been doing well financially, too: In 2024, its revenue rose 72% to $4 billion, and it claims it reached $1 billion in annualized revenue this year. Per its last annual report, Revolut reported net profit of $1 billion (£790 million) in 2024. The company also launched a crypto exchange, Revolut X, part of its Wealth division, which saw revenue rise 298% to $647 million in 2024 from just $158 million in 2023.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has grand ambitions, aiming to reach 100 million customers by mid-2027, and enter over 30 new markets by 2030.\n“This milestone reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” Nik Storonsky, CEO and co-founder of Revolut, said in a statement.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nFacebook Groups are getting more Reddit-like with newly added support for nicknames. The feature, which allows users to post under a custom username instead of their real name, provides an alternative to posting anonymously. With anonymous posting, users can share without the post being connected to their Facebook profile and real-life identity, but this approach also doesn’t allow other group members to get to know them or their personality, or to follow their updates over time.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nMeta says that nicknames will allow people to participate in groups more personally while maintaining privacy, particularly in groups where users want privacy but still want to build a recognizable presence. It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s long-standing “real name” policy, which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life.\nThat policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nAfter users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature. This allows users to hide their main profile and profile photo from other members but not from group admins, moderators, or Facebook’s own systems.\nHowever, others in the group will be able to view a user’s complete post history under their nickname in that group, as well as the comments and reactions made in the group over the last seven days.\nFacebook will suggest nicknames to users, but users can change this nickname to one of their choosing. The name has to comply with Facebook’s Community Standards and can’t already be used by another group member. The company will also suggest a profile picture for the nickname, though users can pick their own from those available, along with selecting a colored background.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nTo access the feature, users will find the option next to “Post anonymously” when creating a post and then choose the option to customize a nickname. The option to use the nickname can be turned off at any time, allowing users to post under their real name again.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile users can change their nickname, they can only do so once every two days. Additionally, changing a nickname doesn’t allow users to distance themselves from past posts and comments. Instead, when changed, their new nickname will be applied to their past posts, comments, and reactions, though this may take time to appear across devices and groups. If users have different nicknames in different groups, the name change will only impact the posts, comments, and reactions in the group tied to that specific nickname.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nThe company says users with nicknames can’t use some features like Live Video, content sharing, or private messaging. Users can block others by nickname, as well.\nThe feature is available globally but requires group admin approval to enable in each group.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nProduct demos get all the attention, but software development more often involves things like debugging, quality assurance, and testing. It’s the dull but critical work that keeps software running the way it should, and as developers look to automate more of their workloads, it’s increasingly being done by AI.\nOn Monday, the AI testing startup Momentic said it had raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures. Existing investors at Y Combinator, FCVC, Transpose Platform, and Karman Ventures also participated in the round. The new funding builds on a $3.7 million seed round, which the company announced in March.\nMomentic makes tools for software testing and verification, a niche currently occupied by open source frameworks like Playwright and Selenium. Those tools offer complex, fine-grained controls, but Momentic is counting on AI to make the process simple and effective.\n“We help our customers make sure their product works,” co-founder Wei-Wei Wu said. “They can describe their critical user flows in plain English and our AI will automate it.”\nWu and his co-founder Jeff An both have backgrounds in developer tooling at companies like Qualtrics and WeWork. (Wu is particularly proud of his contributions to the open source Node.js.)\nThe biggest constant for all those companies, as Wu saw it, was the problem of verifying code. “Testing has been the biggest pain point for every team I’ve ever worked with,” Wu told TechCrunch.\nMomentic’s AI-driven approach has already won over a number of clients. The company currently boasts 2,600 users across its customer base, which includes companies like Notion, Xero, Bilt, Webflow, and Retool. Wu was coy about revenue and profitability figures, but says the product has shown enough growth to convince investors.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNotably, automating tests makes them much easier to perform at scale, and has the potential to drive up the total volume to levels that would previously have been impossible. Wu estimates that, in the last month, the company automated more than 200 million test steps.\nThe company’s biggest competitor may be the foundation models themselves. Both OpenAI and Anthropic offer tutorials on agentic testing, building on their models’ growing computer use capabilities. As those models grow more sophisticated, the opportunity for enterprise SaaS companies like Momentic could narrow.\nFor now, Wu is focused on fleshing out his product with the new funding. The company launched support for mobile environments in August, and is hoping to build more sophisticated test-case management once it has a few more engineers on board. \nAs Wu sees it, the rise of automated coding will produce a lot of new apps — and a lot more demand for products like his. “All of these apps need testing,” he said. “They care about quality, and we’re going to provide it for them.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nShort videos are in high demand. Across large platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, users are watching billions of videos every day, with companies benefiting massively from this content explosion. For creators, this often means there is pressure to create more content than ever before to be relevant and make a living out of it, especially as more AI-generated slop is infiltrating these platforms.\nJay Neo, a creator and former content lead for short videos at MrBeast, thinks AI can help creators understand what is working for them and also help them create new content ideas in that direction. That’s why, along with former Palantir engineer Shivam Kumar and creator Harry Jones, they are building a platform called Palo to aid creators.\nShivam Kumar and Jay NeoImage Credits:Jack Willingham\nNeo joined MrBeast at 18 to work on viewer retention. In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped.\n“I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said.\nNeo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to get a baguette, which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format.\nIn 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month.\nWith these experiences, Neo understood there’s power in content formulation and analytics. During his time building Creaky, the team had multiple spreadsheets tracking different metrics around videos. At that time, one of Neo’s advisors suggested that he turn these insights into a product for creators, and he started working with Palo’s other co-founders in early 2024.\nImage Credits:Palo\nPalo has three core parts to its app: an AI-powered ideation and planning tool, analytics, and community. The company onboards a creator and asks them to integrate all their accounts. The tool then analyzes all their short videos and provides insights into what is working and what is not.\nKumar, who is CTO at the startup, said that Palo uses a mix of models to extract a data tree that has insights into hooks, audience sentiment, interest topics, originality, and possible related search terms.\n“The inference engine takes these primary data points and then uses a cocktail of top LLMs to hierarchically aggregate these data points into cache for hot memory, embeddings which can later be semantically retrieved, and various other structured data formats,” Kumar said. “All of these together help us build a persona for the creator, which is true to them and fully aware of their taste and style.”\nThe AI planner has a conversational interface, like any other chatbot, and creators can ask general questions about their content. Plus, they can ask the tool to create a script based on a formula. If someone is a more visual creator with less speech in their clips, the tool can also create a storyboard with different hooks. \nRight now, the community part is nascent and allows creators to message each other.\nImage Credits:Palo\nIn its test phase, the company worked with around 40 creators with more than 1 million users across channels. Today, the company is opening up its tool to creators with 100,000 followers with a starting price of $250 a month to use the tool, with costlier tiers available for higher usage rates. \nThe company has raised $3.8 million in funding from Peak XV’s (formerly Sequoia India) Surge, with participation from NFX and individual investors. \nPeak XV’s managing director, Rajan Anandan, said the firm was introduced to Palo’s team by one of Neo’s mentors. He said the team’s experience in being part of successful creative teams and technical understanding edged the firm toward investing in the startup.\n“Creators everywhere are looking for tools that make their process smoother without taking away their voice. Jay and the team had unusual clarity about where the real value lies and where it does not, which gave us strong conviction. AI is enabling a new category of identity-aware systems that learn deeply from the world’s best creators,” he told TechCrunch.\nJosh Constine, a former TechCrunch editor and investor in Palo, said that the tool can help creators keep up with heavy content demands. \n“I’ve experienced burnout as a creator myself, which is why I invested in Palo. The challenge today is that to keep up with the latest viral hooks and strategies to beat the algorithm, you have to spend hours per day getting brain-rotted, consuming content, which I think rewires your brain to default to consumption instead of making something new. That can lead to procrastination, writer’s block, and burnout,”  Constine said.\nPalo’s launch comes at a time when there is palpable tension between AI and the creator community. Platforms like TikTok, Meta, and Google have added more AI-powered tools for creators. While creators have started using AI tools, folks like MrBeast have spoken about the negative impact it could have on the industry.\nA core challenge in creating AI tools for creators is to have them fall into a formulaic habit of creating similar content. Neo said that Palo, the tool, tries to nudge creators in a direction where they might be successful and admitted that good videos will still come out of creators’ gut feelings.  \n“Here’s an analogy… when a comedian tries out some new material on the stage, they’re both consciously and subconsciously gathering data on whether the audience was amused or not. Each performance becomes an iteration, and each new audience benefits from what the comedian learned from the show before. We believe AI can give creators a similar advantage,” Neo said. \nSam Beres, a creator also known as Sambucha, said that AI companies working in creator tooling should always involve creators from conception to understand their pain points better.\n“Many times, AI tools will present a plethora of irrelevant information and ironically hinder creators because they’ll get shiny object syndrome and directionlessly use emerging AI without actually enhancing their videos. That’s why I always advise emerging AI companies to partner with creators at launch/conception not only for marketing efforts, but also, and more importantly, to help build out the product where applicable,” he noted.\n"

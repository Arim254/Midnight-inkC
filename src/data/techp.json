This investment would be part of a $2 billion funding round Poolside is raising at a $12 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.\nNvidia’s investment could rise to $1 billion if the company successfully completes the rest of the funding round, Bloomberg reported.\nThis wouldn’t be Nvidia’s first investment in Poolside. The company previously backed Poolside in its $500 million Series B round in October 2024.\nNvidia, already a prolific investor in AI startups, has been broadening its portfolio to include diverse sectors. For example, Nvidia said it was exploring a $500 million investment into U.K.-based self-driving company Wayve in October. Last month, the company took a $5 billion stake in Intel with plans for future chip collaboration.\nTechCrunch reached out to Poolside for more information.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp’s backup.\nFor years, WhatsApp didn’t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups with end-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys.\nThe trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don’t need to look for the password or the key. \nWhatsApp, which crossed 3 billion active users in May, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a eye on when it becomes available to you.\nYou can go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encrypted backup to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

During Reddit’s Q3 2025 call, the exec noted that Google search and direct access continue to be its top traffic drivers. \n“[Chatbots are] not a traffic driver today. I think our relationships with the companies that we work for — or work with directly are healthy, and we both learned a lot over the last couple of years, really the value of Reddit’s data and where our respective products can go and how we can help each other. So I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners. But they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Huffman said during the call with analysts.\nAn analyst asked the company if 50% of the traffic comes from Google and 50% direct, Huffman said that those numbers are “approximate, but pretty close.”\nReddit has had a tricky relationship with LLM builders. The company locked down its data through a new policy change in May 2024 and indicated that any kind of commercial use of its data would need a license. At the same time, the company signed a deal with OpenAI to let it use Reddit data for model training. \nThe company also has a partnership agreement with Google. On the other hand, the company has ensued a legal battle with AI companies like Anthropic and Perplexity.\nReddit reported a positive quarter with $585 million in revenue, up 68% year-on-year. The company also clocked in 116 million daily active unique users and 444 million weekly active unique users, with 20% growth year-over-year. The company mentioned it recorded 31% year-on-year growth in international daily users. It also said that more than 190 million Americans visit the social network every week.\nThe company mentioned that it continues to invest in making the search experience a central part of the experience. Huffman said that the company is handling 20% of search volumes through its AI-powered Answers and “that kind of core search box.” He noted that in Q3, 75 million people searched weekly on Reddit. The company has been talking about unifying AI and the core search experience, and Huffman said it is coming in the next few quarters.\nWhat’s more, Reddit is experimenting with a new and simpler onboarding flow to increase early user engagement.\n“We want them to see in their first session that Reddit is amazing and has content for them. So our goal is to connect users with relevant content very quickly,” Huffman said.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple CEO Tim Cook signaled to investors the company is still open to acquisitions and partnerships to move things forward on the AI front. \nThe comments were made this week during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. The exec also offered a brief update about Apple’s next-generation, AI-powered Siri, saying the service was still on track to launch in 2026.\n“We’re making good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it next year,” Cook said during his opening remarks. \nOne analyst on the call also asked Cook if Apple was still pursuing a three-pronged approach when it came to the development of its personalized AI — meaning a combination of in-house Apple foundation models, partnerships with third-party LLM providers, and acquisitions. \nCook responded that Apple was still open to the latter, noting the company continually surveils the market on M&A and  is “open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will advance our roadmap.”\nIn a pre-earnings interview with CNBC, Cook noted that Apple was preparing to announce more AI partnerships like the one it has with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,” Cook told the outlet.\nOn the earnings call, Cook also talked about how Apple creates foundation models, ships them on devices, and uses them in Private Cloud Compute, its cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing.\nCook shared later in the call that Apple is already using its Private Cloud Compute technology for a number of Siri queries and is continuing to build out that infrastructure.\n“In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we’ve got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. And, you know, it’s robust,” he said. \nCook additionally suggested that AI was a factor in consumers’ decision-making process when it comes to selecting a new smartphone. \n“I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor,” he said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Luminar started the year with around 580 employees, but the company did not specify the size of the layoff earlier this year. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe company also announced its chief financial officer, Thomas Fennimore, is stepping down on November 13 “to pursue other career opportunities.” Luminar said Fennimore’s departure is “not the result of any disagreement” about its finances or with the company’s auditors.\nThis all comes as founder Austin Russell — who was replaced as CEO in May following an unspecified ethics inquiry by the board of directors’ audit committee — is in the middle of an effort to buy the company. That buyout was encouraged by at least some of the board members, as TechCrunch previously reported.\nLuminar has struggled in part because it has sold fewer lidar sensors to Volvo, which was supposed to be a major customer. In August, Fennimore said Luminar was therefore selling the sensors at a lower cost than it takes to build them. \nLuminar said Friday that it has $72 million of cash and marketable securities as of October 24. Without any additional fundraising, the current burn rate means Luminar could run out of money as early as the first quarter of next year, or breach the terms of certain loan agreements. \nOn Friday, Luminar revealed it had already skipped required quarterly interest payments on certain loans that were due October 15. Those lenders have agreed to give Luminar until November 6 to make the payments before taking any action.\nLuminar is not due to report its third-quarter financial results for another two weeks, but on Friday, it revealed it expects to report around $18 million of revenue and debt of $429 million.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAI search startup Perplexity has signed a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images, which gives it  permission to display images from Getty across its AI-powered search and discovery tools. The deal marks a notable shift for the company, which has been hit by allegations of content scraping and plagiarism, and signals an effort to establish more formal content partnerships. \nPerplexity and Getty have been working together for more than a year, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. Though it was never announced, Getty was part of Perplexity’s Publishers’ Program, a plan to share ad revenue with publishers when their content surfaced in a search query, the source said.  \nToday’s agreement is a new deal. A source told TechCrunch it’s not a traditional lump sum licensing deal, since Perplexity doesn’t train its own foundational models, but would not elaborate on the terms. \nPerplexity’s agreement with Getty appears to legitimize some of the startup’s previous use of Getty’s stock photos. Perplexity came under fire last year for a series of plagiarism accusations from several news organizations. In one case, the startup was called out for pulling content from a Wall Street Journal article, including the Getty photo in that piece.  \nAt the time, several outlets questioned whether Perplexity’s use of the images constituted copyright infringement. A source last year told TechCrunch that Perplexity was working on an agreement with Getty, but we were unable to confirm the deal after reaching out to stock image giant several times.  \nMore recently, Reddit sued Perplexity in October, alleging “industrial-scale, unlawful” scraping of user content and circumventing technical measures to access data. Reddit has a data licensing agreement with OpenAI. \nPerplexity says its Getty deal will help it better display images and include credits with links back to the original source whenever images show up in search results. \nNick Unsworth, vice president of strategic development at Getty, said the agreement “acknowledges the importance of properly attributed consent and its value in enhancing AI-powered products.” \n“Attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand the world in an age of AI,” Jessica Chan, head of content and publisher partnerships at Perplexity, said in a statement. “Together, we’re helping people discover answers through powerful visual storytelling while ensuring they always know where that content comes from and who created it.” \nPerplexity’s emphasis on attribution is part of its strategy of defending against copyright accusations by arguing its use of publisher content – including content behind a paywall or that publishers have explicitly indicated they don’t want scraped – constitutes “fair use” because publicly available facts are not copyrightable.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nNavan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company.\nThe company was the first to use a new SEC rule that allows public listings during a government shutdown.\nUnlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval.\nBut the updated mechanism carries a risk: The government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation.\nDespite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1.\nThe stock’s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty.\nThe market’s reaction to Navan’s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they’re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNavan has been waiting to go public for several years. The company reportedly filed its confidential IPO paperwork in 2022 and planned to debut at a $12 billion valuation in early 2023.  \nThe company, formerly known as TripActions, was last valued at $9.2 billion when it raised a $154 million Series G round in October 2022.\nNavan customers include Shopify, Zoom, Wayfair, OpenAI, and Thomson Reuters. The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan’s expense management solution helps companies manage employee expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization.\nThe company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to its S1.\nNavan’s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entrée Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman.\nFigma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform.\nWeavy’s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want.\nImage Credits:Figma\nUsers start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.\nThe startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation.\nImage Credits:Figma\n“This node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft.

    "body": "\nCluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: You should be thinking harder about how to go viral.\n“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nBut he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. \n“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”\nCluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andreessen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.\nAs Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”\nFor Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Reputation is sort of a thing of the past,” Lee said. “You can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you’ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you’ve got Elon Musk going bats— crazy.”\n“You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” he continued, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic, and you have to be personal.”\nIt’s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, Lee demurred.\n“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said. “I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAdam, one of the most viral startups in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch, has raised a $4.1 million seed round to power its next steps, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\nAfter generating over 10 million social media impressions with the launch of its text-to-3D model app, the AI startup had its pick of investors. \n“We were getting term sheets over email without any meetings,” said CEO Zach Dive (on the right of the picture).\nAdam quickly went with TQ Ventures as its lead investor because they agreed on the future of computer-aided design (CAD). Just as importantly, they also agreed on Adam’s roadmap — going consumer first, and then to enterprise.\nThis required the most alignment: Adam caught people’s attention with a mainstream product, not an enterprise one. But Dive said this choice is paying off, and paving the way for Adam’s upcoming copilot for professional-grade CAD workflows.\nThe startup had always planned to go B2B, but felt that the technology wasn’t enterprise-ready yet — which is why it initially focused on makers, not engineers. But AI models improved faster than they expected, and Adam now plans to launch its copilot by the end of the year, Dive said.\nIts initial tool lets creators without CAD skills create 3D models from text prompts, but early feedback showed that text wasn’t always the best way to interact with 3D, Dive said. “So for our copilot, we blended in different interaction paradigms; for example, users selecting different parts of the 3D object and conversing with it.” \nThis will give the startup an element of differentiation compared to other text-to-CAD products, although there is already competition in the ‘AI copilot for CAD’ segment as well. MecAgent, for instance, is already available, but Adam could capitalize on its viral launch.\nEarly momentum particularly helped with hiring, which is still an ongoing effort, Dive said. He and his cofounder, Adam CPO Aaron Li, both graduated from UC Berkeley’s Master of Design program, but the startup also needs more AI and engineering talent to “give models the right context for reasoning in space.”\nCapital and endorsements can both help with this endeavor, and Adam now has its fair share of both, sometimes combined. Besides TQ and participating funds 468 Capital, Pioneer, Script Capital, and Transpose Platform, Adam is also backed by angel investors, including Tim Glaser (Posthog), Trevor Blackwell (YC), and Theo Browne (T3 Chat).\nIn addition, Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch called Adam “the v0 of CAD” (in a nod to Vercel’s V0, an AI-powered platform for web creation). \n“It’s simpler, faster, and reaches a broader audience,” he wrote on X.\nAdam is already on its way to reaching a broad audience, with “tens of thousands of individual users and a growing base of paying customers” for its standard and pro plans, which respectively start at $5.99 and $17.99 per month. The startup hasn’t begun to monetize its soon-to-launch enterprise offering, but has “testers validating different features,” Dive said.\nThis testing phase is clearly necessary: there’s quite a jump from helping amateurs print 3D Pikachus to supporting engineers in their daily work. Dive said the startup doesn’t intend to replace them, but instead streamlines time-consuming tasks such as applying the same change to multiple CAD files.\nWith an initial focus on mechanical engineering, the startup plans to help these pro users generate feature‑rich parametric designs in popular CAD programs, beginning with Onshape, which is known for bringing CAD to the cloud and reshaping workflows. “The same thing will be true with AI,” Dive predicted.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is visiting South Korea for the first time in fifteen years to unveil new plans and deepen collaboration with major Korean tech companies — including Hyundai Motor, Samsung, SK, and Naver. During this week’s APEC Summit 2025, Nvidia and the South Korean government announced an expanded partnership to boost the country’s AI infrastructure and physical AI capabilities.\nThe announcement comes just days after the U.S. signed technology deals with Japan and South Korea, aiming to deepen strategic ties and boost collaboration on emerging technologies, including AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotech, and 6G.\nSouth Korea will secure over 260,000 of Nvidia’s latest GPUs to meet growing AI demands, the South Korean government announced on Friday. Around 50,000 GPUs will support public initiatives, including the development of domestic AI foundation models and a national AI data center. The remaining over 200,000 GPUs will go to companies such as Samsung, SK, Hyundai Motor Group, and Naver, driving AI-based manufacturing innovation and industry-specific AI model development.\nNvidia, Samsung team up on AI factory and AI-RAN for 6G \nSamsung also announced plans to build an AI Megafactory in partnership with Nvidia, bringing AI into every stage of its manufacturing for semiconductors, mobile devices, and robotics. Using more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs and the Omniverse platform, the facility will form an intelligent network capable of analyzing, predicting, and optimizing production in real time.\nSamsung and Nvidia, partners for over 25 years, are now collaborating on HBM4, a next-generation memory designed to power future AI applications.\nNvidia will work with Samsung, three Korean telecom operators — SK Telecom, KT, and LG Uplus — and ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute) to co-develop AI-RAN, according to the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT.\nAI-RAN combines mobile base stations with AI to boost performance and cut battery use, and under a new agreement, Nvidia and South Korea’s industry and research institutions will jointly develop next-generation AI-RAN and a global testbed, the Korean government stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn mid-October, Nvidia said Samsung Foundry will help make custom CPUs and XPUs, following its work with Intel to connect x86 CPUs directly to Nvidia platforms via NVLink Fusion.\nHyundai drives future mobility with AI factory\nMeanwhile, Hyundai and Nvidia are joining forces to build AI infrastructure and advance technologies in physical AI. The partnership plans to focus on autonomous mobility, smart factories, and robotics, while collaborating on high-performance GPU supply and investment\nAccording to Nvidia, the companies will use 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for integrated AI model training, validation, and deployment, and will establish AI research centers in South Korea to strengthen the country’s physical AI industry.\n“AI is revolutionizing every facet of every industry, and in transportation alone — from vehicle design and manufacturing to robotics and autonomous driving — Nvidia’s AI and computing platforms are transforming how the world moves,” said Huang. “Together with Hyundai Motor Group — Korea’s industrial powerhouse and one of the world’s top mobility solutions providers — we’re building intelligent cars and factories that will shape the future of the multitrillion-dollar mobility industry.”\nSK builds AI cloud; Naver partners on physical AI\nSK Group, parent of SK Hynix, is partnering with Nvidia to build Asia’s first enterprise-led manufacturing AI cloud, leveraging Nvidia’s simulation and digital twin platforms and opening access to the government, public institutions, and domestic startups.\nNaver Cloud, the cloud arm of Korean search engine Naver, is collaborating with NVIDIA to develop a next-generation “Physical AI” platform that connects the physical and digital worlds. The cloud company intends to deploy AI infrastructure across key industries, including semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, and biotechnology, aiming to accelerate the adoption of AI solutions optimized for real-world industrial environments, according to Naver.\n“Just as the automotive industry is transitioning to SDVs, the era of ‘Physical AI,’ where AI operates directly within real industrial sites and systems, is unfolding,” Hae-jin Lee, founder of Naver, said in Naver’s statement.\nNvidia’s collaborations with Korean big tech giants — from Samsung’s AI network initiatives to Hyundai’s software-defined vehicles, SK Group’s industrial AI applications, and Naver’s cloud and AI services — highlight a broader trend, which is the fusion of AI and hardware across industries. These partnerships show how global tech leaders are joining forces to shape the next generation of intelligent systems.\nEarlier this week, the U.S. tech giant announced a wave of new partnerships with companies including Eli Lilly, Palantir, Hyundai, Samsung, Uber, and Joby Aviation, along with the U.S. Department of Energy, as CEO Jensen Huang sought to downplay concerns about an AI bubble. The news sent its stock soaring, as Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market capitalization.\n"

    "body": "\nMost people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.\nBevel, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.\nThe investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old health tech company.\nBevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. Additionally, the company says the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days — rare metrics in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.\n“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”\nBut with so many health companion brands, from Whoop to Oura to Eight Sleep, why does the world need another one?\nAccording to Aditya Agarwal, a Bevel co-founder and board member who is also a partner at venture firm South Park Commons, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“A $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,” said Agarwal. “[People] already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.\nUnlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area — such as steps, sleep, or nutrition — Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.\nAll this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which analyzes and adapts recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.\nImage Credits:Bevel\nBevel’s story started with pain — literally.\nBefore starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder/CTO Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises. The demanding nature of startup life led Nguyen to neglect his health, and he developed chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.\n“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”\nNguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.\nSimilarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually — through spreadsheets and connected trackers — to rebuild his energy.\nWhen he connected with Yang and Nguyen about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team as a co-founder and board member.\n“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year in a seed round.\nWith fresh capital and no plans to develop its own wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand into additional health services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.\n“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app” that they download and forget.\n"

    "body": "\nCreative suite company Canva launched its own design model on Thursday that understands design layers and formats to power its features. The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets.\nCanva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.\n“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call. \n“What we’ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.”\nEarlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs.\nUsers can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design.\nThe company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it’s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCanva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta.\nAlong with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms.\nThe company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand’s aesthetics.\nCanva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users.\nCanva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It’s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Shortly after the launch of communities and disappearing “ghost posts,” the social networking app on Thursday introduced new tools that will give users more control over their conversations on the platform.\nOne new feature, reply approvals, will allow you to decide which replies from other users will appear on your posts — before anyone else can see them.\nWhile Threads, like other social networks, already offers tools that let you limit replies to people you follow, your followers, or people you mention, the new feature allows you to keep your replies open to all without the negative consequences of having discussions derailed.\nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nAs the company explains, these tools will help you “set the tone of the conversation,” and give users more choice. It’s a unique way to balance users’ interest in engaging in more public conversations, but one where the poster — not those replying — still has the power. \nIn addition, the company is rolling out new Activity feed filters that will allow you to more easily view the replies from people you follow or those that include mentions. These join other options like Verified, Quotes, Reposts, and more as other ways to filter replies. \nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nMeta announced during its third-quarter earnings call this week that Threads has now reached 150 million daily active users, up from over 100 million in December 2024.

    "body": "\nIndia’s appetite for instant convenience — once confined to food and grocery delivery — is expanding into house help. That shift has helped Snabbit, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from $80 million five months ago.\nThe all-equity Series C round — Snabbit’s third fundraise in nine months — was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup’s total funding to $55 million.\nSnabbit’s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes.\nCurrently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals.\nSnabbit founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal with a few of its women experts.Image Credits:Snabbit\nSome of Snabbit’s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. “We’re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, ‘Hey, this was happening offline, and now we’ll do it online,’” said Agarwal.\nThe startup reports a 30% to 35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of “well below” ₹500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit’s services are priced at around ₹150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around ₹240 (roughly $3).\nWorkers on the platform earn between ₹25,000 and ₹30,000 (approximately $284 to $340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers.\nSnabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such as Broomees and Pronto. Urban Company now plans to double down on instant home services to stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge.\n“In a hyper-local business, you don’t win pan India, you don’t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,” Agarwal said.\nThe new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elder care.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

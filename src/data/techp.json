    "body": "\nNetflix has rolled out a new TV experience for kids’ profiles on its service globally, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Tuesday. The update, which aims to simplify the design and navigation, is the company’s latest attempt to more quickly connect users to content they’ll like.\nIn May, Netflix introduced a similar redesign of its TV homepage for standard profiles, which added an AI-powered search tool, better recommendations, and more visible shortcuts, among other changes.\nNow the company says the same update has arrived on kids’ profiles, along with other tweaks aimed specifically at Netflix’s youngest users.\nThe new design simplifies the look and feel of the homepage. It also offers a new navigation bar at the top that links to “My Netflix,” a section that brings together everything kids have watched, saved, and loved in a single place. This makes it easier for users to revisit favorite content — something that younger users often do by rewatching their top movies and episodes.\nIn addition, Netflix says kids’ recommendations will refresh in real time, as they do on standard profiles. The company hopes this will decrease the time kids spend searching for something to watch.\nSome things on the Kids profile won’t change, however: the Character Themed Rows, Mystery Box suggestions, and parental controls are still available.\nNetflix also announced other updates for Netflix today, including features like real-time voting, live party games, podcasts, and more. Next year, for instance, Netflix will launch real-time voting on its upcoming new show “Star Search,” after earlier tests with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.”\nThe company says the new user interface is tied to these changes, as it offers a more flexible canvas for different types of creative content, including interactive content. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

In August, LG’s telecom division initially denied any signs of a breach, even as KT reported that data from users had been exposed following the connection of unauthorized micro base stations to its network. KISA declined to comment.\nThe move comes about two months after the hacking magazine Phrack claimed that hackers from China or North Korea had stolen data from close to 9,000 LG Uplus servers.\nLG Uplus’s report comes amid a wave of high-profile hacks in South Korea affecting telecoms, credit card companies, tech startups, and government agencies, highlighting vulnerabilities previously reported by TechCrunch. \nSouth Korea’s fragmented cybersecurity system and a shortage of experts have hindered the country’s response to the cyber threats.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nUber has picked San Francisco to launch a premium robotaxi service that will use Lucid Motors’ all-electric Gravity SUVs equipped with self-driving tech developed by Nuro, in 2026 — a move that puts the ride-hailing giant in direct competition with Waymo.\nThe announcement was made as the last day of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 kicked off in San Francisco. Nuro president and co-CEO Dave Ferguson, and Uber chief product officer Sachin Kansal are scheduled to be interviewed on the Disrupt stage Wednesday afternoon.\n“The Bay Area has long been the birthplace of transformative technology, and it’s only fitting that Uber’s next-generation robotaxi program with Lucid and Nuro will begin here — launching to the public next year,” Kansal said in a statement. “By combining deep expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we’re laying the groundwork for safe and scalable autonomous rides in the Bay Area and beyond.”\nEarlier this year, Uber said it would invest $300 million in Lucid and separately buy “at least” 20,000 of its new Gravity SUVs over the next six years as part of a plan to develop and launch a premium robotaxi service. Those EVs would be equipped with Nuro’s autonomous vehicle system, and owned and operated by Uber or its third-party fleet partners. At the time, the three companies had not identified their launch market.\nThe decision to launch in San Francisco could add tension to Uber’s relationship with Waymo. The companies had squared off in 2018 in a trade secrets theft case, but have since patched up — earlier this year, they launched a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta.\nNow, Uber is entering a domain dominated by the Alphabet-owned self-driving division. Waymo, based in Mountain View, California, operates commercial robotaxi services in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. The company has said it plans to launch in six more cities in 2026.\nUber, Nuro and Lucid are already developing a fleet of test vehicles. Lucid recently delivered vehicles to Nuro, which is integrating its self-driving system into the fleet for testing and validation. The test fleet is expected to reach about 100 vehicles, according to the companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesting on public roads will be the most visible sign of the partnership, but Nuro also plans to use simulation and closed courses for testing.\nOver the past two years, Uber has locked in a bevy of partnerships with autonomous vehicle technology companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world — although its deals with Waymo, Nuro and Lucid might be the meatiest. The ride-hailing giant has partnered with more than 18 companies globally, across ride-hailing, delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, WeRide and Baidu.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nMogul, the film studio fantasy platform created by the movie theater subscription service MoviePass, on Wednesday launched out of private beta, the company announced. The platform is now available as a public beta for everyone.\nDesigned specifically for the Hollywood industry, players own their own film studio and draft a team of actors, directors, and movies to earn points based on their performance. Mogul draws inspiration from daily fantasy sports, where players assume the role of team managers, forming teams made up of real-life athletes.\nToday, the web version of Mogul is open for the over 400,000 users on the waiting list. The platform has also begun rolling out to the public.\nAround 5,000 users, including myself, have tested the platform. Although I’ve only experienced the pre-season phase, which lacks active gameplay and a leaderboard, I still have a general idea of the mechanics. Overall, it was relatively straightforward to figure out, which I was surprised about, given my limited knowledge of fantasy sports.\nHere’s how to play\nAfter you create a name for your studio, you’ll receive a budget of one million “Mogul Coin,” the platform’s virtual currency (since you’re not playing with real money). This initial budget is yours to use to assemble your team. \nFor example, the sequel “Wicked: For Good” is $100,000, and the actresses Cynthia Erivo (playing Elphaba) and Ariana Grande (as Glinda) are $25,000 each. Director Jon M. Chu is also $25,000. \nYou have a week to finalize your choices, and you can make two free swaps each week. \nImage Credits:MoviePass\nMoviePass founder Stacy Spikes told TechCrunch that the company tried to develop a game that emulates a real film studio and “how you have to act like a mogul.” \nSo, when conducting these swaps, you need to be strategic just like a studio head would. For instance, “Tron: Ares” star Jared Leto is currently facing sexual misconduct allegations, and this may affect the movie’s performance. \nSpikes gave us some additional tips during our discussion. For example, it’s important to keep an eye out for up-and-coming stars, as sometimes they’re the ones who’ll really take off. Also, consider looking at Bollywood films as they can be overlooked by people who think only about big franchises, like Marvel. Independent films can also bring in significant returns.\nAnother key point to remember is that you’re competing based on net profitability rather than total gross revenue. Timing is also critical; betting on a movie earlier typically costs less, whereas choosing one closer to its release date might be more expensive. \nImage Credits:MoviePass\nMogul operates on Sui, a layer 1 blockchain, which records every selection and trade. As users climb the leaderboard, they can earn digital collectibles, such as signed posters and memorabilia. \nCurrently, everyone will participate in a global league. The fall season will last 12 weeks, spanning October, November, and December, coinciding with awards season. For this first season, users have a chance to share in a prize pool worth up to $100,000 in tokens, aimed at encouraging more people to sign up.\nMoviePass is also granting exclusive in-app badges and Founding Member status to users who activate their accounts by 11:59 p.m. ET on October 31.\nPlans for private leagues among friends are in development, along with an app for iOS and Android devices. By next year, Spikes claims a licensing deal may be established, enabling you to compete for real money.\n"

Aurora also said it has completed more than 100,000 driverless miles on public roads with five self-driving trucks, a milestone for the company that launched its commercial service in May. The company’s next pre-stated goal is to expand to Phoenix by the end of the year.\nAurora’s initial commercial service began with a Dallas-to-Houston route with launch customers Hirschbach Motor Lines and Uber Freight. \nThe Fort Worth-to-El Paso route is long enough to become compelling to carriers, according to Aurora, which cites staff challenges and the difficulty of completing a 10-hour haul in a single day. Customers on the El Paso route include Hirschbach Motor Lines as well as Russell Transport.\nAurora also shared details on next-generation hardware, which is made by Fabrinet and is being integrated with the Volvo VNL Autonomous trucks. Aurora plans to build 100s of trucks with its next-gen hardware in 2026. \nIt says the hardware is more durable and has better performance, yet it is half the overall cost. The company’s new generation of lidar detects objects 1,000 meters away, which is twice the distance of its current generation. Aurora also has improved its sensor cleaning, which it says will operate more reliably in harsh weather conditions.\n“The integration of Aurora’s next-generation hardware with the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at our New River Valley facility marks an industry-first partnership and highlights the meaningful progress we are making together,” said Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions. “By manufacturing trucks purpose-built for autonomy, we’re moving beyond prototypes and creating scalable solutions that are ready to meet the demands of a modern supply chain.”\nThis next-generation hardware will come ahead of a suite of higher-volume hardware that is being jointly developed with Aumovio, formerly Continental, which is slated for production in 2027. The company plans to build up to “tens of thousands of self-driving trucks” when its manufacturing partnership with Aumovio begins in 2027. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nIndian automotive giant Tata Motors has fixed a series of security flaws that exposed sensitive internal data, including personal information of customers, company reports, and data related to its dealers.\nSecurity researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaws in Tata Motors’ E-Dukaan unit, an e-commerce portal for buying spare parts for Tata-made commercial vehicles. Headquartered in Mumbai, Tata Motors produces passenger cars, as well as commercial and defense vehicles. The company has a presence in 125 countries worldwide and seven assembly facilities, per its website.\nZveare said he found that the portal’s web source code included the private keys to access and modify data within Tata Motors’ account on Amazon Web Services, the researcher said in a blog post.\nThe exposed data, Zveare told TechCrunch, included hundreds of thousands of invoices containing customer information, such as their names, mailing addresses, and permanent account number, or PAN, a ten-character unique identifier issued by the Indian government.\n“Out of respect for not causing some type of alarm bell or massive egress bill at Tata Motors, there were no attempts to exfiltrate large amounts of data or download excessively large files,” the researcher told TechCrunch.\nThere were also MySQL database backups and Apache Parquet files that included various bits of private customer information and communication, the researcher noted.\nThe AWS keys also enabled access to over 70 terabytes of data related to Tata Motors’ FleetEdge fleet-tracking software. Zveare also found backdoor admin access to a Tableau account, which included data of over 8,000 users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“As server admin, you had access to all of it. This primarily includes things like internal financial reports, performance reports, dealer scorecards, and various dashboards,” the researcher said.\nThe exposed data also included API access to Tata Motors’ fleet management platform, Azuga, which powers the company’s test drive website.\nShortly after discovering the issues, Zveare reported them to Tata Motors through the Indian computer emergency response team, known as CERT-In, in August 2023. Later in October 2023, Tata Motors told Zveare that it was working on fixing the AWS issues after securing the initial loopholes. However, the company did not say when the issues were fixed.\nTata Motors confirmed to TechCrunch that all the reported flaws were fixed in 2023, but would not say if it notified affected customers that their information was exposed.\n“We can confirm that the reported flaws and vulnerabilities were thoroughly reviewed following their identification in 2023 and were promptly and fully addressed,” said Tata Motors communications head Sudeep Bhalla, when contacted by TechCrunch.\n“Our infrastructure is regularly audited by leading cybersecurity firms, and we maintain comprehensive access logs to monitor for unauthorized activity. We also actively collaborate with industry experts and security researchers to strengthen our security posture and ensure timely mitigation of potential risks,” said Bhalla.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs grids come under strain from growing demand from data centers and EVs, geothermal startups have been racing to unlock energy that lurks deep within the Earth. Now, one startup has developed the world’s hottest geothermal well — one that harbors enough energy to power thousands of homes.\nMazama Energy said today that it had drilled a well in Oregon that reached 629˚ F (331˚ C) at the bottom of the borehole. Vinod Khosla, whose firm Khosla Ventures incubated the company, mentioned the milestone on stage today at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n“This one site can produce 5 gigawatts of energy,” Khosla said. \nThe potential at other sites could be even larger. “It’s not tens of megawatts, as usual [with] geothermal wells. You can do gigawatt scale, and frankly, do 100 gigawatts or more — more than AI is projected to use near term, just from super-hot geothermal.”\nThe company is hoping to eventually drill into even hotter rock, up to 750˚ F (400˚ C), to be able to generate at least 25 megawatts of electricity from one borehole. That would be about two to three times more power per borehole than competitors are generating today.\nGeothermal power has existed for decades, but most power plants tap shallow resources that occur where things like hot springs bring heat from the Earth’s mantle closer to the surface. Enhanced geothermal developers drill boreholes that are deeper and access greater and more consistent heat. The technology promises to make geothermal more productive and available in more places.\nBecause it relies on the Earth’s heat, enhanced geothermal can deliver electricity 24/7. It’s why companies like Google have inked deals to have geothermal power data centers.\nEnhanced geothermal has the potential to fulfill significant portions of existing and new energy demand in the U.S. Wells drilled in the Great Basin region centered on Nevada could deliver 10% of current demand in the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nTapping deeper rocks could unlock even more power using fewer resources. By injecting water into hotter wells, the amount of energy per borehole can ramp up significantly. Mazama said that it should be able to use 75% less water than current geothermal systems.\n“At 450˚ [Celsius], you get 10 times the power per well than you get at 200˚. Guess what? You also get dramatically lower cost, cost competitive — without worrying about carbon emissions — to natural gas,” Khosla said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The company later added a human observer in the truck cab several weeks later. \n“We can drive in generalized surface streets across right now in Texas, and you will be able to see us across the entire U.S. over the next few years as well,” said Urtasun, who previously served as chief scientist at Uber ATG before launching Waabi in 2021.\nWaabi rival Aurora has a similar deal with Volvo, and the two companies unveiled a self-driving truck in May 2024. Aurora launched a commercial service, which has a human observer on board, earlier this year on a route between Dallas and Houston. On Tuesday, it announced it was expanding to El Paso. Waabi is using the same truck, but it features Waabi’s tech, including its sensor suite, compute, and the Waabi Driver software. \nWaabi’s self-driving system called the Waabi Driver is an end-to-end AI model that enables the truck to scale autonomous driving across different geographies, including highways and general surface streets. Waabi says this enables commercial operations that are scalable, meet the needs of customers, and work within existing logistics operations.  \n“Volvo VNL has been built from the ground up for the redundancies so that you can remove the human driver and you can build a global, safe, robust product,” Urtasun said. “Our sensor pods are super lightweight; it’s very easy to integrate at the factory line.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaabi’s partnership with Volvo builds on the automaker’s investment into the startup in 2023 via its venture arm, Volvo Group Venture Capital.

    "body": "\nNetflix is looking to vertical video as a way to experiment with new content types, said CTO Elizabeth Stone, speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Tuesday. The exec noted the company didn’t want to compete directly with apps like TikTok or other short-form drama apps, but did acknowledge there are more ways that Netflix can take advantage of the mobile platform.\nIn response to a question about the competitive landscape on mobile, Stone agreed there are times when consumers are looking for something Netflix offers, like a TV show, movie, or game, but there are other times they want “something more snackable.”\nIn these moments, Netflix needs to be able to offer “a broader variety of content,” she said. \n“We’re testing a vertical video feed on mobile devices that starts to reimagine what mobile is, and kind of meets consumers where they are now and how they’re using mobile today.”\nThat feed, announced earlier this year as a test, allows members to scroll through clips of its original titles. The goal is to encourage Netflix users to be inspired to watch the show or movie.\nHowever, the company may have bigger plans for how that feed can be utilized, Stone’s comments suggested. \nThe exec pointed to Moments, a video clipping feature in the Netflix app that lets users clip and share their favorite scenes from a show or movie.\nThere’s potential for seeding those short clips into the vertical video feed, but Stone didn’t directly confirm this plan. Instead, she said more vaguely the company would experiment with “different types of content” that could be in the vertical feed, as well as “different ways to clip and share content.”\n“We’ve been innovating on Moments, which allows kind of a social connection to some of the content by allowing a member to take a clip and share it with their networks,” she said, adding that the feature is a type of short-form experience.\n“But [Netflix] is not intending to copy or chase exactly what a TikTok or others are doing because we think that there’s a certain type of entertainment — or moment of truth — that’s especially valuable to our members, and we really want to be focused there, versus trying to be all things at every moment, which I don’t think needs to be a core part of the strategy,” Stone added.\nAnother experiment involves podcasts, thanks to Netflix’s recent deal with Spotify to distribute podcasts on its platform.\n“We’ll use some of these new canvases we have, like vertical video, to start to experiment with new content types — and that includes something we announced more recently, which is podcasts,” Stone added, noting that some podcast content would be co-exclusive across Netflix and Spotify and would come to life on both mobile and TV. \nThe exec said users will see these experiments out in the next few quarters and throughout 2026.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nNetflix CTO Elizabeth Stone announced at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that the streaming service is branching out into immersive and interactive experiences, starting with real-time voting. The move marks a new way for the streamer to boost engagement, as it allows audiences of live shows to interact in real time.\nViewers will be able to vote while watching live content to directly influence the outcome of what they’re watching on their TV or mobile device. \nThe streamer started testing real-time voting on its live cooking show “Dinner Time Live with David Chang” in August and will roll out the functionality to its reboot of “Star Search,” a talent competition series that has been off the air for 20 years and is being brought back by Netflix next year.\n“If you’re sitting at home watching ‘Star Search’ on your TV, you’ll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn’t advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone said on TechCrunch Disrupt’s main stage on Tuesday. “So it’s just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they’re part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”\nViewers will be prompted on-screen and have a limited amount of time to rate performances. If you rewind or aren’t caught up with the livestream, you may miss the voting window. \nImage Credits:Netflix\nOn “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” viewers were asked to vote on whether they prefer tuna fish or grilled cheese. In another instance, they were asked if they think soups are better than salads. Viewers can see the results of the voting displayed on-screen.\nNetflix says it saw consistent engagement episode to episode in early testing of real-time voting, which it believes signals strong potential for more interactive entertainment in the future. \nThe streaming service says it’s focused on building toward more ways for viewers to feel involved in what they’re watching, which is why it’s working to allow for real-time responsiveness to content. At a time when Netflix is facing mounting competition from other streaming services, the company likely hopes that its new interactive functionality will create a shared, community-driven viewing experience for its members.\nIt’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time Netflix has explored real-time voting with its content, as the streaming service previously tested interactive viewer polls during its reality TV shows “Too Hot to Handle” and “Love Is Blind.”\nIn addition to Live, Netflix is focused on real-time responsiveness for formats like its new Party Games for TV, and, eventually, podcasts, so users can engage with what is happening in the moment.\n“There’s also a lot that’s exciting happening with cloud games, which introduces another similar kind of interaction pattern,” Stone said. “So we’ve got some fun living room party games launching in Q4 this year, more next year — for example, Boggle. So it’s on your living room TV screen. You’re able to do it with friends and family locally using your mobile phone. It’s another way to think about more immersive, fun, in-the-moment content, in addition to the more traditional film and TV, which, of course, we’ll continue to hit out of the park.”\nAlso on Tuesday, Stone announced that Netflix is launching immersive experiences on its homepage that the company says will bring its content to life through animation and dynamic special effects. To start, Netflix has launched a new Halloween Collection immersive experience. In the future, the company will debut a Holiday Collection in December and more IP-driven ones in the future, such as a “Bridgerton” one.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIndia’s free digital payments revolution has upended how money moves — but not how fintechs make it. Now, Flipkart’s fintech arm Super.money is partnering with Kotak811, the digital offering of one of India’s top commercial banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank, to change that, bundling UPI payments, savings, and secured credit into a single account aimed at turning usage into profit.\nThe partnership aims to issue about 2 million secured credit cards in the next 12 months — roughly 60 percent to first-time borrowers — and 5 million within 2 years. Super.money, which already serves 10 million active users, expects the Kotak alliance to contribute around 10 percent of its revenue next year as it works toward profitability by 2026, chief executive Prakash Sikaria said in an interview.\nIndia’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), backed by the Indian government, has made instant bank transfers free and ubiquitous, processing more than 19 billion transactions a month. That success, though, has left little room for fintechs to profit, since regulators, including the Indian finance ministry, do not allow the merchant fees that typically fund rewards and credit programs. Super.money’s bet — using a secured card and savings account to reintroduce incentives — offers a template for building viable business models atop no-fee payment systems.\n“We do UPI not to solve the pure payment use case,” Sikaria told TechCrunch. “We do UPI to build an interesting cross-financial services play where we are acquiring and retaining customers with the UPI.”\nLaunched in June 2024 as Walmart-owned Flipkart’s latest fintech venture after spinning off PhonePe in late 2022, Super.money is already generating about $3 million in monthly revenue, with an annualized run rate of roughly $36 million, the executive said.\nThe fintech app has emerged as one of India’s top five UPI platforms in recent months, processing more than 200 million transactions a month for four straight months through August, per the National Payments Corporation of India, the federal body that manages the system.\nAround 80% of Super.money’s revenue comes from personal loans, 10% from credit cards, and the remaining 10% from payment products such as bill payments and recharges. The fintech says it retains roughly 85% of users, with 60–70% of its transactions coming from customers under 30.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSikaria noted that Super.money’s business model rests on two monetization engines. “The first is the financial-services engine — personal loans, cards, deposits, and similar products — and the second is commerce,” he said. “Our idea is to bring a Klarna-style’ pay-in-three’ model on top of commerce, creating a financial overlay that lets customers buy now and pay later within the Super.money ecosystem.”\nThe partnership with Kotak Mahindra Bank, India’s fourth-largest lender by market capitalization, gives Super.money access to a large, regulated banking infrastructure. It follows an earlier tie-up with Utkarsh Small Finance Bank to specifically offer secured cards through its platform, marking the fintech’s move into mainstream retail banking.\nThe collaboration introduces what the companies call a “3 in 1 Super Account,” combining a savings account, UPI payments, and a fixed-deposit-backed secured credit card aimed at expanding credit access for first-time borrowers.\nImage Credits:Super.money\nTo open a 3-in-1 Super Account, users need to make a fixed deposit of at least ₹1,000 (about $11). The account earns interest on the deposit and offers a cashback on every transaction. It also includes a UPI-on-credit feature — a credit line backed by the deposit that does not require any income proof.\nSikaria told TechCrunch that secured cards were chosen as the anchor product because they fit within India’s zero-fee UPI system while still allowing the rewards and cashbacks that the platform was never designed to support.\n“Our focus is to bring in users who have a higher propensity to engage with our products,” he said. “UPI happens to be the core engagement and acquisition hook, but for people who don’t want to engage in financial services or other products that we launched, we do not want to serve them from a UPI or payment perspective.”\nThe partnership with Kotak Mahindra Bank comes soon after Super.money teamed up with SoftBank-backed Juspay to launch a one-click checkout experience for online merchants, aimed primarily at direct-to-consumer brands.\nAbout 1,000 merchants already use the solution, and Super.money plans to expand that network through partnerships with more D2C players and other companies within the Flipkart group, Sikaria said.\nThe secured card earns merchant discount revenue on transactions, and that funds the cashback, Sikaria said. “Obviously, there is a standard acquisition fee to the partner bank that we charge to the bank, so that comes as a monetization for us as well,” he added.\nSuper.money plans to issue about 200,000 secured cards a month under its partnership with Kotak before expanding to other banks, Sikaria said.\nSo far, Flipkart has invested about $50 million in Super.money to kick off its operations. As the business scales, the fintech plans to raise additional capital — possibly from external investors as well.\n“We need more capital for at least a couple of years,” Sikaria said. “Very soon, we’ll start formulating our capital-raise strategy.”\nHe declined to say whether the next round would come from Flipkart or outside investors but noted that Super.money is receiving inbound interest from “a lot of investors.”\nIn the meantime, Sikaria said the company is keeping its cash burn low, describing its current monthly burn as a “low single-digit million number” without providing specifics.\nHe added that Super.money is deliberately focusing on India’s top 10 to 30 million users, rather than competing with mass-market payment players such as Google Pay or PhonePe that target hundreds of millions.\n“What we want to do is build a formidable secured card franchise with a profitable P&L — for us, the bank, and our customers as well,” Sikaria said.\n"

    "description": "Security researchers found a government hacking campaign that relies on Windows spyware developed by surveillance tech maker Memento Labs. When reached by TechCrunch, the spyware maker's chief executive blamed a government customer for getting caught.",
    "body": "\nOn Monday, researchers at cybersecurity giant Kaspersky published a report identifying a new spyware called Dante that they say targeted Windows victims in Russia and neighboring Belarus. The researchers said the Dante spyware is made by Memento Labs, a Milan-based surveillance tech maker that was formed in 2019 after a new owner acquired and took over early spyware maker Hacking Team.\nMemento chief executive Paolo Lezzi confirmed to TechCrunch that the spyware caught by Kaspersky does indeed belong to Memento.\nIn a call, Lezzi blamed one of the company’s government customers for exposing Dante, saying the customer used an outdated version of the Windows spyware that will no longer be supported by Memento by the end of this year. \n“Clearly they used an agent that was already dead,” Lezzi told TechCrunch, referring to an “agent” as the technical word for the spyware planted on the target’s computer.\n“I thought [the government customer] didn’t even use it anymore,” said Lezzi. \nLezzi, who said he was not sure which of the company’s customers were caught, added that Memento had already requested that all of its customers stop using the Windows malware. Lezzi said the company had warned customers that Kaspersky had detected Dante spyware infections since December 2024. He added that Memento plans to send a message to all its customers on Wednesday asking them once again to stop using its Windows spyware.\nHe also said that Memento currently only develops spyware for mobile platforms. The company also develops some zero-days — meaning security flaws in software unknown to the vendor that can be used to deliver spyware — though, the company mostly sources its exploits from outside developers, according to Lezzi. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Memento Labs? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Kaspersky spokesperson Mai Al Akka would not say which government Kaspersky believes is behind the espionage campaign, but that it was “someone who has been able to use Dante software.”\n“The group stands out for its strong command of Russian and knowledge of local nuances, traits that Kaspersky observed in other campaigns linked to this [government-backed] threat. However, occasional errors suggest that the attackers were not native speakers,” Al Akka told TechCrunch.\nIn its new report, Kaspersky said it found a hacking group using the Dante spyware that it refers to as “ForumTroll,” describing the targeting of people with invites to Russian politics and economics forum Primakov Readings. Kaspersky said the hackers targeted a broad range of industries in Russia, including media outlets, universities, and government organizations. \nKaspersky’s discovery of Dante came after the Russian cybersecurity firm said it detected a “wave” of cyberattacks with phishing links that were exploiting a zero-day in the Chrome browser. Lezzi said that the Chrome zero-day was not developed by Memento. \nIn its report, Kaspersky researchers concluded that Memento “kept improving” the spyware originally developed by Hacking Team until 2022, when the spyware was “replaced by Dante.” \nLezzi conceded that it is possible that some “aspects” or “behaviors” of Memento’s Windows spyware were left over from spyware developed by Hacking Team.\nA telltale sign that the spyware caught by Kaspersky belonged to Memento was that the developers allegedly left the word “DANTEMARKER” in the spyware’s code, a clear reference to the name Dante, which Memento had previously and publicly disclosed at a surveillance tech conference, per Kaspersky. \nMuch like Memento’s Dante spyware, some versions of Hacking Team’s spyware, codenamed Remote Control System, were named after historical Italian figures, such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Galileo Galilei.\nA history of hacks\nIn 2019, Lezzi purchased Hacking Team and rebranded it to Memento Labs. According to Lezzi, he paid only one euro for the company and the plan was to start over. \n“We want to change absolutely everything,” the Memento owner told Motherboard after the acquisition in 2019. “We’re starting from scratch.”\nA year later, Hacking Team’s CEO and founder David Vincenzetti announced that Hacking Team was “dead.”\nWhen he acquired Hacking Team, Lezzi told TechCrunch that the company only had three government customers remaining, a far cry from the more than 40 government customers that Hacking Team had in 2015. That same year, a hacktivist called Phineas Fisher broke into the startup’s servers and siphoned off some 400 gigabytes of internal emails, contracts, documents, and the source code for its spyware.\nBefore the hack, Hacking Team’s customers in Ethiopia, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates were caught targeting journalists, critics, and dissidents using the company’s spyware. Once Phineas Fisher published the company’s internal data online, journalists revealed that a Mexican regional government used Hacking Team’s spyware to target local politicians, and that Hacking Team had sold to countries with human rights abuses, including Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, among others.\nLezzi declined to tell TechCrunch how many customers Memento currently has, but implied it was fewer than 100 customers. He also said that there are only two current Memento employees left from Hacking Team’s former staff.\nThe discovery of Memento’s spyware shows that this type of surveillance technology keeps proliferating, according to John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher who has investigated spyware abuses for a decade at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. It also shows\nAlso that a controversial company can die because of a spectacular hack and several scandals, and yet a new company with brand new spyware can still come out of its ashes, \n“It tells us that we need to keep up the fear of consequences,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “It says a lot that echoes of the most radioactive, embarrassed and hacked brand are still around.”\n"

    "body": "\nTutoring is one of the most effective tools for improving a child’s education, yet very few kids in the U.S. receive it. A 2023 survey of the nation’s largest school districts found that fewer than 10% of students received tutoring. One factor is that tutoring is too expensive for many families, often costing hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.\nTim Novikoff, a former Google product manager and educator, wants to change that. His startup, Super Teacher, offers an AI-powered tutoring app for elementary school students that costs $15 a month, or $10 with an annual plan. Super Teacher aims to make private tutoring accessible to families nationwide.\nThe four-year-old startup is gaining traction. Novikoff says roughly 20,000 families have signed up for Super Teacher, and public schools in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii now use the app. Super Teacher is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco.\nNovikoff was previously a math teacher in New York City, first in Harlem and then at a highly rated public school, Stuyvesant High School. In an interview with TechCrunch, he said almost all the students at Stuyvesant received tutoring, whereas many of the students in Harlem didn’t, and the difference in their educational experience was stark.\n“[Tutoring] is by far the most effective intervention that can be provided to kids for education, and it’s not even close,” Novikoff said. “It’s really unfair that not everyone gets this opportunity. That’s why I’m pursuing a mission to democratize access to private tutoring.”\nSuper Teacher’s app features animated tutors with AI-generated voices that guide students through interactive lessons. Students talk to the app using voice, like a conversation with a teacher. But unlike many edtech tools, Super Teacher doesn’t use large language models to generate responses. Instead, its content comes from a deterministic system designed to always give correct answers — avoiding the inaccuracies that can plague LLMs.\nNovikoff thinks AI tutors can have a valuable impact on children’s lives, but he’s adamant that AI will never replace teachers in a school setting. He refers to AI tutors as a tool that teachers can use, such as smart boards or calculators, rather than a replacement altogether.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSuper Teacher is only available for elementary school students, a decision Novikoff made to help his own children and because few edtech companies target that age group. Looking ahead, he hopes to expand to younger and older grades and partner with more school districts across the U.S.\nNovikoff previously founded Fly Labs, a mobile video-editing app acquired by Google in 2015.\nIf you want to learn more about Super Teacher from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nIf every good startup begins with a problem, this one may have begun with a bad Slack conversation. As CEO and co-founder Tom Bachant tells it, he remembers seeing the chaos of Slack-based support — the haphazard ticketing, the jumble of DMs, and little chance for insight into the underlying problems.\n“The first point was just seeing that Slack was this kind of chaotic beast that needed to be tracked better,” Bachant remembers, “and then seeing that the actual work that’s being requested by these teams could easily be automated.”\nHis new company, Unthread, is the result of that realization. The company builds Slack-native, AI-powered support bots for high-profile customers like Intuit, Lemonade, and Automattic. The goal is to fix a significant portion of issues automatically and forward the others into specific support tickets. But more than just a custom Slackbot builder, Bachant and his team think they’ve discovered a new way to track the problems that slow companies down — and fix them before they become a problem.\nUnthread is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. \nSometimes that means interoperating with ticketing systems like Jira and Zendesk — but just as often, it means replacing them. The flexibility of the AI-based model means Unthread can build systems just as well for HR, legal, or finance departments. And once Unthread is in place monitoring what problems are being reported from where, the team can start automating more tasks, ultimately creating a self-updating knowledge base for the whole company.\nA large part of that process is guided by contemporary AI tools, which sit at the core of Unthread’s tech stack, providing the flexibility to handle a wide variety of problems at scale. But an important part of Unthread’s value is just the basic organization of a ticketing system, applied to a modern enterprise communications platform. “LLMS have changed the way people use our product,” Bachant said, “but ultimately it hasn’t changed the problem that we’re solving.\nIt’s been a long road to this point for Bachant. His first startup, founded immediately after college, was a ride-sharing system called Dashride, meant to find drunk college kids a safe way home. After that company was acquired by Cruise in 2018, he founded an ill-fated HR startup before settling on the problem of Slack-based support. Now, he leads a lean 10-person team in New York, expanding Unthread’s powers while servicing clients.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs he tells it, the trick to that longevity is to stay focused on the people using your product. “We could only do this because we were having so many conversations with customers,” Bachant says. “Having that very clear picture of who the customer is, why they care about your product, why they might leave and use something else, has helped us to make a lot of decisions.”\nIf you want to learn more about Unthread from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

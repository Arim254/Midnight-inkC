Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday’s close.\nBy acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and web pages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools.\nIndeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data.\nSemrush has been investing in what it calls “generative engine optimization,” and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity.\n“Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don’t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we’re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n"

Once they turn 16, they will be able to access their old account as they left it.\nIt will be a challenge, however, for Meta to determine which users are under the age of 16, since people aren’t always truthful about their age when signing up for social media services. But digital age checks are notoriously difficult to execute in a manner that’s safe and effective. Identity verification services are high-profile targets for hacks, and the implications of even a minor security vulnerability are severe, since personal information and government documents can be exposed.\nIdentity verification platforms have already proven problematic for users’ security. Last year, 404 Media found that AU10TIX, a company that verifies the identity of users on TikTok, Uber, and X, had left administrative credentials exposed online for over a year, which allowed users’ sensitive information to be exposed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n"

    "body": "\nIf you want insight into just how worried VCs (and Silicon Valley, generally) are over legal challenges to AI training on copyrighted material, look no further than AI music site Suno. \nSuno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \nThe company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal. \nIt previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. \nBut Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  \nThose types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. \nBut given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. \n“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in their blog post about the investment.\nMenlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth — people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. \nNo doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.\n"

The navigation app is also launching an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature.\nNow, when users search for places in Maps like restaurants, hotels, or concert venues, they’ll see a new “know before you go” tips section that will surface important information about the place. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, what secret menu items are, what the best place to park is, and more. Users can click on each tip to get more information.\nThis “know before you go” tips section is rolling out now in the U.S. on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the updated Explore tab, Google has made it easier and faster to find trending spots near you. Users can now swipe up to see trending and popular restaurants, activities, and sights nearby, such as a new cafe that just opened up or a quirky art gallery around the corner.\nThe tech giant says it’s now also easier to find curated lists from sources like Viator, Lonely Planet, and OpenTable, in addition to local influencers.\nThe updated Explore tab starts rolling out this month globally on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAdditionally, the company announced that EV drivers can now see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination by searching for “EV chargers” in Maps. Google is using AI to analyze historical and real-time charger availability to predict how many chargers are likely to be free upon arrival. \nEV charger availability predictions start rolling out next week on Android Auto and cars with Google built-in.\nGoogle is also making it possible for users to leave reviews under a nickname, such as “Eager Elf” or “Julia Loves Sweets.” Reviews are still associated with a Google Account behind the scenes, so users can only leave one review per business. This prevents them from swapping out nicknames to leave the business a series of bad reviews — a practice known as review bombing.  \nWednesday’s announcement follows Google Maps’ recent integration of Gemini, which lets users ask about points of interest along their route, get answers on topics like sports or news, and perform tasks such as adding events to their calendar. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm, January Ventures, is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition.",
    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFrom electronic health records and blood tests to the stream of data from wearable devices, the amount of health information people generate is accelerating rapidly. Yet, many users struggle to connect this trove of data in a meaningful way and actually use it to improve their health.\nFunction Health, which offers a regular lab testing service to help people track their health, wants to change that by consolidating health data and making it usable for its customers by connecting that data to an AI model. To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. \nThe funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million.\nAlongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research. The company said the model is trained by doctors. For its customers, the company is offering an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on their health data and can tap their previous lab results, doctor’s notes, and scans to provide tailored guidance.\n“It is not good enough to be in a world where AI exists and not be applying it to your health,” Jonathan Swerdlin, CEO and co-founder of Function, told TechCrunch. “You should be able to manage your biology. The objective of Function Health is to apply the best available technology to human health.”\nSwerdlin noted the platform meets HIPAA standards, fully encrypts user data, and never sells personal information. “Your data and your identity are never for sale. Every bit of your information is fully encrypted and protected. We are committed to keeping you, and your data, safe.”\nFunction’s chief medical scientist, Dr. Dan Sodickson, and its co-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Mark Hyman, are together leading development of MI Lab and its team of doctors, researchers, and engineers. The MI model is trained by doctors and they stay involved in the process, Swerdlin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the space has many players, Function sets itself apart from competitors like Superpower, Neko Health, and InsideTracker thanks to its device-agnostic approach, Swerdlin said, adding that the platform integrates lab testing, diagnostics, and clinical insights to offer more than a typical AI coach or wellness app.\nFunction has 75 locations in the U.S. and members “can get lab tests done at 2,000 Quest locations”, he added. Function says it has completed more than 50 million lab tests since 2023.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that Function members can access tests at 2,000 quest locations. \n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nWarner Music Group (WMG) has settled a copyright infringement case with AI music startup Udio, the label announced on Wednesday. The two have also entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026.\nIn its press release, WMG said that the “next-generation music creation, listening, and discovery platform” will be powered by generative AI models trained on licensed and authorized music.\nThe company says the platform will create “new revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.”\nThe subscription service will allow users to make remixes, covers, and new songs using the voices of artists and compositions of songwriters who choose to participate. Warner Music Group says the platform will ensure artists and songwriters are credited and compensated.\n“We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “This collaboration aligns with our broader efforts to responsibly unlock AI’s potential — fueling new creative and commercial possibilities while continuing to deliver innovative experiences for fans.”\nArtists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more. \n“This partnership is a crucial step towards realizing a future in which technology amplifies creativity and unlocks new opportunities for artists and songwriters,” said Udio co-founder and CEO Andrew Sanchez in the press release. “Our new platform will enable experiences where fans can create alongside their favorite artists and make extraordinary music in an environment that offers artists control and connection.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement marks a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI.

Both platforms allow users to generate songs using AI-powered text prompts. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are also reportedly in talks to license their work to Udio and Suno.\nIn a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno announced earlier on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation.

    "description": "Autonomous electric tractor startup Monarch Tractor warned staff Thursday it may need to lay off more than 100 employees, or possibly even ‘shut down,’ according to a company-wide memo obtained by...",
    "body": "\nAutonomous electric tractor startup Monarch Tractor warned staff Thursday it may need to lay off more than 100 employees, or possibly even ‘shut down,’ according to a company-wide memo obtained by TechCrunch.\nThe memo comes after Monarch Tractor was already cutting some positions over the last few weeks at its California corporate facilities and remote teams in India and Singapore, according to multiple former employees who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity.\nMonarch Tractor was founded in 2018 by a team that included a former top executive at Tesla’s first gigafactory and Carlo Mondavi, a scion of the famous winemaking family. The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms.\nWhile Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company announced a restructuring in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech.\nAt least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, according to a lawsuit first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.)\nMonarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, earlier this year.\n“The new business plan will enable Monarch customers to launch fully commercialized software as a service (SaaS) autonomy and other software offerings direct to consumers, unlocking new revenue streams to OEMs,” the startup’s human resources team wrote. “Unfortunately, the timing for completing the transition to the new business plan puts Monarch at risk of shut down.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMonarch told employees in the memo it may permanently lay off “up to 102 employees.”\nIt’s unclear how many people currently work for Monarch. The startup had around 300 employees in late 2024 when it laid off more than 10% of the company as part of the restructuring. The former employees familiar with the recent cuts could not say exactly how large those layoffs were. Penmesta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThrough this year, Monarch Tractor has also lost some top talent, including the co-founder from Tesla, Mark Schwager. \n“We started Monarch with a daring vision: that farming could be electrified, automated, smart and made more profitable — all at once,” Schwager wrote in a LinkedIn post in July, while explaining he would remain on the company’s board. “Monarch is in great position and in great hands for the next leg of its trajectory – making the timing right for this transition.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang struck a bullish tone in the company’s third-quarter earnings. And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to.\nNvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations.\nThe revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive.\nNvidia’s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs.\n“This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said.\nBlackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company. \nHuang said sales of its Blackwell GPU chips “are off the charts.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Huang said in the company’s Q3 earnings statement. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”\nKress did note that the company’s shipments of H20, a data center GPU designed for generative AI and high-performance computing, were 50 million, a disappointing result due to its inability to sell to China.\n“Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,,” Kress noted on the earnings call. “While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America’s ability to compete around the world.” \nImportantly, Nvidia is forecasting more growth with a projected revenue of $65 billion in the fourth quarter, helping push its share price up more than 4% in after-hours trading. \nThe upshot, at least in Huang’s view: forget about the bubble, there is only growth. \n“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Jensen said during the company’s earnings call. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAuckland-founded Kiki Club launched its peer-to-peer subletting startup in New York City in 2023 with the mission of helping renters sublet their apartments while traveling for extended periods. \nHowever, Kiki’s model violated local short-term rental laws, leading to its shutdown this past June. The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay more than $152,000 to settle charges. \nBacked by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences.\nHowever, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. \nWhen the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data.\nAdditionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower.\nAccording to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. \n“This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki Club acted as a clandestine conduit for unregistered and illegal short-term rentals, directly undermining the city’s efforts to protect tenants and preserve permanent housing.”  \nWhile Kiki did not admit or deny the findings, it paid the penalties. A spokesperson for Kiki previously acknowledged in an interview with SmartCompany that the company was aware it was operating in a “gray regulatory area.”\nAnd, despite facing such significant consequences in New York, Kiki isn’t throwing in the towel. In June, the startup announced its launch in London. \nIt’s important to note that the U.K. also has regulations concerning illegal renting. Renting to someone who doesn’t have the right to rent in the U.K. can lead to up to five years in prison or a hefty fine.\nHopefully, the startup learned a valuable lesson in New York so its London-based platform doesn’t meet the same fate.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe explosive growth of data centers could threaten the stability of the electrical grid this winter, according to an industry overseer.\nAcross North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. \nData centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News.\nThe report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. \nAt the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.)\nThis year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up.\nStill, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work. \nBut as NERC notes, data centers tend to draw electricity consistently throughout the day. If a prolonged cold snap hits the state, keeping those batteries sufficiently charged to deliver power to all customers — data centers included — will become more challenging, NERC said. \nIf this winter passes without a significant storm, then NERC anticipates no problems with any region’s electrical grid. But over the last five years, there have been four severe storms, the organization said, which could force grid operators to import electricity, ask large customers to curtail their use, or as a last resort institute rolling blackouts.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The sanctions also target several of the company’s executives, including its general director — also known as Yalishanda — who allegedly provided servers and troubleshooting to cybercriminals.\nOfficials say criminal hackers relied on Media Land to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks. Prolific ransomware gangs, including LockBit, BlackSuit, and Play allegedly used it for their infrastructure. The Treasury said several of the company’s employees coordinated with cybercriminals.\n“Bulletproof” providers are web hosts and cloud companies that typically tout their services as impervious or resilient to law enforcement actions, such as takedowns or legal demands, and as such are commonly used by cybercriminals to host their malicious infrastructure. \nU.S. officials said hosting companies like Media Land help provide cybercriminals essential services for “attacking businesses in the United States and in allied countries,” though Treasury did not name the victims of the attacks.\nThe U.K.’s Foreign Office said it was also designating a U.K.-based company called Hypercore, which officials said was set up as a front company for Aeza Group, another bulletproof hosting company that was sanctioned by the U.S. in July. The U.K. said in its own statement that Aeza is linked to a Kremlin disinformation organization called the Social Design Agency.\nSanctioning the companies and individuals involved in cybercrime effectively makes it illegal for citizens, residents, or those with business ties to the U.S., U.K., and Australia from transacting or conducting business with those sanctioned.\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA and the National Security Agency published guidance Wednesday on how organizations can mitigate the risks from bulletproof hosting providers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nI guess we’re past the era of “and that’s what you missed on Glee.” Amazon’s Prime Video streamer is adding AI-generated “Video Recaps” to help viewers catch up between seasons of shows, the company announced on Wednesday.\nAccording to Amazon, the feature “utilizes generative AI to create theatrical-quality season recaps with synchronized narration, dialogue, and music.” It will begin rolling out in beta on Wednesday for select Prime Originals, like “Fallout,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” and “Upload.”\nPrime Video launched a similar AI-powered feature last year called “X-Ray Recaps,” which summarizes complete seasons, episodes, or parts of episodes — at the time, Amazon said that its AI model had guardrails in place to make sure that these recaps don’t inadvertently share spoilers.\nImage Credits:Prime Video\nConsumers have become accustomed to these kinds of text-based AI summaries, since they likely see them when their phone summarizes texts, or when they see a (perhaps unwanted) AI summary at the top of their Google results. But these video summaries veer into newer territory, which may appear more obtrusive in the viewing experience than text summaries — or, maybe they’ll be embraced by people who don’t remember what happened on “Bosch.”\nPrime Video’s competitors are also exploring how they can integrate generative AI into their products. \nYouTube TV, for example, uses a “Key Plays” feature to help viewers catch up on sports games if they start watching while the game is in progress. While it’s a bit imperfect (its algorithm seems to only be able to identify key offensive plays in baseball), the feature helped YouTube TV win its first Technical Emmy Award.\nNetflix, meanwhile, is using generative AI on the production side of its business.\nEarlier this year, Netflix said it used generative AI in the final footage for the first time in the Argentine show “The Eternaut” to create a scene of a building collapsing. After that, “Happy Gilmore 2” used generative AI to make characters look younger in the film’s opening scene, and the producers of “Billionaires’ Bunker” used it in pre-production to envision wardrobe and set design.\nThe use of AI in the film industry has sparked much debate, as artists worry that these tools — which sometimes are trained without permission on their work — could endanger their livelihoods. But some argue that tools that speed up tedious busywork in animation or special effects, like Wonder Dynamics, could expand the capacity for artists to create.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

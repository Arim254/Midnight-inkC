    "body": "<div>\n<p>An app called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/young-minds-app/\">Young Minds</a> wants to give parents control over what their kids do on the internet, while also protecting their children’s privacy and teaching them good online habits. </p>\n<p>The startup was founded by Nino Dvalidze (pictured), an entrepreneur and a mother of two from the United Kingdom. Dvalidze told TechCrunch that the idea for Young Minds came from conversations with fellow parents, who are also worried about how to keep their children safe, while also allowing them to have access to the internet, which, she admitted, is “enormously helpful in terms of education and exploration and connection with so many people outside of your immediate zone of contacts.”  </p>\n<p>Dvalidze explained that Young Minds, which will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>, has two versions: the parent app and the children app. The former gives certain control to the latter, allowing parents to set up screen time limits, to curtail certain content, but not the ability to monitor all communications on their kids’ devices. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">Disrupt runs October 27 to 29 in San Francisco</a>.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing safety as a minimum foundation,” Dvalidze said in a phone call. “We need to make sure that nothing that is not intended for the young eyes can reach them.” </p>\n<p>But the app is also designed to teach kids why certain content is blocked or why something is flagged as risky. Dvalidze said the app scans the child’s use of their tablet or phone with AI to detect and flag potentially harmful content, but the company does not store any user data. Parents can also use an in-app chatbot to educate themselves about the potential risks of certain sites or apps, she said.  </p>\n<p>Young Minds is available on Android. The iOS version will launch next week, but Dvalidze admits that because of iOS’s restrictions on what data apps can access from other apps, the version from Apple devices is a little different, albeit with “workarounds.” </p>\n<p>“We store some information with parent consent and analyze it,” she said, referring to a workaround they use on iOS.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>In terms of controlling screen time, Young Minds can be set up to turn on certain routines, as well as specific modes like “study mode,” which only allows education apps like Duolingo, or “wind down mode,” which restricts apps and usage that could interfere with their sleep.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Dr. Tom Kelly is a trauma surgeon, and everywhere, he sees doctors drowning in administrative work. He wanted change, so he set out to build it. </p>\n<p>“We wanted to build an AI care partner that would stand alongside clinicians and take care of the admin so that individual providers, like me, can feel empowered to deliver the care which we dedicated our lives to,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Dr. Kelly teamed up with Waleed Mussa, with whom he had worked at a previous startup, and founded Heidi Health in 2021. The company began launching products in early 2024. </p>\n<p>In just 18 months, he said, the company has returned more than “18 million hours to frontline healthcare providers from more than 70 million patient visits in 116 countries.” </p>\n<p>The product, as promised, is an AI medical scribe that takes care of all the admin work that hassles doctors. It can transcribe and dictate notes, generate personalized patient summaries, and even track tasks so doctors no longer have a need for sticky notes. </p>\n<p>Heidi both built its own AI model and builds on top of other models, such as Gemini. “This model agnostic approach means that we can optimize our accuracy, latency, and cost,” he said. </p>\n<p>On Monday, the company announced a $65 million Series B led by Steve Cohen’s Point72 Private Investments. It also announced a new tool: an AI agent that calls patients on behalf of the doctor. The former Chief Medical Officer at Microsoft, Dr. Simon Kos, is also coming on board, along with Plaid’s head of revenue, Paul Williamson. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The company has raised $96.6 million to date. Others in the round include Goodwater Capital, Headline, Blackbird VC, LG Technology Ventures, and Alumni Ventures. </p>\n<p>“They had seen all the scribes before,” Dr. Kelly said of Point72 Private Investments. “They’d never seen product adoption and usage metrics like they’d seen in Heidi. They also loved that we were obsessed about the end user experience, because they saw most of our competitors were just doing top-down sales.” </p>\n<p>The fresh capital will be used to help with product development. </p>\n<p>Dr. Kelly hopes that giving doctors more access to AI tools will expand the capabilities of clinicians and remove the “drudgery” of their work. </p>\n<p>He said most of the conversations in the medical world right now are shaped by what is happening in developed countries, “but imagine a world where any healthcare provider in the world can use Heidi to increase their clinical capacity, where they can practice in a war zone, or a refugee camp, or a region hit by climate change or simply an underserved community,” he continued. “Heidi can help them reach more patients and deliver better health care results.”  </p>\n<p>AI is transforming the health tech. Others in the medical scribe space, in particular, include DeepScribe, Ambience Healthcare, and Abridge. </p>\n<p>Heidi said it works with more than 2 million clinicians a week, ranging from hospitals to individual practices. It has a free version of the product with paid features, which Dr. Kelly believes has been a good lure for new customers. </p>\n<p>He said AI is understandably going to change everything in healthcare. But at its core, humanity is still very essential, especially when it comes to maintaining and building trust. </p>\n<p>“It’s about doubling the world’s health care capacity. That’s the true promise of AI,” he said. “We want to bring it about.” </p>\n<p><em>This story was updated to clarify the investment came from Point72 Private Investments</em>. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

I hear that works.”</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to dismiss this whole thing as another example of leftist infighting, especially since the Bluesky Discourse has already moved on to the question of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/katelynburns.com/post/3m2h2hpqdss2s\">whether “clanker” is a slur</a>.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Or maybe, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thelouvreof.bsky.social/post/3m2fuwkm3s223\">one satirical account suggested</a>, there’s just been “a week-long gas leak at Bluesky HQ.”</p>\n<p>But the controversy also underlines ongoing tensions between the company and some of its most vocal users. It’s a tension that could be seen last month in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\">skeptical responses to the company’s updated community guidelines</a>, and in recurring complaints that Bluesky has been too quick to ban Palestinian and trans users, while offering leniency to big accounts like Singal’s.</p>\n<p>It may be simplistic to reduce this tension to a single cause, but I suspect much of it comes from differing visions about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">what makes Bluesky special</a>: If you think it’s Bluesky’s community, especially that early community of marginalized users, then it can feel like a betrayal when Bluesky executives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bix.blog/posts/2025-10-03-on-waffles-and-class-allegiance/\">seem unwilling to stand up for those users</a>.</p>\n<p>One user who posts under the name Katie Tightpussy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/katie.bzky.team/post/3m2dyass2kc2x\">speculated</a> that Bluesky leadership has come to loathe “having a large social media app that they never wanted” and suggested that they spin it off so they can return “to Protocol Land where they never have to think about the opinions of plebeians ever again.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, when Graber isn’t responding to criticism with posts about waffles, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jay-graber-bluesky/\">she’s resisted identifying Bluesky with any specific group or political leaning</a>, instead emphasizing the decentralized protocol that allows users to build their own alternatives.</p>\n<p>Amidst the current controversy, she posted about “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2cuifnzds24\">decentralization acceleration</a>” and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7jc3k522t\">wrote</a>, “We’re system architects at core.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>AMD has signed a multi-year chip supply deal with OpenAI that could generate tens of billions in revenue for the chipmaker, helping accelerate its momentum in the AI industry. </p>\n<p>AMD has agreed to supply 6 gigawatts of compute capacity to OpenAI — enough to power up to 4.5 million homes <strong>—</strong> across multiple generations of its Instinct GPUs, starting with the Instinct MI450 GPU. OpenAI will receive the first gigawatt of capacity in the second half of 2026, when the new chip is scheduled for deployment. </p>\n<p>AMD claims the MI450 series will outperform Nvidia’s comparable offerings (NVIDIA Rubin CPX) through hardware and software improvements, many of which will be made with OpenAI’s input. Its current MI355X and MI300X series GPUs, currently used in some workloads for OpenAI, are already strong for AI inference in large language models due to their large memory capacity and bandwidth.  </p>\n<p>As part of the agreement, AMD has given OpenAI the option to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD stock, which amounts to a 10% stake. The first tranche will vest with the initial 1 gigawatt deployment, and additional tranches will vest as OpenAI buys up to the total 6 gigawatts, AMD said. </p>\n<p>OpenAI’s stake will also be directly tied to increasing AMD’s stock price milestones, with the final tranche vesting when the stock reaches $600 per share. For context, AMD shares closed at $164.67 on Friday, but started off Monday at $222.24, up nearly 35% following news of the deal.</p>\n<p>The deal comes as OpenAI works to secure as many chip partnerships as possible in its race to build out AI infrastructure, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">five new Stargate data centers</a> with a planned capacity of 7 gigawatts.  </p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to partner with OpenAI to deliver AI compute at massive scale,” said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO of AMD, in a statement. “This partnership brings the best of AMD and OpenAI together to create a true win-win enabling the world’s most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement that the partnership is “a major step in building the compute capacity to realize AI’s full potential.” This is the latest of several deals the AI giant has made in recent weeks to secure compute capacity.  </p>\n<p>Last month alone, Nvidia agreed to invest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">up to $100 billion in OpenAI</a> and supply the AI firm with at least 10 gigawatts; OpenAI and Broadcom also signed a $10 billion deal to develop and manufacture <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/openai-reportedly-planning-to-build-its-first-ai-chip-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">custom AI chips</a>; and OpenAI said its Stargate initiative with Oracle and SoftBank would be expanding.  </p>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-ropes-in-samsung-sk-hynix-to-source-memory-chips-for-stargate/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI struck agreements with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix</a> to source DRAM memory chips for the Stargate project and build data centers in South Korea.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

Sora’s most distinctive feature may be its “cameos,” where users can upload their biometric data to see their digital likeness featured in AI-generated videos.</p>\n<p>At the same time, users also seem to delight in flouting copyright laws by creating videos with popular, studio-owned characters. In some cases, those characters might even criticize the company’s approach to copyright, for example in videos where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">Pikachu and SpongeBob interact with deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1\">a blog post published Friday</a>, Altman said the company is already planning two changes to Sora, first by giving copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls.”</p>\n<p>The key word here appears to be “opt-in,” suggesting that OpenAI will stop users from creating videos with copyrighted characters unless studios and others rightsholders have actually given Sora permission to do so.</p>\n<p>“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Even with this new approach, Altman acknowledged there are likely to be “some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t.”</p>\n<p>The second change he mentioned is some unspecified form of video monetization.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>AI coding tools are getting better fast. If you don’t work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 4.5 did it again.  </p>\n<p>At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. If you are using AI to write emails, you’re probably getting the same value out of it you did a year ago. Even when the model gets better, the product doesn’t always benefit — particularly when the product is a chatbot that’s doing a dozen different jobs at the same time. AI is still making progress, but it’s not as evenly distributed as it used to be. </p>\n<p>The difference in progress is simpler than it seems. Coding apps are benefitting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. This is reinforcement learning (RL), arguably the biggest driver of AI progress over the past six months and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\">getting more intricate all the time</a>. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there’s a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input.  </p>\n<p>As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we’re seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can’t. RL-friendly skills like bug-fixing and competitive math are getting better fast, while skills like writing make only incremental progress. </p>\n<p>In short, there’s a reinforcement gap — and it’s becoming one of the most important factors for what AI systems can and can’t do. </p>\n<p>In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn’t break before they deployed it. So even the most elegant code still needs to pass through unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and so on. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\" target=\"_blank\">as Google’s senior director for dev tools recently told me</a>, they’re just as useful for validating AI-generated code. Even more than that, they’re useful for reinforcement learning, since they’re already systematized and repeatable at a massive scale. </p>\n<p>There’s no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. But not every task falls neatly into “easy to test” or “hard to test” categories. We don’t have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some testing kits will work better than others, of course, and some companies will be smarter about how to approach the problem. But the testability of the underlying process is going to be the deciding factor in whether the underlying process can be made into a functional product instead of just an exciting demo.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you’d asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s new Sora 2 model</a> shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Faces hold their shape, looking like a specific person rather than just a collection of features. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nunil1/sora_2_vs_veo_3_on_physics_test_sora_2_is_first/\" target=\"_blank\">obvious</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/pallavmac/status/1973141663557226806\" target=\"_blank\">subtle</a> ways. I suspect that, if you peeked behind the curtain, you’d find a robust reinforcement learning system for each of these qualities. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. </p>\n<p>To be clear, this isn’t a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It’s a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. But as long as RL is the primary tool for bringing AI products to market, the reinforcement gap will only grow bigger — with serious implications for both startups and the economy at large. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career. The question of which healthcare services are RL-trainable, for instance, has enormous implications for the shape of the economy over the next 20 years. And if surprises like Sora 2 are any indication, we may not have to wait long for an answer.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Agriculture is a thirsty industry, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/water-use-stress\">consuming 70% of all fresh water used worldwide</a>. In some countries, like India or Chile, it can be more than 90%.</p>\n<p>For Mario Bustamante, who lives in Chile, the problem hits close to home. “Lack of water is a big issue here,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Bustamante is betting that AI can help slash water use in farms across the world. His startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/instacrops/\">Instacrops</a>, was originally founded to deploy internet-of-things (IoT) sensors on farms to warn farmers about damaging frost conditions, but as the hardware became commoditized, the company pivoted to software and water use.</p>\n<p>Now, Instacrops is helping 260 farms cut their water use up to 30% while also increasing crop yields by as much as 20%. The company is part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a>, and it will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&display=\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> later this month in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>The switch from hardware to AI turned the company on its head, allowing it to operate with fewer staff and while processing more data. </p>\n<p>“We are processing — more or less — 15 million data points per hour. Almost 10 years ago, that was the amount for a year,” Bustamante said. “We’re reducing cost, team members, and generating more impact with less.”</p>\n<p>Instacrops can install new IoT sensors or connect to a farm’s existing network and collect data from them to advise farmers when to irrigate different areas. The startup’s LLM models ingest more than 80 parameters, including soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, crop yield, and NDVI, a plant productivity metric derived from satellite imagery.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Those advisories are sent to farmers’ mobile phones. Instacrops offers a chatbot app, but it also integrates with WhatsApp. “I think in the next year, we will be 100% WhatsApp because it’s a universal tool for any farmer,” Bustamante said</p>\n<p>On farms that are more technologically advanced, Instacrops can control irrigation systems directly, he said.</p>\n<p>Instacrops is focused on high-value crops in Latin America, including apples, avocados, blueberries, almonds, and cherries. Farmers pay an annual fee per hectare of farmland to gain access to the startup’s irrigation insights.</p>\n<p>The startup was a part of the Y Combinator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/instacrops\">summer 2021 batch</a>, and it has received investments from SVG Ventures and Genesis Ventures. </p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn more about Instacrops, and dozens of other startups, live and in person, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">don’t miss TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tesla has been hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI) for routinely denying or delaying customer claims despite years of warnings from the state regulator, according to <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/release064-2025.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">a new pair of filings</a>.</p>\n<p>Tesla’s insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in “willful unfair claims settlement practices” including “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps” of the process and “unreasonable denials,” CDI wrote. This has allegedly caused “financial harm” and “distress to policyholders.”</p>\n<p>CDI first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings, yet it claims things have only gotten worse. “In 2025, the Tesla Companies have already had more complaints, more justified complaints, and committed more violations than in the three previous years combined,” the regulator wrote. </p>\n<p>Tesla and State National could face penalties up to $5,000 for each “unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act” and up to $10,000 for each “willful” act, according to the filings. The companies have 15 days to respond. </p>\n<p>The enforcement action could have knock-on legal effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/teslas-auto-insurance-arm-hit-with-consumer-class-action-california-2025-07-17/\" target=\"_blank\">company purposely delayed and minimized claim payouts</a>. CDI wrote Friday that Tesla’s actions may have created “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla and State National did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Tesla launched its in-house insurance product in 2019. The idea was to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. But it got off to a rocky start. The website repeatedly crashed, and when it didn’t, it offered quotes that were far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20839607/tesla-car-insurance-broken-high-rate-quotes-california\" target=\"_blank\">higher than owners expected</a>. Still, Musk promised it would be a “revolutionary” product.</p>\n<p>Just three years later, according to CDI’s filings, the regulator noticed a “marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints” against Tesla. So in December 2022, CDI started meeting with Tesla and State National. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The regulator said it learned Tesla’s “Head of Claims” position had been vacant for months. It also accused the companies of not reporting the claims-handling problems.</p>\n<p>As a result, CDI subjected Tesla and State National to a sort of probationary period: the regulator monitored the companies’ efforts to reduce these violations for six months. Tesla and State National “conceded” that they had underestimated the volume of claims and the staffing required to handle them, according to CDI, and promised to beef up hiring.</p>\n<p>It took Tesla until April 2023 to hire a new Head of Claims. Through the rest of that year, Tesla and State National “reported improvements in the quality” of their claims handling and the “resolution of consumer complaints.” </p>\n<p>Later that year, Reuters published <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\">an investigation into Tesla’s insurance arm</a> that showed things weren’t so rosy. </p>\n<p>CDI came to the same realization in 2024. The regulator noticed a “significant increase” in both consumer complaints against Tesla and “violations of the law,” according to the filings. CDI had received just 83 consumer complaints against Tesla in 2022, but in 2024, that number jumped to 829. In 775 of those cases, CDI found Tesla had violated the state’s insurance code.</p>\n<p>Things have only gotten worse, according to CDI. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified 1,969 insurance code violations.</p>\n<p>In total, since 2022, CDI said Tesla has accumulated nearly 3,000 violations of state insurance law. The majority of those violations involve Tesla failing to respond to customers within the mandatory 15-day period. CDI said it identified 166 violations in which Tesla filed to conduct a “thorough, fair, and objective investigation” into a claim.</p>\n<p>“CDI repeatedly notified [Tesla] of its claims-mishandling issues and violations of law,” the regulator wrote. “While [Tesla] repeatedly committed to improvements, the number of justified complaints and violations continued to mount, demonstrating [Telsa’s] failure to correct its practices.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of package and car thefts. </p>\n<p>The popular internet-connected security camera maker <a href=\"https://community.eufy.com/t/help-improve-eufy-ai-earn-cash/4662267\" target=\"_blank\">said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems</a> to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.  </p>\n<p>“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.  </p>\n<p>“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.” </p>\n<p>Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”  </p>\n<p>This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.  </p>\n<p>Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/\" target=\"_blank\">a viral calling app</a> that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data</a>. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-videos-donated-to-train-ai\">Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI</h2>\n<p>Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.  </p>\n<p>The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.” Eufy users could participate by filling out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MnlPD7oI9yf9eb56ttG_otnMdFg60VwVHtlmtRDk6hJzkQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">a Google Form</a> where they could upload videos and their PayPal account for payment.  </p>\n<p>Eufy did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment and our questions, such as how many users participated in the campaign, how much money it paid those users, how many videos the company collected, and whether the company deleted the collected videos after training its AI systems.  </p>\n<p>Since then, Eufy has similar campaigns aimed at incentivizing its customers to send in videos to train their AI. </p>\n<p>As of the time of publication, through another in-app campaign that Eufy calls the Video Donation Program to improve its AI systems, Eufy also offers users rewards that range from an “Apprentice Medal,” which appears to simply be a badge next to the user’s name in the app, to gifts such as cameras or gift cards. </p>\n<p>Eufy is only asking for videos involving humans for this campaign. </p>\n<p>The Eufy app also shows an “Honor Wall” that ranks users who have donated the most video events. The leader of the ranking has donated 201,531 videos, according to the app.  </p>\n<p>In the app’s page for the donation program, Eufy clarifies that “donated videos are only used for Al training and improvement. Eufy will not provide the video to third parties.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?w=337\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=768,1550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=595,1200 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=634,1280 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=213,430 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=357,720 357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=446,900 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=396,800 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=761,1536 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=1015,2048 1015w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=331,668 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=186,375 186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=306,617 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=263,531 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Eufy/Anker (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Eufy also <a href=\"https://service.anker.com/article-description/How-to-Donate-eufy-Baby-Monitor-2-Videos-in-the-eufy-Care-App\" target=\"_blank\">asks users to donate</a> videos recorded with the company’s baby monitors.

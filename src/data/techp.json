We started the company in 2022 and launched the first product in 2023. It took us 20 months to reach $100 million in ARR, 10 months to reach $200 million, and five months to reach the current number,” he said. \nStaniszewski mentioned that both Fortune 500 companies and startups are adopting its voice agent technology, which uses company data and knowledge bases to power customer support and customer experience interactions. In a separate post on X, the company noted that enterprises have deployed its technology to handle more than 50,000 calls per month.\nThe startup raised $180 million in Series C funding co-led by a16z and ICONIQ Growth at a $3.3 billion valuation in June 2025. It then doubled its valuation three months later when ICONIQ and another earlier investor, Sequoia, shelled out another $100 million to snap up employee shares.\nBesides providing models for voice generation and voice agents, the company launched music creation capabilities last year and also struck a deal with celebrities such as Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to use their voices for AI-generated content.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Meta\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:21 AM PST · January 13, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nBrazil’s competition watchdog has ordered WhatsApp to put on hold its policy that bars third-party AI companies from using its business API to offer chatbots on the app. The agency has also started an investigation against the company to determine if the policy is anti-competitive.\n“According to the investigations, there is possible anti-competitive conduct of an exclusive nature that arises from the application of the New WhatsApp Terms (“WhatsApp Business Solution Terms”) imposed by Meta to regulate the access and offer, by providers of artificial intelligence tools, of its technologies to WhatsApp users,” the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE) said.\nCADE said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp.\nMeta last October changed its terms of use for the WhatsApp Business API to ban third-party AI companies from offering their chatbots on the app. Companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft soon after noted that after the policy goes into force from January 15, their chatbots would no longer be offered on WhatsApp. Notably, Meta’s policy does not stop businesses from offering their own chatbots, AI-powered or otherwise, within WhatsApp to their customers.\nCADE’s investigation comes after the European Union launched its own antitrust investigation into the new policy, as has Italy. If the EU finds Meta in breach of its antitrust rules, it could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. \nMeta has told AI providers that they can continue offering their AI chatbots to users in Italy even after the new rules go into force on January 15, according to a notice to developers seen by TechCrunch. The company could make a similar decision in Brazil following CADE’s order. \nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment outside regular business hours.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.\n“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said when the company changed the terms in October. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSmart rings, smart screens, smart TVs, smart pins, smart … ice cube makers? Sure, why not! AI was everywhere at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where companies large and small were showing off how they’re bringing AI to more devices. For Amazon, CES was a time to show off its newest acquisition in the space: Bee, an AI device that can be worn as a clip-on pin or a bracelet.\nAmazon already has an entry in the AI consumer devices space with Alexa, whose upgraded AI-powered version, Alexa+, can run on 97% of the hardware devices Amazon has shipped. However, with Bee, the company is gaining access to a wearable that could extend its reach outside the home.\nLargely designed for recording conversations like interviews, meetings, or classes, Bee also works as an AI companion. The AI has access to world knowledge, and it learns more about you from a combination of your recordings and the services you permit it to access like Gmail, Google Calendar, your phone’s contacts, and Apple Health.\nGiven that Amazon has already tried integrating Alexa into wearables like earbuds and glasses, it could seem like the company is muddying the waters with the addition of another AI companion. However, those earlier Alexa devices have not taken off in the face of competition like Apple’s AirPods and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Amazon seems to understand this, which is why it’s adding Bee to its lineup.\n“We see each other as complementary friends,” says Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo of Bee’s relationship with Alexa, in an interview at CES last week. “Bee has the understanding of outside the house, and Alexa has the understanding of inside the house. Of course, there will be a future where these two things come together.” \nThat future doesn’t yet mean Bee’s AI will be replaced by Alexa. Noted Amazon Alexa VP Daniel Rausch, Amazon thinks what the team at Bee created is an “important and lovable experience.” He describes Bee as a “deeply engaging and personal” AI, but he also agreed that, at some point, Alexa and Bee would come together.\n“We know that it will create even more benefit for customers than what [the AI experiences] do on their own,” Rausch explained. “When you have access to the power of these AI experiences with you throughout the day, and they’re continuous — we’re gonna be able to do so much more for customers.” \nDe Lourdes Zollo said that Bee learns from its users, gaining an understanding of their patterns, insights, and commitments, which can help it to suggest to-do items and follow-ups throughout your day. \nEarly use cases have included students who record lectures, elderly people who have trouble remembering things, and people who speak for a living and don’t want to always take notes manually. \n“They just want a place to have all the summarization of everything they said,” Bee’s co-founder said. “So based on that, we build a really big graph of knowledge [about] you, where you can go chat with Bee, and have an understanding of what happened to you, but also how you’re changing during the course of your life,” de Lourdes Zollo added.\nSimilar to Alexa, Bee uses a combination of AI models under the hood, but it’s exploring adding Amazon’s AI as one in the mix. After transcribing the conversation, Bee discards the audio, making it impractical for many work-related use cases where you need to play back the conversation to ensure accuracy.\nThere’s still much ahead for Bee in 2026, de Lourdes Zollo teased, without giving anything away. In addition to recent announcements of new features and functionality — like voice notes, templates, daily insights, and more — the founder said the eight-person team is working on “many new things” out of their HQ in San Francisco, where Amazon already has a large number of hardware and Alexa employees.\n“Honestly, it’s endless possibilities now, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re really excited to be part of Amazon,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

But Anthropic’s product promises more sophistication than ChatGPT Health, which seems as though it will be more focused on a patient-side chat experience as it rolls out gradually.\nThough some industry professionals are concerned about the role of hallucination-prone LLMs in offering clients medical advice, Anthropic’s “agent skills” seem promising.\nClaude has added what it calls “connectors” to give the AI access to platforms and databases that can speed up research processes and report generation for payers and providers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database; the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); the National Provider Identifier Standard; and PubMed.\nAnthropic explained in a blog post that Claude for Health could use its connectors to speed up prior authorization review, the process in which a doctor must submit additional information to an insurance provider to see if it will cover a medication or treatment.\n“Clinicians often report spending more time on documentation and paperwork than actually seeing patients,” Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said in a presentation about the product.\nFor doctors, submitting prior authorization documents is more of an administrative task than something that requires their specialized training and expertise. It’s something that makes more sense to automate than the actual process of administering medical advice … though Claude will do that as well.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPeople are already relying on LLMs for medical advice. OpenAI said that 230 million people talk about their health with ChatGPT each week, and there’s no doubt that Anthropic is observing that use case as well.\nOf course, both Anthropic and OpenAI warn consumers that they should see healthcare professionals for more reliable, tailored guidance.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAutomated investment platform Betterment has confirmed that hackers broke into some of its systems last week and accessed the personal information of an undisclosed number of its customers. \nIn an email sent on Monday, which TechCrunch has seen, Betterment said that hackers gained access to some company systems on January 9 by way of a social engineering attack, which involved “third-party platforms” that the company uses for marketing and operations. \nThe company said customer names, email and postal addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth were compromised in the attack.\nWith this access, hackers were able to send a fraudulent notification to users, claiming to triple the value of their crypto by sending $10,000 to a wallet controlled by the attacker, as reported by The Verge. \nBetterment, which allows customers to invest in crypto, also published an announcement about the breach on its website, but did not disclose how many customers were targeted, nor how many had their personal information accessed, stolen, or seen by the hackers. \nBetterment added that it detected the attack on the same day and “immediately revoked the unauthorized access and launched a comprehensive investigation, which is ongoing,” with the help of an unspecified cybersecurity firm. Betterment also said it has reached out to the customers targeted by the hackers and “advised them to disregard the message.”\n“Our ongoing investigation has continued to demonstrate that no customer accounts were accessed and that no passwords or other log-in credentials were compromised,” Betterment wrote in the email.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRepresentatives for Betterment did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details about the attack. \nAs of the time of publication, Betterment’s security incident web page contains a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which tells search engines to ignore the page, making it more difficult for anyone searching the web to discover information about the data breach.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nAmazon offered a bit more insight into how it sees its AI platform competing in the real world at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. Namely, Amazon plans to leverage the extensive footprint its devices already have in the home as well as consumers’ existing familiarity with its Alexa brand.\n“Ninety-seven percent of devices we ever shipped can support Alexa+,” noted Amazon Alexa and Echo VP Daniel Rausch in an interview at CES. He said the latest figures Amazon has on hand indicate the company has sold more than 600 million devices, and the “vast majority” will support its revamped AI assistant, Alexa+.\nAnnounced early last year, Alexa+ is Amazon’s future in the generative AI market, offering more expressive voices, access to world knowledge similar to other AI assistants, and AI agents that perform tasks on behalf of the customer — like calling an Uber or ordering food. The company has been steadily rolling out access to the AI platform, with more than 1 million Alexa customers gaining access by last June, and now, “tens of millions” can opt in to upgrade to the AI assistant.\nAmazon doesn’t have an exact date for when Alexa+ will be available to everyone; the company is focusing first on bringing the AI to all Prime members.\nWhat Amazon soon has to prove, beyond availability, is whether customers will actually use its AI. That’s where Rausch believes Alexa’s existing footprint will help. \n“I think that there’s going to be a whole range of AI out there for customers. I think that Alexa will be one of the foundational assistants,” he said. While he believes there will always be some specialist AIs on the market, like those that focus on one thing, like being a legal assistant, there will be a few “nameable, foundational AIs that are highly capable,” which is where Alexa slots in.\n“I think some of the advantages Alexa has is the familiarity of customers, the tens of millions of customers already engaging continuously,” Rausch said. “It’s in the home, ambiently available, in voice, in the most natural interface. I do believe that that’s our opportunity to grow,” he added.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlexa’s plans for the home come as Apple announced it’s teaming up with Google’s Gemini for Siri, as other AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Claude, compete across a variety of use cases ranging from research to healthcare to coding and more. \nJust ahead of CES, Amazon announced a way to access Alexa on the web and a redesigned Alexa app that puts a chatbot-style interface front and center. At the conference, Amazon partners like Samsung, BMW, and Oura showed off their Alexa integrations.\nThe company also promoted its recent acquisition of Bee, an AI wearable that lets you record conversations and gain insights. Customers can engage with Bee via text or voice chat.\nIn the future, Rausch says Alexa and Bee will become more integrated. But, he added, Bee has value as its own standalone brand, calling it a “an important and lovable experience.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.\nSalesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy product plan.\nHarris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.\nHarris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.\n“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”\nSalesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted not mandated in corporations.”\nThis is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.\n“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nWhen Justin Kim, co-founder and CEO of Hupo, first launched his company about four years ago, it wasn’t selling AI-powered sales coaching to banks, finance services, or insurance companies. The company originally began as Ami, a mental wellness platform focused on how people manage pressure, form habits, and change behavior over time.\n“I’ve always been a big sports fan – basketball, football, Formula One, MMA – and what draws me to all of them is performance. In my free time, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what actually drives human performance. People are very different, but across sports, there are clear patterns in how performance shows up,” Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nHis curiosity eventually shaped his professional focus. Kim started exploring what drives performance at work, and one theme kept surfacing: mental resilience. That idea led him to found a startup in 2022.\nEarly work with Meta, which backed this startup in the seed round, helped sharpen some hard-earned lessons: software only works when it fits into daily behavior like how people already live and work, and tools designed to help people “improve” often fail if they are judgmental, abstract, or disconnected from real work, Kim told TechCrunch.\nThose ideas followed the startup through its pivot, and today they shape Hupo’s approach to sales coaching; less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services.\nKim said the shift wasn’t as dramatic as it might seem. “The core problem in both cases is performance at scale. In banking and insurance, results vary, not because of motivation, but because training, feedback, and confidence differ. Traditional coaching can’t reach everyone, and managers can’t sit in on every conversation.”\nAI that understands conversations in real-time now allows teams to receive consistent coaching, even in the highly regulated, complex industry, Kim noted.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nimage credits: Hupo\nHupo has raised a $10 million Series A led by DST Global Partners, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Goodwater Capital, January Capital, and Strong Ventures. In addition, the Singapore-headquartered startup now serves dozens of customers in APAC and Europe, including Prudential, AXA, Manulife, HSBC, Bank of Ireland, and Grab.\n“BFSI [Banking, Financial Services and Insurance] is a notoriously difficult vertical for early-stage companies, but our customers typically expand contracts 3–8x within the first six months,” the founder said. “We’ll be expanding into the US in the first half of this year, where distribution-heavy financial models create a strong need for scalable coaching.”\nKim started his career at Bloomberg, selling enterprise software to banks, asset managers, and insurers, where he saw how complex regulated sales could be. He later worked on product development at South Korean fintech Viva Republica, the company behind Toss, learning how technology built around real user behavior could reshape traditional financial services.\n“Hupo sits at the intersection of those experiences. I understood the buyer, the end user, and the operational reality of selling financial products,” Kim said. “Once AI became capable of understanding context and coaching in real time, it became obvious to me that sales coaching—especially in banking and insurance—was the right place to apply it.”\nMany AI sales coaching tools start with the technology first, Kim said, but Hupo took a different approach, building its platform around how banks and insurers operate. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that, especially with large enterprises, you have to understand their business and industry in detail,” he added, noting that Hupo’s models were trained from the start on real financial products, common objections, client types, and regulatory requirements.\nThe latest round brings total funding to $15 million since the company was founded in 2022. The new capital will go toward expanding its product, including real-time coaching features, scaling enterprise-grade deployments, growing go-to-market efforts in banking, financial services, and insurance, and building out the team.\nIn five years, Kim says he wants Hupo to go beyond sales coaching and help large teams perform at scale, giving managers and employees clearer insights and practical guidance, even across tens of thousands of people.\n"

    "body": "\nWhen Meta announced capital expenditure projections last year, the company made it known that it planned to spend big to build out capacity for its AI business. “We expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences,” said Susan Li, Meta CFO, during an earnings call last summer.\nNow the tech giant appears to be making good on that promise. On Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Meta Compute, a new initiative designed to bolster the tech giant’s AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg said the company intended to drastically expand its energy footprint in the coming years.\n“Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads.\nFor reference, a gigawatt is a measurement of electrical power equivalent to a billion watts. The energy-hungry AI business means that America’s electrical consumption could spike exponentially over the next decade (from 5 GW to 50, according to one estimate).   \nZuckerberg has named three executives that he says will be spearheading the new project. One of those people is Santosh Janardhan, the company’s head of global infrastructure. Janardhan, who has been with the company since 2009, will lead work on “technical architecture, software stack, silicon program, developer productivity, and building and operating our global datacenter fleet and network,” Zuckerberg said.\nAlso involved is Daniel Gross, who joined the company just last year. Gross is the co-founder of Safe Superintelligence, along with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Zuckerberg said that Gross would be leading a new group within Meta that is “responsible for long-term capacity strategy, supplier partnerships, industry analysis, planning, and business modeling.”\nFinally, Zuckerberg said that Dina Powell McCormick, a former government official who recently joined Meta as the company’s president and vice chairman, would be responsible for working with governments to help “build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta’s infrastructure.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere’s obviously a race to build out generative AI-ready cloud environments, and Capex projections announced last year showed most of Meta’s peers had similar ambitions. Microsoft has been busy partnering with AI infrastructure providers wherever it can, and in December, Google parent company Alphabet announced the acquisition of data center firm Intersect. TechCrunch reached out to Meta for more information about the new initiative.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nEver since Ronald Reagan was president, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a value to human life. If you think too long about it, it’s a bit crass, but the upshot was to provide some cost-benefit analysis of pollution controls. Lowering pollution can prolong human life, so if the health benefits of reducing pollution outweighed the costs, then there was an economic argument to be made in favor of those reductions. \nEvery administration since has assigned some value to human life when determining how to regulate air pollution.\nThe Trump administration is planning to throw decades of accepted practice out the window, according to a report in the New York Times. If the EPA follows through on its plans, then it would no longer count the value of human health when regulating ozone and fine particulate matter pollution.\nThe risks of air pollution have been known for decades, which was part of the reason the EPA was founded under President Richard Nixon in the first place.\nOzone and fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, have long been linked to cardiovascular ailments like asthma, heart disease, and emphysema.\nOzone high in the atmosphere protects us against UV radiation. But when it forms close to the ground, as happens when oxides of nitrogen are emitted by everything from cars to power plants, it can create smog. On particularly smoggy days, it can be deadly to vulnerable populations.\nPM2.5 might be even more pernicious. Recent research has connected PM2.5 to a broader range of illnesses, including Parkinson’s, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. Even the tiniest, youngest infants aren’t spared, since a mother’s exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to low birth weight. Worldwide, as many as 10 million people per year die from fine particulate matter pollution annually. MAHA indeed.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe policy change comes at a time when data centers have been increasingly reliant on dirtier sources of electricity. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, used dozens of unpermitted natural gas turbines to power its Colossus data center near Memphis, Tennessee, a region the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America said was already an “asthma capital” due to pollution from transportation and industry.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is welcoming the Trump administration’s policy change. “We appreciate the efforts of this administration to rebalance regulations with a common-sense approach. We look forward to examining the proposal from E.P.A,” Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute, told the New York Times.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple services had a “record-breaking year,” according to a blog post by senior vice president Eddy Cue.\nIn 2025, Apple had 850 million average weekly App Store users (up from 813 million in 2024), over $100 billion in Apple Pay merchant sales, and a 36% increase in monthly Apple TV engagement.\nApple Music also had its best year ever for listenership and new subscriber growth, which is impressive amid Spotify’s longstanding dominance of the market.\nApple has less frequently disclosed figures about App Store payouts over the last several years, but the company shared that it has now paid $550 billion to developers since its launch in 2008. This indicates significant growth, as Apple last reported that as of 2021, it had paid out $260 billion to developers, up from the $200 billion it reported in 2020.\nThe App Store generally takes a 30% commission from in-app purchases, though it offers small businesses (developers making under $1 million annually) a reduced 15% fee. This section of Apple’s business has been the target of heavy regulatory scrutiny, with international courts investigating it for monopolistic practices.\nApple Music and Apple TV are growing\nApple’s entertainment products are making strides, too. Apple TV eclipsed all prior viewership records in December 2025, the company says, and Apple Music achieved record highs in listenership and new subscribers.\nApple TV’s growth comes alongside the debut of new hits like “Pluribus” and “The Studio,” as well as ongoing successes like “Severance.” Apple TV also struck major streaming deals with Major League Soccer and Formula 1. “F1,” Apple TV’s movie about the sport, became Apple Studios’ highest-grossing film yet, as well as the highest-grossing film of star Brad Pitt’s career.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple credits its karaoke-like “Sing” feature, partnerships with companies like GM and Chase, and other new developments for its growth. It notes that Shazam generated over 1 billion recognitions per month, which could have funneled growth into its Music service. \nBut it’s also possible that Apple benefited from controversy around Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s business ventures.\nEk’s investment firm led a €600 million investment in European defense tech company Helsing, which makes AI-powered military software and strike drones. Artists like Xiu Xiu, Sylvan Esso, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof, and others removed their catalogs from Spotify in protest.\nSpotify has faced other controversies over the last several years, from its platforming of COVID-19 misinformation via Joe Rogan’s podcast (formerly a Spotify exclusive) to its artist payout metrics.\nOn the other hand, Apple Music could be growing because it’s simply making a product that is better suited for some listeners (I wrote about my decision to switch from Spotify to Apple Music as I became increasingly suffocated by algorithmic recommendations).\nIt could also be a financial decision amid uncertain economic times — Apple Music lures new subscribers with its three-month free offer, which comes alongside the purchase of most new Apple devices.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Anthropic\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11:30 AM PST · January 12, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nOn Monday, Anthropic announced a new tool called Cowork, designed as a more accessible version of Claude Code. Built into the Claude Desktop app, the new tool lets users designate a specific folder where Claude can read or modify files, with further instructions given through the standard chat interface. The result is similar to a sandboxed instance of Claude Code, but requires far less technical savvy to set up.\nCurrently in research preview, Cowork is only available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist available for users on other plans.\nThe new tool is inspired in part by the growing number of subscribers using Claude Code to achieve non-coding tasks, treating it as a general-purpose agentic AI tool. Cowork is built on the Claude Agent SDK, which means it’s drawing on the same underlying model as Claude Code. The folder partition gives an easy way to manage what files Cowork has access to, and because the app doesn’t require command-line tools or virtual environments, it’s less intimidating for non-technical users.\nThat opens up a new world of potential use cases. Anthropic gives the example of assembling an expense report from a folder of receipt photos — but Claude Code users have also put the system to work managing media files, scanning social media posts, or analyzing conversations.\nSimilar to Claude Code, Cowork is designed to take strings of actions without user input — a potentially dangerous approach if the tool is given vague or contradictory instructions. In a blog post announcing the new tool, Anthropic explicitly warns about the risk of prompt injection or deleted files, recommending that users make instructions as clear and unambiguous as possible.\n“These risks aren’t new with Cowork,” the post reads, “but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation.”\nLaunched as a command-line tool in November 2024, Claude Code has become one of Anthropic’s most successful products, leading the company to launch a string of new interfaces in recent months.

    "body": "\nUsage of voice AI in sales, marketing, customer support, and consumer applications has shot up in the last few years. As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, Deepgram said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion dollar valuation. \nThe round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. \nThe startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including Seasame’s $250 million Series B, ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C, and Gradium’s $70 million seed round. \nElizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.\n“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales development. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” Saint-Aignan said. \nShe noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. \nDeepgram has a bunch of models related to text-to-speech and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.\n“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.\n“We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”\nThe company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y-Combinator-backed Ofone, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell withdrew its voice AI experiment after a person ordered 18,000 water cups. \n“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.\nThere seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up $10 million in new funding.\nAnalysts’ reports peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

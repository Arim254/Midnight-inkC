    "body": "\nIn 2023, after nearly three decades as CEO of the company he founded, Robert LoCascio stepped down as CEO of LivePerson, the public firm credited with pioneering web chat in 1997.\nGenerative AI advances inspired his next project, which he calls “the highest bar” for the technology: replicating human beings with their life stories and personality. In 2024, he founded and self-funded, Eternos, a legacy service that allows people to preserve their voice and stories for loved ones after they pass away. Now, it’s got a new name and modified mission. \nThe startup gained significant media attention after its first client, the terminally ill Michael Bommer, revealed how he worked with Eternos to create a digital replica of himself after spending 25 hours talking to Eternos about his life, interests, and worldview.\nLo Cascio was set on building a legacy business, but what surprised him was that most of the people considering using Eternos weren’t preparing for death.\nEternos developed the Human Life Model (HLM) — a framework that uses only an individual’s data, rather than general LLM data, to capture their unique values, life story, and decision-making traits. LoCascio saw an opportunity to use this technology to help individuals create personal AIs for professional and personal use.\nThe company announced Tuesday it has rebranded as Uare.ai and raised $10.3 million in seed funding led by Mayfield and Boldstart Ventures.\n“I started to realize that the big models, they’re taking our datasets, and they’re getting smarter because of us,” LoCascio told TechCrunch. “We don’t have to take that path. You own the model, and you can share it and monetize it.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe vision for Uare.ai is to be a scaling tool for creators and professionals. Since the personal AI models hold the individual’s full expertise, a digital replica can be put to work to generate content, handle customer interactions, and even execute projects.\nOnce Uare.ai’s platform launches later this year, individuals will be able to start training their HLMs by responding to Uare.ai questions about their lives using text, voice, and even video.\n“The first part is getting a human life story. Where’d you come from? Tell me a story about your childhood. What’s a crossroad in your life when you were younger?” LoCascio said.\nUare.ai then asks the person to submit additional facts about their life, including information about their profession. “We blend the facts with this human life story, and that gives us your model,” he said.\nUnlike Character.ai and other chatbots, Uare.ai’s model won’t turn to general LLMs to fill the gaps about anything that’s not in HLM. “Our AIs will say, I don’t know if they can’t answer the question,” LoCascio said.\nUare.ai intends to generate revenue through subscription fees or take a share of the revenue generated by customers who earn income from their digital twins.\nAnother startup developing personal AIs is Sequoia-backed Delphi, which has attracted people with large followings, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, and enables others to interact with his replicated knowledge via voice or text.\nNavin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield, believes Uare.ai stands out from competitors because it targets individual professionals like CPAs. Plus, it has LoCascio, a very successful entrepreneur at the helm, he told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMasayoshi Son isn’t known for half measures. The SoftBank founder’s career has been studded with brow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last. His latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion NVIDIA stake to go all-in on AI, and while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it’s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn’t push his chips to the center of the table.\nConsider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son’s net worth soared to approximately $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally – which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history — as SoftBank’s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion. \nBut amid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth $150 billion by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry’s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.\nThat Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn’t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley. After journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as “horrific and deeply regrettable” but insisted SoftBank couldn’t “turn our backs on the Saudi people,” maintaining the firm’s commitment to managing the kingdom’s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.\nThat didn’t turn out so well. A big bet on Uber generated paper losses for years. Then came WeWork. Son overrode his lieutenants’ objections, fell “in love” with founder Adam Neumann, and assigned the co-working company a dizzying valuation of $47 billion in early 2019 after making several previous investments in the company. But WeWork’s IPO plans collapsed after it published a famously troubling S-1 filing. The company never quite recovered – even after pushing out Neumann and instituting a series of belt-tightening measures – ultimately costing SoftBank $11.5 billion in equity losses and another $2.2 billion in debt. (Son reportedly later called it “a stain on my life.”)\nBut Son has been mounting another comeback for years, and Tuesday will undoubtedly be remembered as an important moment in his turnaround tale. Indeed, it will likely be recalled as the day SoftBank sold all 32.1 million of its NVIDIA shares – not to diversify its bets but instead to double down elsewhere, including on a planned $30 billion commitment to OpenAI and to participate (it reportedly hopes) in a $1 trillion AI manufacturing hub in Arizona. \nIf selling that position still gives Son some heartburn, that’s understandable. At approximately $181.58 per share, SoftBank exited just 14% below NVIDIA’s all-time high of $212.19, which is a strong look. That’s remarkably close to peak valuation for such a huge position. Still, the move marks SoftBank’s second complete exit from NVIDIA, and the first one was exceedingly costly. (In 2019, SoftBank sold a $4 billion stake in the company for $3.6 billion, shares that would now be worth more than $150 billion.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move also rattled the market. As of this writing, NVIDIA shares are down nearly 3% following the disclosure, even as analysts emphasize that the sale “should not be seen as a cautious or negative stance on Nvidia,” but rather reflects SoftBank needing capital for its AI ambitions.\nWall Street can’t help but wonder: does Son see something right now that others do not? Judging by his track record, maybe — and that ambiguity is all investors have to go on.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s competitor to X, will now begin targeting a specific type of creator: podcasters. The company said on Tuesday that Threads will focus on bringing more discussions around podcasts to its app and helping creators promote their shows.\nInitially, Threads will roll out a couple of new features to help on this front. For one, it will give podcast links in the feed a unique and more pronounced look, with colorful backgrounds and image thumbnails, making them easier to spot.\nCreators, meanwhile, will get a dedicated spot in their user profile to add a link to their podcast. Threads says these links, which are similarly designed to stand out, will help podcasters better promote their shows and grow their audiences.\nIn the year ahead, these features will be followed by others that will also focus on serving podcasters and their listeners, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Threads\nMeta explained it’s interested in the podcast community because it sees the potential in becoming the de facto place for people to talk about shows and engage with creators. Today, such discussions are distributed across social media, on places like Reddit, X, Facebook and Instagram, as well as on the platforms where podcasts are streamed, like YouTube and Spotify (the latter added support for comments last year).\nThe company’s also trying to tap podcasts’ deep ties to culture, which can drive discussions and encourage interactions. Threads currently has more than 400 million monthly active users and 150 million daily active users, less than its rival X, which claims as many as 600 million monthly active users. Capturing the podcast community, or even a portion of that, could help to narrow that gap significantly.\nImage Credits:Threads\nHowever, while Threads will target the discussions that result from podcasts, the company told TechCrunch it doesn’t intend to be a podcast distribution platform. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInstead, the company will focus on giving podcast hosts more insight and analytics on how the conversations around their shows are resonating with fans. It also intends to develop more features that would help people discover podcasts they might like, and connect podcasters and listeners through conversations.\nThis isn’t the first time Threads has targeted creators as a way to differentiate its social network from X, Bluesky, and others in the space.\nImage Credits:Threads\nThe company in May gave creators the ability to add up to five links in their profile, allowing them to promote their broader presence across the web, including on other social media sites, video platforms, blogs, and portfolios. The company more recently also began allowing creators to share longer thoughts and perspectives through a text attachment feature.\nMeta says users can expect to see Threads explore more features focused on podcast discussions in the months ahead.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIsraeli AI agent startup Wonderful has raised $100 million in a Series A round led by Index Ventures, with participation from Insight Partners, IVP, Bessemer, and Vine Ventures. \nThe large round, in a market already crowded with AI agent startups, suggests Wonderful has convinced top tier investors it’s not just another GPT wrapper, but a company building the infrastructure and orchestration that could scale if multi-agent systems take off.  \nThe round brings Wonderful’s total funding to $134 million just four months after the startup came out of stealth with a seed round and a promise to help enterprises deploy customer-facing AI agents across voice, chat, and email in every market and every language. The startup says it tailors the platform to each market it serves, fine-tuning for language, cultural norms, and regulatory environments, and even organizes local teams to manage deployment.  \nThat approach has led to rapid growth for the young startup, which claims its AI agents are already managing tens of thousands of customer requests daily with an 80% resolve rate. Since launching, Wonderful has expanded to Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Greece, Poland, Romania, the Baltics, the Adriatics and the UAE. \nWith its fresh funding, Wonderful intends to launch in Germany, Austria, the Nordics and Portugal in 2025, and plans to expand in the Asia-Pacific region in early 2026. But the company doesn’t intend to stop with customer support agents. \nSince its system plugs deeply into an enterprise customer’s existing software and can be tailored for each market, the startup says it will be able to give agents the capabilities to perform new tasks with minimal extra effort. It is currently exploring areas like employee training, sales enablement, regulatory compliance, internal IT support, and onboarding, the company said. \n“The promise of AI agents is clear, but putting that into practice, and critically, into production, is a huge challenge,” Bar Winkler, CEO and co-founder of Wonderful, said in a statement. “It requires marrying best-in-class technology together with flawless delivery, on the ground with customers. That’s been our approach with Wonderful, and it’s what has driven the accelerated adoption we’ve seen across markets in the last few months.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCustomer-facing AI agents are emerging as the first real beachhead for the technology, and investors were likely attracted by Wonderful’s focus here. These use cases help enterprises cut costs by augmenting or replacing human support staff, and they integrate readily into existing call centre infrastructure. Crucially, they also carry less risk than having an AI make internal decisions autonomously — a use case that most enterprises aren’t ready to adopt at scale yet.  \nIndex Ventures partner Hannah Seal pointed to Wonderful’s ability to “[move] from concept to global scale in less than a year” as a source of confidence for investors. The company’s true edge, she said, is its ability to deploy agents for global enterprises that function across every market and language. \nJeff Horing, co-founder and managing director at Insight Partners, said the adoption Wonderful is seeing across industries shows “just how valuable culturally fluent agents can be.” \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nFor all their pitches promising something new, AI startups share many of the same questions as startups in years past: How do they know when they’ve achieved the holy grail of product-market fit?\nProduct-market fit has been studied extensively over the years; entire books have been written about how to master the art. But as with so many things, AI is upending established practices.\n“Honestly, it just could not be more different from all the playbooks that we’ve all been taught in tech in the past,” Ann Bordetsky, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, told a standing room-only crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. “It’s a completely different ball game.”\nTop of the list is the pace of change in the AI world. “The technology itself isn’t static,” she said.\nEven still, there are ways that founders and operators can evaluate whether they have product-market fit.\nOne of the best things to watch, Murali Joshi, a partner at Iconiq, told the audience, is “durability of spend.” AI is still early in the adoption curve at many companies, and so much of their spend is focused on experimentation rather than integration. \n“Increasingly, we’re seeing people really shift away from just experimental AI budgets to core office of the CXO budgets,” Joshi said. “Digging into that is super critical to ensure that this is a tool, a solution, a platform that’s here to stay, versus something that they’re just testing and trying out.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nJoshi also suggested startups consider classic metrics: daily, weekly, and monthly active users. “How frequently are your customers engaging with the tool and the product that they’re paying for?”\nBordetsky agreed, adding that qualitative data can help provide nuance to some of the quantitative metrics which might suggest, but not confirm, whether customers are likely to stick with a product. \n“If you talk to customers or users, even in qualitative interviews, which we do tend to do a lot early on, that comes through very clearly,” she said.\nInterviewing people in the executive suite can be helpful, too, Joshi said. “Where does this sit in the tech stack?” he suggests asking them. He said that startups should think about how they can make themselves “more sticky as a product in terms of the core workflows.”\nLastly, it’s important for AI startups to think about product-market fit as a continuum, Bordetsky said. Product-market fit is not sort of one point in time,” she said. “It’s learning to think about how you maybe start with a little bit of product market fit in your space, but then really strengthen that over time.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

In addition, the product’s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization’s nonprofit mission.\nWhile the post doesn’t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to “evade detection.” Meanwhile, it said that “human page views” had declined 8% year-over-year.\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n“For people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,” the post reads. “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.”\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more. \nFor example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations. \nOr, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nGoogle says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.\nFor example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says. \nTo access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button. \nGoogle says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move comes as Google announced back in September that it was introducing Gemini for Google TV to select TCL devices.

For instance, “Remove Riley’s sunglasses, open my eyes, make Engel smile, and open her eyes” to get edits related to each person, as the image below shows.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company is adding its popular AI image model, Nano Banana, to Google Photos to let users edit their photos to recreate images in new styles like a Renaissance portrait or cartoon strip. \nGoogle is also adding AI templates to easily let users convert one photo into a specific format. With Nano Banana, formats like turning images into retro portraits or action figures became popular. The company said this feature will roll out next week on Android under the Create tab in the U.S. and India, where Nano Banana is used the most.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle Photos is also getting a slight design change with a new Ask button that will act as a starting point for different AI requests.

    "body": "\nKaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker’s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a “very leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he’s an expert [in this field], and that’s what we bought,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n“This acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation — not just video-on-demand lip-syncing — and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,” Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Beyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that’s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly — hyper-personalized and contextual — giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n“We started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf’s technology, we’re adding human-like capabilities — faces, eyes, mouths, ears — to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a “face,” it delivers the full workflow — avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn’t just streaming video; it’s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential “acquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.” But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura’s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to its current strategy.\nThis marks Kaltura’s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf’s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024. \nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.\n"

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy, and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow, she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nRaising a $250 million Series D round may seem like a distant and unnecessary distraction to startup founders pitching investors for that first $1 million in seed money. But it shouldn’t be, according to several founders and venture capitalists. In their view, founders should be charting out a strategy for those later stage fundraises from the beginning. \nAven co-founder and CEO Sadi Khan said, while on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, startup founders should start thinking about their later rounds before they raise their first financing. This strategy allows founders to determine how much capital they’ll likely need throughout the growth of their startup. \n“We’re a very capital-intensive company; we provide asset-backed credit cards to consumers,” Khan said. “We require large amounts of capital to scale up, and we’ll require large, large amounts of capital to grow. From day zero, we knew that we needed to have an intensive pipeline of investors that we want to work with over a long period of time.”\nFounders who understand how much capital they need can focus on finding the right investors for an early-stage round while building relationships with later-stage investors of the same flavor.\nLila Preston, head of growth equity at Generation Investment Management, said startups should start building these relationships at least two years before they need the capital.\nStarting these relationships early gives investors time to get to know the business and the market it operates in, Preston added. It also gives investors a peek into the company’s growth. \nSome later-stage investors — like Generation Investment Management, Preston said — can add value to a company long before they invest, if they think an idea is promising.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“When we show up, even at Series A or B, we’ve done the homework so that we’re an additive worthwhile conversation,” Preston said. “‘What are your milestones?’ ‘What does success look like to you?’ As the entrepreneur, [if you are] able to articulate that, you can come back and say, ‘yes, you’ve been able to hit the milestones you set out.’”\nZeya Yang, a partner at IVP, agreed and added that later-stage rounds are closing quicker than ever. Giving investors time to learn about your company in advance helps both sides, Yang noted.\n“It definitely helps to get to know those people earlier than you think you need to,” Yang said. “When you’re actually raising, you’re talking to folks, one that you know you probably get along with, two who’ve already thought about your business a bit, etc. So it’s definitely helpful to think about it well in advance.”\nYang added that when early-stage companies start talking to later stage investors they don’t have to necessarily share all their numbers or metrics quite yet. Instead, they can share the general direction of the company and the overall vision of what it’s building.\nStartups looking to find these late-stage investors should start by turning to their existing cap table, Khan said. A company’s existing investors can connect the founder to other VCs — his early investors introduced him to Khosla Ventures which led the company’s Series E round — that would be a good fit or have worked well the investors on the cap table in the past.\n“At any given stage of fundraising, we always thought about what the next set of investors would be,” Khan said. “We try to build relationships in the previous round with an investor who really focuses on the next stage round. And sometimes we would let them come in on like a symbolic check to really start establishing a relationship.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

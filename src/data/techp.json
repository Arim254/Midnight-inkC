    "description": "Revolut's full banking license is on hold because U.K.'s central bank is concerned whether the startup can maintain its risk controls in the face of its rapid international expansion.",
    "body": "\nU.K. fintech Revolut has hit yet another roadblock to its longstanding mission of becoming a real bank in its home country: Its full banking license is on hold because the country’s central bank is concerned over whether the startup can maintain its risk management controls in the face of its blazing fast international expansion.\nThe Bank of England wants Revolut to commit to building its risk management stack to match its international growth before the regulator can approve a full banking license, while the Prudential Regulation Authority is investigating the fintech’s controls in the U.K. and internationally, according to the Financial Times.\nRevolut got approval to receive a banking license in the U.K. more than a year ago, but is still in the so-called “mobilization” stage. This phase typically lasts 12 months and imposes deposit restrictions while a bank completes the final steps of setup and the Prudential Regulation Authority or Financial Conduct Authority assess whether it is ready to fully operate as a full-fledged bank.\nImportantly, having a full banking license would allow Revolut to start lending in the U.K., and hold more than £50,000 in customer deposits. The company has 12 million customers in the U.K.\nNews of the delay comes as Revolut, with more than 65 million customers worldwide, has moved aggressively to expand beyond Britain. The company already has a banking license in the European Union, and it operates in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. Just last week, it launched operations in India; it is also about to start operating in Colombia in 2026, has plans to launch in Argentina and Mexico, wants to enter Africa (first with South Africa), and has an in-principal payments license in the UAE.\nThe company has grand ambitions, aiming to reach 100 million customers by mid-2027, and enter over 30 new markets by 2030.\n“We are progressing through the final stages of mobilization and continue to work constructively with the PRA,” a Revolut spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Given Revolut’s global scale, this is the largest and most complex mobilization ever undertaken in the U.K. A thorough review is an expected part of the process, and getting this right is more important than rushing to meet a specific date.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPer its last annual report, Revolut reported net profit of $1 billion (£790 million) in 2024, while revenues increased 72% to $4 billion (£3.1 billion) in the year. The company also launched a crypto exchange, Revolut X, part of its Wealth division, which saw revenue rise 298% to $647 million in 2024 from just $158 million in 2023.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nFarewell, V2: SpaceX on Monday night sent Starship’s current configuration on one last test flight, in a mission that the company says hit all its key goals, moving the program into its next phase.\nThe nearly 400-foot-tall rocket lifted off from Starbase, Texas at 6:23 PM local time. The Super Heavy booster, reused from a March test, tried a new landing-burn profile, reigniting 13 engines before throttling down to five, and finally three for the final hover before completing a planned soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico roughly seven minutes after liftoff.\nMeanwhile, Starship’s upper stage deployed eight mock Starlink satellite simulators, trialing a new “dynamic banking maneuver” profile that the company aims to use for future return-to-pad attempts at Starbase. The upper stage then splashed down in the Indian Ocean.  \nThis marked the final launch of the second-gen Starship and the first-gen Super Heavy variants. As with the previous test flight, engineers also experimented with the heat shield tiles on the upper stage, including selective removals and novel tile variations to gather reentry data.\nSpaceX also duplicated Flight 10’s other key milestones: deploying simulators, and relighting one of Starship’s six Raptor engines on orbit.\nMonday’s test formally started the program’s next phase: flying an upgraded prototype called V3, outfitted for in-orbit docking and propellant-transfer demonstrations, capabilities essential for crafts that aim to reach the Moon and Mars. SpaceX says V3 also incorporates structural changes and upgrades to the Raptor engine that are aimed at increasing lifting capacity, though the company did not share specific figures.\n“This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer, and more as we iterate to a fully and rapidly reusable vehicle with service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond,” the company said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn parallel, SpaceX is upgrading Pad A at Starbase, and shifting launches to Pad B. The company is simultaneously working to build dual Starship launch pads in Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\nStarship is the most powerful rocket ever developed. It’s also the cornerstone of both NASA’s Artemis campaign and SpaceX’s plan to start deploying higher-capacity Starlink satellites.\nActing NASA Administrator Sean Duffy applauded the mission on X, saying it was “another major step toward landing Americans on the Moon’s south pole.”\nSpaceX was awarded more than $4 billion to develop a human-rated variant of Starship, called the Human Landing System, for the Artemis 3 crewed mission currently scheduled for 2027. But meeting that date will require SpaceX to demonstrate increasingly complex milestones first, especially orbital docking and in-orbit propellant transfer.\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you’re emailing to set up a meeting.\nThe company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings.\nThe launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users’ everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google’s latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more.\nTo use the meeting scheduling option, you’ll click the new “Help me schedule” button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people’s calendars. \nWhile there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini’s AI to use the email’s context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they’d like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nCoco Robotics, a startup known for its fleet of last-mile delivery bots, is looking to get more information out of the five years’ worth of data its robots have collected. Its answer: a physical AI lab with University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) professor Bolei Zhou at the helm.\nCoco Robotics, which made the announcement Tuesday, said Zhou has also joined the Los Angeles-based startup as chief AI scientist.\nWhen the company launched in 2020, it used teleoperators to help the bots navigate obstacles on their delivery routes. Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash told TechCrunch the company’s goal has always been to operate its last-mile delivery robots autonomously to cut the overall costs of delivery. Now, Rash said the company has collected enough data to dive deeper into automation.\n“We have millions of miles of data collected in the most complicated urban settings possible, and that data is incredibly important for training any sort of useful and reliable real world AI systems,” Rash said. “We’re now at the point where we have sufficient data scale where I think we can start really accelerating a lot of the research happening around physical AI.”\nThe decision to tap Zhou to lead the effort was a “no brainer,” Rash said. Zhou’s research around computer vision and robotics has largely focused on micromobility, as opposed to full-scale vehicles, Rash said.\nCoco Robotics was already collaborating with Zhou, too. Both Rash and his co-founder Brad Squicciarini are UCLA alums and have even donated one of their bots to the school’s research lab.\n“[Zhou] is one of the leading researchers in the whole world on robot navigation, reinforcement learning, and a lot of the technologies and areas of research that are highly relevant for us,” Rash said. “He’s been already very capable of recruiting some of the top researchers in the world who he’s worked with in the past to come join Coco and help accelerate things on our end.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis new research lab is separate from the collaboration the robotics startup has with OpenAI, which allows Coco Robotics to use OpenAI’s models while the AI research lab gets access to the company’s robot-collected data.\nCoco Robotics plans to use the information and research it gathers from the lab for its own purposes for now. Rash said the company doesn’t have plans to sell the data to its peers.\nRather, it will be used for the company to improve its automation and efficiency, which will mainly pertain to the local models its robots run on. Rash said they also plan to share their research findings with the cities they operate in when applicable, to help fix obstacles and infrastructure that slows their bots down.\n“Success for this lab really looks at us offering a higher-quality service at an extremely low price,” Rash said. “How do we get our costs lower? How do we make this much more affordable for businesses and customers? I think that’s going to create a tremendous amount of growth in this ecosystem.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

According to YouTube, these videos come from reputable sources and are tailored to the developmental stage of teenagers. The company collaborated with organizations that specialize in mental health and well-being information for young people, such as the Child Mind Institute.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nThis launch signifies a move toward making YouTube a trustworthy resource for younger users facing mental health challenges. A 2023 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 39.7% of students felt ongoing sadness and hopelessness, while 28.5% reported poor mental health.\nAdditionally, this is a notable addition for the platform as it’s important to reach teens where they already seek information, such as YouTube, with nine out of ten teens reporting they use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the years, YouTube has invested in various initiatives to assist teenagers. These include implementing specific safeguards when recommending certain topics to teens, using age-estimation technology to recognize teenage users for a more suitable experience, and providing parental controls that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens’ accounts.\nThe new mental health and wellbeing offering is rolling out to users in the U.S., the UK, Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia in the coming weeks. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nWalmart announced on Tuesday a new partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to shop Walmart’s products via the AI chatbot, including things like groceries (not fresh food), household essentials, and more, and then instantly check out.\nThe agentic shopping feature will also allow Sam’s Club members to plan meals and restock essentials while also discovering new items when chatting with the AI, the company says.\nTo use the feature, customers will press a “buy” button in ChatGPT’s app when they shop, after linking their Walmart accounts to ChatGPT. Products from third-party sellers will also be supported when the feature rolls out later this fall. \nWalmart explains that the new agreement with OpenAI will allow the retailer to better learn and predict customers’ needs, making online shopping more personalized and proactive, instead of only reactive. \nThe partnership follows OpenAI’s recent announcement of its plan to enter the world of e-commerce with an agentic shopping system, which includes product discovery, recommendation, and payments. Initially, OpenAI is teaming up with Etsy and Shopify sellers, the company said. \nThe ChatGPT-focused shopping feature won’t be the only way consumers can shop with AI. Alongside other AI investments, Walmart recently introduced its own generative AI shopping assistant, Sparky, designed to help customers discover and compare products and make purchases. The feature will expand to include reordering, service booking, and understanding multimodal inputs from text, images, audio, and video.\nThe retailer has an existing relationship with OpenAI in other areas of its business, as well, having adopted OpenAI Certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise for its internal teams. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club broadly use AI to do other things, like speeding up fashion production by up to 18 weeks and improving customer care timeframes by up to 40%.\n“For many years now, e-commerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change,” noted Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon in a prepared statement. “There is a native AI experience coming that is multimedia, personalized, and contextual. We are running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future with Sparky and through partnerships, including this important step with OpenAI,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Managed Accounts are now rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands following a pilot launch last year.\nManaged Accounts are available to Spotify Premium Family plan members and allow account holders to manage a separate music-only listening experience for their kids under the age of 13.\nSince these accounts are separate, your kids’ music choices won’t impact your algorithm or show up in your annual Spotify Wrapped experience. Kids can add songs to their favorites, create their own playlists, and have their own personalized recommendations.\nWith Managed Accounts, parents can restrict access to certain features, such as watching videos, playing content, or viewing Canvas videos, which are the looping visuals that appear during music playback, for any content labeled as explicit. Parents can also control and restrict the playback of specific artists and songs.\nInteractivity features are also limited on managed accounts, which means that kids won’t get access to age-gated features like Messages.\nManaged Accounts allow parents to make more granular decisions about the kind of music their child can listen to, without forcing them to use the more restrictive Spotify Kids app.\nTo set up the managed account, Family Plan account holders need to navigate to their account pages in the app, select the “Add a Member” option, and then select the option to “Add a listener aged under 13 (or the market equivalent),” then follow the instructions to navigate the various options.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSpotify’s Managed Accounts are already available in New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia.\nThe wider launch comes amid broader efforts by major tech companies to provide parents with greater control over how their children use online platforms and what features are accessible to them in response to regulatory pressure.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWater quality is the most important thing for aquaculture farms to monitor to ensure their livestock remain healthy. While there are existing ways to monitor water quality —  sensors and water testing kits — they are too expensive for many farmers in regions like Southeast Asia.\nAquawise wants to offer aquaculture farmers in Southeast Asia a better way to monitor their water quality by using AI and existing satellites — no hardware purchases required.\nBangkok-based Aquawise takes satellite images of fish and shrimp farms and feeds them into its physics-based AI model that monitors the water for things like temperature, level of chlorophyl, and oxygen levels.\nAquawise’s platform can monitor water quality continuously; traditional methods monitor daily or weekly. Aquawise also offers tracking and predictions.\n“Water quality is one of the most important things in aquaculture,” Patipond Tiyapunjanit, co-founder and CEO of Aquawise, told TechCrunch. “It’s like being a human: You have to breathe. The aquatic life, they are living in the water all the time. If the water quality does not stay at the optimal level, it could cause the stress, it could cause disease outbreak, and a lot of things.”\nAquawise will be showcasing its tech as part of this year’s Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, which runs October 27 to 29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West.\nNineteen-year-old Tiyapunjanit said that the idea for the company started with a love of shrimp that led to a research project about shrimp larvae.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile presenting his project at the 2023 Young Scientist Competition, he met his co-founders, Chanati Jantrachotechatchawan and Kobchai Duangrattanalert, who were advising a rival team. Jantrachotechatchawan and Duangrattanalert were impressed by Tiyapunjanit and ended up advising Tiyapunjanit’s project, which went on to win the 2024 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.\nThen the trio had to figure out what to do next.\n“We have to step back and try to find the most important problem in this industry,” Tiyapunjanit said. “We found that it is a water quality problem; 80% of farms in aquaculture today are facing it. It cost almost $30 billion of losses each year.”\nThat became the foundation for Aquawise which was founded in 2024.\nWater quality isn’t as big of an issue for aquaculture farms in regions like the United States and Europe, but is a much bigger problem in developing regions like Southeast Asia, Duangrattanalert told TechCrunch. Farmers in this region can’t afford monitoring technology and instead rely on weather reports and manual checks on the water, despite the potential consequences of poor water quality.\nAquawise’s first idea was to use sonar to monitor water quality, Duangrattanalert said. Their original idea was to use acoustic sonar to capture data from water — and even tested it on a tank of fish at Tiyapunjanit’s house — before realizing that it would still be too big of a financial hurdle for farmers.\n“We want people, especially in Thailand, and in the whole Southeast Asia [region], to feel that they can use it in order to improve their livelihood in term of the community, the region and the farm itself,” Duangrattanalert said.\nAquawise works with multiple farms and is using the data it collects to continue to train its AI model. The company wants to make sure its model is accurate before it starts selling to farms.\nThe startup also plans to raise money from investors in the new year as well.\n“Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector worldwide today,” Tiyapunjanit said. “It was the one industry projected by United Nation as the best way to help feed 10 billion people in coming years because of its ability to create high nutrition with very low amount of emission.”\nIf you want to learn from Aquawise firsthand and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nFinnish health tech company Oura has raised $900 million in fresh funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation from new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.\nThe company said today that this funding will value it at “approximately $11 billion,” more than double the valuation it received for its last round in December. Bloomberg previously reported that Oura was closing new funding at $11 billion valuation.\n“This new funding is a testament to the strength of Oura business and the trust millions of members place in us every day. We’re proud to be building not just a product, but a global movement toward proactive health—helping people understand their bodies, make better lifestyle decisions, and connect more effectively with their healthcare providers,” CEO Tom Hale said in a statement. \nThe company told TechCrunch that it plans to use the new funding for AI and production innovation, introducing new health features, and improving its global distribution.\nOura has sold over 5.5 million smart rings since launch. The past year has been particularly fruitful for the company, providing more than half of those sales. The smart ring maker more than doubled its revenue in 2024, raking in $500 million. The company expects the trend to continue this year, with sales likely to cross $1 billion. According to a report from IDC published last year, Oura holds more than 80% of the smart ring market.\nThe company is also luring in customers of different demographics. Earlier this week, at the Elevate conference in Toronto, Oura’s chief commercial officer, Dorothy Kilroy, said that women in their early twenties are becoming a core market for the company. \nOura launched its latest device, Oura ring 4, last October.

    "body": "\nAirbound, an Indian drone startup, has raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom, as it begins a drone-delivery pilot with a private hospital and works toward one-cent delivery using its ultra-light, blended-wing-body aircraft.\nThe seed round includes participation from Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril.\nFounded in 2020 by Naman Pushp — who was 15 at the time and is now 20 — Airbound has developed an aircraft using a tail-sitter design (where the drone sits vertically and launches upright like a rocket) and carbon fiber frame, aiming to deliver parcels at up to 20 times lower cost than conventional methods and significantly cheaper than existing drone delivery systems. The aircraft uses a blended-wing-body shape with two propellers, rather than the more common quadcopter configuration. This enables the aircraft to take off like a rocket and fly like a plane.\nAirbound is targeting one-cent deliveries by rethinking how energy is used to move goods, founder and CEO Pushp said in an interview.\nTypically, electric two-wheelers are used in India to deliver payloads weighing under 3 kilograms, Pushp told TechCrunch, even though the vehicles themselves weigh around 150 kilograms (331 pounds) and cost about ₹2 (about $0.02) per kilometer in energy. Airbound aims to cut that cost down to as low as 10 paise (around $0.001) by using its drone, called the TRT, which is built specifically for small payloads and removes the need for a human driver — reducing total transport weight by roughly 30 times. That, Pushp said, translates into a 20-fold drop in energy cost per kilometer, making one-cent drone delivery a feasible end state.\n“There is actually an incredible amount of gaps between where drones are today and where they can be,” the founder said. “You need four kilograms of drone to lift one kilogram of payload, which is insane to me. Range is a broken metric. There’s no concept of aerodynamic efficiency with drones “[right now].”\nThe aircraft’s rocket-like, blended-wing design eliminates the need for additional propellers and heavy moving parts, improving aerodynamic efficiency over conventional quadcopters. By avoiding propellers that disrupt airflow over the wing, the drone maintains a higher lift-to-drag ratio, reducing the amount of thrust needed to stay aloft and making forward flight significantly more energy-efficient, the founder told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe first version of Airbound’s drone weighs 3.3 pounds and carries a payload of up to 2.2 pounds, and the startup also aims for its second version to support a 6.6-pound payload while weighing just 2.6 pounds itself.\nA prototype of the second version is expected to be ready and flying by mid-next year, with production targeted for the first quarter of 2027, Pushp said.\n“When you get into the world of autonomy, logistics is just a physics problem. It’s a game of efficiency and weight. And so if you have a lower weight than anyone else and a higher efficiency than others, you win,” Pushp said.\nHe began working on Airbound during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, inspired by a video of Zipline, the on-demand drone delivery company. He submitted an early prototype — made from 2D slices held together with toothpicks and tape, then sanded to resemble a fiberglass body — to a hackathon, where it earned a $500 grant. That experience prompted him to apply to Y Combinator, though he was not accepted. Instead, he received a $1,000 grant from the 1517 Fund in 2021, followed by a $25,000 check from Grad Capital and a $12,000 grant from Emergent Ventures.\nAt 17, Pushp received a term sheet from Lightspeed, but waited until after his 18th birthday to sign it. “That was the first legally binding document that I signed,” he recalled.\nThe aircraft packs lithium-ion batteries — instead of a commonly used lithium-polymer battery pack. Lithium ion batteries typically have a cycle life of 500 to 800 cycles, whereas lithium polymer lasts for around 100–200 cycles, Pushp said.\n“The biggest cost of operating these drones ends up being their battery replacement costs,” he said.\nThe drone costs Airbound $2,000 to make and ₹24 (around $0.27) per delivery. The startup aims to cut the delivery cost to below ₹5 (roughly $0.05) by the end of 2026. It also projects reaching a million deliveries per day by the middle of 2027, and to achieve that, it plans to increase its manufacturing capacity to over 100 drones a day. This is up from the startup’s current one-drone-per-day production rate at its Bengaluru facility.\nAirbound has started its first pilot program with Bengaluru’s Narayana Health through which it will deliver medical logistics for three months, aiming to complete ten deliveries a day of medical tests, blood samples, and other critical supplies.\nHowever, Airbound also targets other sectors including quick commerce, food deliveries, and “a few other smaller areas of last-mile” delivery, the founder told TechCrunch.\nAirbound also plans to go beyond India after scaling to one million deliveries per day and enter the U.S. in three years. Meanwhile, the startup is also in talks with regulators including India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation to start its flights soon.\nTo date, Airbound has raised over $10 million in total funding, and it has a team of 50 people.\nThe latest round will help scale its manufacturing capabilities and expand operations. The pilot program will also help improve its service and reduce costs to better prepare for broader market adoption in 2026, the startup said.\n"

    "body": "\nHelp desk automation is a billion-dollar industry, and one of the most likely to be disrupted by tech built upon AI. Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in.\nRisotto is one of those startups, and after today, it will have plenty of runway to test its theory. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and Surgepoint Capital.\nDesigned to autonomously resolve help desk tickets, Risotto sits between ticket management systems like Jira and the complex internal tooling needed to resolve them. The product is built on a third-party foundation model, but CEO Aron Solberg says the core of the business is the infrastructure that sits between the model and the customer, keeping the non-deterministic nature of the model in check.\n“Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it’s expected to do,” Solberg told TechCrunch.\nWorking with the payroll company Gusto, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.\n“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.”\nIn practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It’s a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces.\nIn the meantime, Risotto’s most immediate value proposition comes from taming the mess of different IT systems. As Solberg sees it, there is still plenty of value in making it easier to use existing ticketing systems.\n“One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says. “And that’s to say nothing about implementing AI. That’s just to wrangle the platform itself.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The company is instead focusing on offering that technology to third parties, like concession stands at sports stadiums.\n“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” the company wrote in a blog post.\nThese retail closures will not impact customers who use Amazon for grocery delivery. \nIt’s not surprising that Amazon will divest from its branded retail stores, given that Amazon has been cutting down on its physical retail presence over the last few years. Upon closing down some stores in 2024, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “couldn’t make the economics work with the lease cost.”  \nAmazon isn’t giving up on the brick-and-mortar side of its business, though. Instead, it will embrace the fact that people have a stronger brand affinity with Whole Foods Market than the Amazon Go convenience store. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon will open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next few years. The company says Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth and expansion to 550 stores since it was acquired by Amazon in 2017.\nAmazon also plans to open more Whole Foods Market Daily Shop locations — a smaller version of the grocery store with an emphasis on convenience and grab-and-go meals.

    "body": "\nChina’s Moonshot AI, which is backed by the likes of Alibaba and HongShan (formerly Sequioa China), today released a new open-source model, Kimi K2.5, which understands text, image, and video.\nThe company said that the model was trained on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens, and that’s why it is natively multimodal. It added that the models are good at coding tasks and handling agent swarms —  an orchestration where multiple agents work together. In released benchmarks, the model matches the performance of the proprietary peers and even beats them in certain tasks.\nFor instance, in the coding benchmark, the Kimi K2.5 outperforms Gemini 3 Pro at the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, and scores higher than GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on the SWE-Bench Multilingual benchmark. In video understanding, it beats GPT 5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 on VideoMMMU (Video Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding), a benchmark that measures how a model reasons over videos.\nImage Credits: Moonshot AI\nMoonshot AI said that on the coding front, while the model can understand text well, users can also feed it images or videos and ask it to make a similar interface shown in those media files. \n\nHere's a short video from our founder, Zhilin Yang.(It's his first time speaking on camera like this, and he really wanted to share Kimi K2.5 with you!) pic.twitter.com/2uDSOjCjly— Kimi.ai (@Kimi_Moonshot) January 27, 2026\n\nTo let people use these coding capabilities, the company has launched an open-source coding tool called Kimi Code, which would rival Anthropic’s Claude Code or Google’s Gemini CLI. Developers can use Kimi Code through their terminals or integrate it with development software such as VSCode, Cursor, and Zed. The startup said that developers can use images and videos as input with Kimi Code.\nCoding tools have gained rapid popularity and are becoming revenue drivers for AI labs. Anthropic announced in November that Claude Code had reached $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). Earlier this month, Wired reported that by the end of 2025, the tool had added $100 million to that figure. Moonshot’s Chinese competitor, Deepseek, is set to release a new model with strong coding chops next month, according to a report by The Information. \nMoonshot was founded by former Google and Meta AI researcher Yang Zhilin. The company raised $1 billion in funding in a Series B round at a $2.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, the startup picked up $500 million in funding last month at $4.3 billion valuation. What’s more, the report noted that it is already seeking to raise a new round at a $5 billion valuation.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLuminar received an even higher bid for its lidar business as a court-run auction concluded on Monday, according to a new filing in the company’s bankruptcy case.\nMicroVision, a Redmond, Washington-based company that has been developing its own lidar sensors, submitted a $33 million bid, eclipsing the $22 million that Quantum Computing Inc. laid out a few weeks ago as the so-called “stalking horse” bidder. (Quantum Computing Inc. had upped its bid to $28 million but apparently was unwilling or unable to go higher.) \nIn a statement, MicroVision said Tuesday that it is acquiring “IP and inventory related to the Iris and Halo lidar sensors, key engineering and operations talent, and certain commercial contracts and orders.”\n“It’s no secret that the lidar market has been ripe for disruption and in need of further consolidation,” MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said. “Building on our proven executive leadership in automotive, our history of developing and delivering products in defense, and now an even more expansive portfolio of technologically diverse lidar sensors and advanced perception solutions, we believe MicroVision is ready to upend the industry, enabling widespread commercial adoption and significantly increased safety.”\nThe sale of Luminar’s lidar business will now be subject to approval by the judge in the bankruptcy case. A hearing is slated for Tuesday afternoon. \nIt’s not clear if Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell submitted a bid for his company’s lidar assets. Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy the company outright in October 2025 before it filed for bankruptcy, and he expressed an interest on making a bid during the bankruptcy process. Representatives for Russell did not respond to a request for comment.\nThat said, Russell and Luminar spent the first month of the bankruptcy case fighting over a subpoena. The company has said it is still evaluating whether to take legal action against Russell, tied to his resignation last May, which followed a board-run ethics inquiry. While Russell already turned over his computers to Luminar, he had been holding onto his phone until he received a guarantee from the company that any personal information on the device would be protected. Luminar accused him of dodging the subpoena.\nRussell ultimately agreed to accept the subpoena last week. Over the weekend, he and Luminar made a joint filing in court laying out the terms of a protective order regarding his personal information.\nIf the sale of the lidar assets goes through, it could bring about a fairly swift end to Luminar’s bankruptcy case, which was filed in December. The company has already reached an agreement to sell its other business division, centered around semiconductors, to Quantum Computing Inc. for $110 million. \nThis story has been updated with a statement from MicroVision.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nPeople around the world now spend hours a day on their smartphones. On average, daily smartphone use exceeds three hours, and for many adults, total screen time climbs to six hours or more, according to research. This constant close-up screen exposure has been linked to a growing list of eye-health issues, including dry and irritated eyes, eye fatigue, blurred vision, headaches, and the worsening of nearsightedness, per reports.\nEdenlux, a South Korea–headquartered startup, has developed technology to address eye and ear health issues caused by screen-heavy digital lifestyles.\nThe company’s mission is personal. Edenlux founder and CEO Sungyong Park knows first-hand what it feels like to lose control of your eyesight. While serving as a military physician, Park received a muscle relaxant injection for severe neck stiffness. It triggered a rare side effect: temporary paralysis of the eye muscles responsible for focusing. Doctors told him there was little to do but wait.\nPark didn’t wait. He imported specialized ophthalmic equipment and began retraining his eye muscles himself. Over time, his vision gradually returned. That experience reshaped his understanding of eye health, leading Park, a medical doctor turned entrepreneur, to develop technology to help people protect and restore their vision in a screen-heavy world.\nNow, Edenlux is preparing to launch its second wellness device, Eyeary, a daily visual recovery tool aimed at the U.S. market, with a planned Indiegogo launch around the end of March. Unlike medical devices, Edenlux’s products fall under the FDA’s wellness category, allowing them to be described for vision training and general eye health. (The company opted to launch on Indiegogo rather than seek investor funding, Park said, citing sufficient cash reserves to support operations for several years.)\nThe company’s first product, Otus, launched in 2022 in South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan. The bulky, VR-style device uses lenses to contract and relax the ciliary muscle. Otus has generated $10 million in cumulative revenue, and Edenlux says Eyeary is designed to be faster and easier to use.\n“With Otus, users typically took about 12 months to reduce their dependence on reading glasses. Eyeary could shorten that to around six months,” Park claimed.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nimage credits: edenluxImage Credits:Edenlux\nEyeary is also a design leap, he added. It looks like normal glasses, is lighter and more comfortable and the lens system includes 144 diopter focal points, allowing for finer focus adjustments and more precise eye-muscle training. (Otus has five diopter focal points) The device pairs with a mobile app via Bluetooth, collecting usage data and feeding it to Edenlux’s servers. The company analyzes datasets across age, gender, and vision profiles, using AI to predict improvement timelines and customize training programs.\nProlonged screen time can overwork the ciliary muscle, which controls the lens inside the eye. “When people are young, the muscle is strong enough to focus,” Park said. “But constant smartphone use keeps it contracted, and over time, it can weaken, leading to fatigue and vision problems.”\nEdenlux has developed a suite of products targeting specific eye conditions, including Otus and Eyeary for visual recovery, Tearmore for dry eye, Lux-S for strabismus, Lumia for myopia prevention, and Heary for auditory recovery. Tearmore, Lux-S, Lumia, and Heary are expected to roll out in Asia, Park said.\nPark sees companies like Oura Ring as peers. Both collect human data and provide insights via software, on a subscription model. But while Oura focuses on heart rate and sleep, Edenlux targets vision and hearing health.\nIts target customers include all individuals who regularly use smartphones and earphones. “We aim to address the root causes of eye and hearing problems from digital device overuse,” Park said.\nEdenlux raised $39 million in its Series A round in 2020 and $60 million in Series B funding in 2022. The company recently established a U.S. subsidiary in Dallas, Texas, where its devices will undergo final assembly.\nWhile Edenlux currently develops and manufactures in-house, it’s exploring partnerships with major tech firms like Apple or Samsung, aiming to integrate its vision-protecting technology with smartphones.\nCombining firsthand insight, advanced science, and hardware devices, Edenlux believes that eye health in the digital age is more than a wellness trend – it’s an emerging area in consumer technology.\n"

    "body": "\nFlora, a design tool used by designers at Alibaba, Brex, creative agency Pentagram, and entertainment company Lionsgate, has hit a new milestone. The startup has raised $42 million in Series A led by Redpoint Ventures, it announced on Tuesday.\nGenerative AI models can be used in the design process via prompts and other multimodal inputs. Software companies like Adobe, Figma, and Canva have also added features to make AI more central to their products. Meanwhile, newer design startups believe that to accommodate AI and test the capabilities of different models, you need new workflows and a different interface.\nTo address these evolving needs, Flora lets customers use image, text, or video to create media assets, including images and video. Users can also use prompts to create modifications to build new nodes with multiple iterations. These generated versions are mapped with each other on a canvas to give you a tractable flow of creation. \nUsers can then branch out from any node to create a new version of the concept or creative they are trying to make. For instance, if someone wants to create a marketing video, they can provide reference images and text prompts to create a concept. They can then add different prompts to make different videos in contrasting styles to see which one is better. \nFlora’s CEO and founder, Weber Wong, was previously an investor at Menlo Ventures. After that, he joined New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, which fuses tech and art. Flora’s alpha version was launched in 2024 as part of the course.\nThe company launched a more stable version of the tool last year.\nFlora CEO Weber Wong Image Credits: Flora\nWong said that he realized that there was an opportunity to create a new interface to stitch different models together and create an entire workflow in one screen.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Our realization [while building Flora] was that the generative computing paradigm needed a new creative interface. If you think about the personal computing paradigm, that’s what Adobe was for: controlling every single pixel on the screen to make one piece of media at a time. You now have these models that can make entire pieces of midea like that. So the natural creative opportunity is to take a step back and design the entire creative workflow,” he said.\nWong said that typically, node-based creation has been complex, but with AI in the mix, it allows designers to go through multiple iterations and ideas quickly. With Flora, you can use text, image, or video to create media or concepts.\nThe rise in generative models has made AI-first startups a hot commodity. In October, OpenAI acquired Sequioa-backed Visual Electric, and Figma acquired node-based editor Weavy. Separately, Krea, which also has a node-based editor, raised $83 million in April. \nWong noted that launches of tools like this bring an overlap of professionals and people using AI, resulting in more people using apps like Flora for design and ideation. Despite its demand, Wong thinks that for these tools to become more popular, there needs to be improved user education. For this, the company deploys creatives to work with other organizations and help them use Flora better.\nWhile the startup’s slant is more towards creatives, the tool is easy enough to be used by business owners or individual users. Flora’s plans start from $16 per month (paid annually), and then scale up for agencies and enterprises.\nFlora plans to use its newly acquired funding money to scale its enterprise sales capabilities. Plus, it wants to put more effort into marketing its product. On the product side, it wants to build better creative controls and also add some traditional editing capabilities so professionals don’t need to go to another tool to finish their project. The startup currently has 25 people, and it will possibly double or triple that headcount by the end of the year.\nRedpoint Venture’s Alex Bard told TechCrunch that the venture firm’s team was impressed by the elegant design of the product and how easy it was for anyone to get started.\n“Where we got excited about Flora is that the team is doing the same work as Figma of democratizing product design and bringing more people into the design process because of how they built the product to make it approachable and collaborative,” Bard said.\nHe added that from a market opportunity perspective, Flora can impact a broader creative process in industries like fashion, advertising, photography, and branding. \nThe Series A also saw participation from Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, Twitch founder Justin Kan, Frame.io CEO Emery Wells, Hanabi Capital’s GP Mike Volpi, Menlo Ventures, a16z Games, Fal co-founders Gorkem Yurtseven, Burkay Gur, and Batuhan Taskaya, Long Journey Ventures, Cyan Banister, Factorial Capital’s managing partner Matt Hartman, and MSCHF founder Gabe Whaley. With this raise, the company’s total funding to date has reached $52 million.\n"

    "body": "\nThe 2026 Game Developers Conference is shaping up to be a little less international this year if commentary on social media platforms like LinkedIn is an indicator. \nMany members of the international games industry have announced they will skip the event, mainly over concerns about safety, tougher U.S. immigration rules, and a stronger immigration and Customs Enforcement presence. Developers, past GDC attendees, and other industry professionals have taken to platforms like LinkedIn to publicly voice their concerns.\nICE activity in numerous U.S. cities as well as the recent fatal shootings in Minneapolis involving ICE agents have compounded concerns. Renee Nicole Good was killed on January 7, and ICU nurse Alex Pretti lost his life on January 24. Many travelers also said they’re worried about unpredictable border checks and safety concerns.\nAs one person put it, “It’s not worth taking the risk of going.” Another chimed in: “The U.S. is just a very problematic location for an international event.”\nGDC, now rebranded as the “GDC Festival of Gaming,” is scheduled to take place in San Francisco from March 9 to 13.\nOthers cited general concerns over safety as well as cost as factors in their decision not to attend. Some indie developers and small studios have said the costs, which include hotel, food, travel, and the ticket price, are just too high.\nIn response to these concerns, GDC president Nina Brown told Mobilegamer.biz, that the “safety of our community is always our top priority.” In a statement, Brown said the GDC works closely with “local officials and legal experts to monitor U.S. policy changes” and to provide the most up-to-date guidance. Brown also advised international attendees to start their visa applications early and consult with their embassies regarding any special requirements.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​Brown also outlined several safety measures, including that GDC offers a 24/7 safety hotline, safety training for event staff, and security escorts upon request. San Francisco’s Safety Community Ambassadors program will also be present, providing additional support to attendees throughout the event.\nTechCrunch has also reached out to GDC for comment and will update this article if the organization responds. \nOn the cost front, GDC has introduced a simpler, more affordable ticketing system to make the event more accessible to smaller developers and indie studios. The new Festival Pass replaces the previous All-Access pass and is 45% cheaper, with pricing starting at $649 and providing access to all main event programming.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nTo understand the stance of an unwavering Trump loyalist after a federal border patrol agent shocked the nation this weekend by shooting an American citizen in Minneapolis, look no further than Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois.\nRabois’ public support for Border Patrol’s actions in the killing of Alex Pretti, made via posts on X, was so vehement that Khosla Ventures partner Ethan Choi and firm founder Vinod Khosla both publicly disavowed it.\nRabois argued that Pretti was at fault, writing that the protester was committing a “felony.” One of Rabois’ posts said, “no law enforcement has shot an innocent person. illegals are committing violent crimes every day.” Another said: “he unequivocally attempted to draw his weapon. fuck you.” In another post that discussed citizens’ ability to exercise their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights, the VC weighed in: “yes but interfering w a law enforcement operation is not protected by any of those amendments.”\nAmong other comments, Rabois went on to say he doesn’t believe that the Minneapolis police could be credible sources in an investigation: “i don’t think you should ask any law enforcement in MN. But i am very open to reading views from any other urban jurisdiction.” He instead blamed the city’s police for the situation: “Because the MN police’s refusal to cooperate is exactly what is leading to these treacherous conditions (for everyone).”\nAnd so on.\nX reacted as you might expect. Other Trump supporters cheered Rabois on, while those who condemn ICE’s actions argued with and condemned the investor.\nThe situation spiraled so much that when one person suggested that founders remove Khosla Ventures from their cap tables altogether, Khosla partner Choi piped up to distance himself.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChoi posted: “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at @khoslaventures, at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”\nThen the founder of the firm, Khosla himself, stood by Choi. “I agree with @EthanChoi7. Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck [sic] empowered by a conscious-less administration,” he said in his post on X.\n\nI agree with @EthanChoi7 . Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration. The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society. ICE… https://t.co/ASvjZQB0Gg— Vinod Khosla (@vkhosla) January 26, 2026\n\nUnder normal circumstances, opposing political points of view can be a strength for a VC firm. Whatever anyone thinks of Rabois’ politics, he’s been a very successful investor backing such companies as DoorDash, Affirm, Faire, and Stripe, as well as co-founding Opendoor, among other startups.\nBut sometimes they are internally disruptive. \nSequoia was embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire (whose comments over the weekend on ICE align with Rabois’) remains as an investor at Sequoia. But its leader at the time of the Mamdani controversy, Roelof Botha, stepped down as senior steward in November. Botha was replaced by Alfred Lin and Pat Grady (neither of whom weighed in over the weekend).\nIn this case, the rift between Khosla partners spilled out publicly. But note that Khosla did not directly chastise Rabois. (The company did not respond to our request for comment.)\nWhen Khosla Ventures rehired Rabois in 2024, the firm knew it was bringing in an outspoken, self-proclaimed “contrarian” into its ranks, of the ilk that liked to blame the “woke” and praise President Trump. For Rabois’ part, he knew he would be working for a vocal Trump critic (Vinod Khosla has made his point of view on Trump very clear for years).\nWill there be continued fallout? Perhaps — but only if founders really do start dumping Khosla Ventures from their cap tables.\n"

    "body": "\nMeta plans to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on its apps, the company told TechCrunch on Monday. The tech giant said the new subscriptions will unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\nIn the coming months, Meta said it will offer a premium experience on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp that gives users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. Meta doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, noting that it will test a variety of subscription features and bundles, and that each app subscription will have a distinct set of exclusive features. \nMeta also shared that it plans to scale Manus, an AI agent it recently acquired for a reported $2 billion, as part of its subscription plans. \nMeta is taking a two-fold approach to Manus. The company is going to integrate Manus into Meta products, while continuing to sell standalone subscriptions to businesses. Meta has already been spotted working on adding a shortcut to Manus AI on Instagram, according to a screenshot shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development.\nAdditionally, Meta plans to test subscriptions for AI features, such as Vibes video generation. Vibes is Meta’s AI-powered short-form video experience built into the Meta AI app that lets people create and remix AI-generated videos. Although Vibes has been free since its launch last year, Meta now plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. \nWhile it’s unknown what the paid features on WhatsApp and Facebook will look like, Paluzzi notes that the new subscription on Instagram will let users create unlimited audience lists, the ability to see a list of followers who don’t follow you back, and the option to view a Story without the poster seeing that you viewed it. \nIt’s worth noting that the new subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified. The tech giant says it’s going to use what it learned from Meta Verified to evolve its subscription business to include more offerings it thinks everyday users, creators, and businesses will want.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta Verified is aimed at content creators and businesses, as it comes with a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, impersonation protections, search optimization, exclusive stickers, and more. While these features aren’t aimed at everyday users or non-creators, the new subscriptions will be designed for a broader audience.\nThe launch of additional subscriptions will allow Meta to generate more revenue; however, many users may be deterred by subscription fatigue. With so many paid services competing for monthly spending, Meta will have to offer a compelling product to get users to sign up for yet another subscription.\nSnap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, as its Snapchat+ offering continues to be a revenue driver. Snapchat+, which starts at $3.99 per month for exclusive features, has topped 16 million subscribers, more than doubling since early 2024.\nMeta says it plans to listen to its community of users and gather feedback as it starts rolling out the subscriptions in the coming months.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA group of YouTubers who are suing tech giants for scraping their videos without permission to train AI models has now added Snap to their list of defendants. The plaintiffs — internet content creators behind a trio of YouTube channels with roughly 6.2 million collective subscribers — allege that Snap has trained its AI systems on their video content for use in AI features like the app’s “Imagine Lens,” which allows users to edit images using text prompts.\nThe plaintiffs earlier filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance over similar matters.\nIn the newly filed proposed class action suit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the YouTubers specifically call out Snap for its use of a large-scale, video-language dataset known as HD-VILA-100M, and others that were designed for only academic and research purposes. To use these datasets for commercial purposes, the plaintiffs claim Snap circumvented YouTube’s technological restrictions, terms of service, and licensing limitations, which prohibit commercial use.\nThe suit is seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged copyright infringement going forward.\nThe case itself is being led by the creators behind the h3h3 YouTube channel, with 5.52 million subscribers, and the smaller golfing channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfholics.\nIt’s now one of many lawsuits pitting content creators against AI model providers, which have included copyright disputes from publishers, authors, newspapers, user-generated content sites, artists, and more. It’s also not the first case to hail from a YouTuber. According to the nonprofit organization Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies.\nIn some cases, like one between Meta and a group of authors, a judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant. In others, like the case between Anthropic and a group of authors, the AI giant has settled with and paid out the plaintiffs to resolve their claims. Many cases are still in active litigation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSnap was asked for comment.

    "description": "SuperAgent is Airtable's first standalone product in its 13-year history, and signals both the company's ambitions and the reality of the current AI moment: every serious software player is racing to prove they can deliver on agents.",
    "body": "\nIt might sound crazy to some, launching an entirely new product line while your flagship business has shed two-thirds of its paper value. But Howie Liu, the founder and CEO of Airtable, suggests it’s the sanest thing he could do.\nThe company that investors valued at $11.7 billion during the zero-interest-rate fervor of 2021 now trades on secondary markets at roughly $4 billion. But Airtable has raised $1.4 billion total, and Liu says the company still has half of that in the bank while “throwing off cash.” The valuation collapse affected investor returns and employee stock options, but didn’t undermine the business itself.\nLiu’s response is to launch Superagent, an AI agent he suggests could eventually eclipse Airtable itself. It’s Airtable’s first standalone product in its 13-year history, and captures both where the company is headed and the reality of the current AI moment: every serious software player is racing to prove they can deliver on agents.\nTo understand what makes this move especially interesting, consider what Airtable is: a no-code platform that democratizes app-building. It’s essentially a supercharged database that lets anyone create custom software tailored to their workflows. The company now employs more than 700 people and serves over 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100. This isn’t a struggling startup but instead a mature business betting its future on a new architecture.\nSuperagent represents Liu’s bet on “multi-agent coordination”—a system where you ask a question and get not one AI assistant fumbling through sequential tasks, but a coordinating agent that deploys specialists working in parallel. “You’re not prompting an AI,” Liu explains. “You’re orchestrating a team.”\nHere’s how it works: When you ask Superagent about expanding your athleisure brand into Europe (an example from Liu), the system first builds a research plan, identifying what needs investigation and surfacing dimensions you didn’t think to ask about. Then it deploys specialized agents in parallel – one investigating financials, another analyzing competitive positioning, another reviewing management and news. Finally, it synthesizes everything into a finished deliverable.\nThe output isn’t a wall of text. It’s an interactive market analysis with demographic breakdowns, competitive presence mapped visually, and expansion timelines you can filter and explore. “What if every person could have New York Times-quality data visualization built for every task they have,” Liu told me over Zoom last week. “This would have been unfathomable ten years ago, or five years ago, where you don’t get that quality of output – you just get text. But to be able to now get truly extremely high quality, rich interactive outputs as a default format, I think that’s a game changer.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe distinction Liu draws between Superagent and competitors is technical. He name-checks Anthropic’s AI agent Claude and Manus (a newer entrant in the AI research space that’s being acquired by Meta) as the only two products with “a true, generally capable, long-running and really smart agent architecture.” Most other so-called agents, he argues, are merely “LLM powered workflows” – predetermined steps with AI calls mixed in, not true autonomous agents that can course-correct and backtrack.\nIt’s a fine line in a market where everyone is suddenly launching AI agents. OpenAI kicked off 2025 by launching new agent-building tools, while Notion, Harvey, and hundreds of other companies have since added agent functionality. In a market steeped with agent claims, Liu’s insistence that Superagent is different will need to prove itself in practice.\nIn a blog post announcing the product, Liu provides examples of what Superagent can do. Ask it to evaluate Google as a three-year investment opportunity, he writes, and you get a structured assessment with citations to earnings calls, defensibility analysis against OpenAI and Anthropic, and risk factors you hadn’t considered. Ask it to brief you on Wells Fargo’s AI strategy before pitching them, and you get their regulatory posture, recent AI investments, and specific pain points your product addresses. The system pulls from premium data sources like FactSet, Crunchbase, SEC filings, and earnings transcripts.\nThe move caps a transformation for Airtable, which Liu has been repositioning as an “AI-native platform.” Last fall, the company brought in David Azose, formerly the engineering lead for ChatGPT’s business products at OpenAI, as CTO. At the same time, it acquired DeepSky (formerly Gradient), an AI agents startup that had raised $40 million. Superagent will operate semi-independently from Airtable, helmed by DeepSky’s founding trio.\nThe pricing was still being hammered out as of last week, but it sounded poised to follow the emerging AI products playbook: $20 per month per user at the entry tier, up to $200 for power users, with generous inference credits. “We’re not trying to optimize for profit margin right now,” Liu says.\nWhether Superagent becomes the trillion-dollar market Liu envisions or a big bet that doesn’t pan out remains to be seen. The competition is not trivial, and the distinctions Liu draws between “real agents” and the rest may not matter to customers if the others can deliver adequate results faster and cheaper.\nBut for a CEO whose company has lost $7.7 billion in paper valuation while retaining most of its actual capital, the move shows a willingness to bet on the future rather than protect the present. Indeed, Liu has reframed that earlier valuation compression as a recruiting advantage, telling employees they’re getting “equity that’s actually much more attractively priced than the $11 billion valuation” with significant upside if his bets pay off. He has capital for strategic acquisitions and doesn’t need to raise another round.\nAsked if he thinks Superagent is ultimately the bigger opportunity, Liu shrugs — he’s not ruling it out. Airtable “will probably be larger for at least the near term than any new products that we do, including Superagent,” he says. “But I also like being able to bet on Superagent. Optionality is a good thing.”\nThis is Liu’s version of what he calls “wartime” leadership – a term he admits he once eschewed as needlessly violent but now embraces as apt. “Being very fast on the draw to be able to adapt,” he says, is “the most value-creative way to run things right now.” He quickly adds, “It’s also the most exciting way to do things.”\n"

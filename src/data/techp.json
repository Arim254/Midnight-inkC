    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n9:59 AM PST · November 14, 2025\n\nImage Credits:Silas Stein/picture alliance / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nOpenAI says ChatGPT will now ditch the em dashes if you tell it to. The telltale sign that supposedly signals text written by AI has popped up everywhere in recent months, including in school papers, emails, comments, customer service chats, LinkedIn posts, online forums, ad copy, and more. The inclusion of the em dash has led people to criticize those writers for being lazy and turning to an AI chatbot to do their work.\nOf course, many have also argued for the em dash, saying it’s been a part of their writing well before LLMs adopted the punctuation. However, the fact that chatbots couldn’t seem to avoid its use made the so-called “ChatGPT hyphen” a newly objectionable addition to any text, even if they weren’t a reliable signal of content created by generative AI.\nThe problem had stumped OpenAI for some time, as ChatGPT users were unable to get the chatbot to stop using the symbol, even when they specifically asked it not to.\nNow, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company has fixed the problem. In a post on X, Altman writes, “If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do,” calling the update a “small-but-happy win.”\n\nSmall-but-happy win:If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it's supposed to do!— Sam Altman (@sama) November 14, 2025\n\nThe company explains in a post on Threads (where it forced ChatGPT to apologize for “ruining the em dash”) that ChatGPT will be better at not using the em dash if you instruct it not to via the custom instructions in your personalization settings. That means it won’t necessarily eliminate the em dash from its output by default, but you will at least have more control over the frequency of its appearance.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

It includes “Monthly Recaps” that spotlight your top artists, songs, podcasts, and total listening time. Amazon Music users can now share these stats directly to TikTok. \nTikTok already supports “Share to TikTok” features for both Spotify and Apple Music. \nTikTok says the update builds on its current partnership with Amazon Music through its “Add to Music App” feature that allows users to save the songs they discover on TikTok directly to Amazon Music and other leading streaming services. \nThursday’s announcement makes sense for TikTok, an app known for influencing which songs top the charts. By adding Amazon Music to its “Share to TikTok” options, TikTok gains an increased ability to connect users with their favorite songs and artists.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n"

Once sequestered, Charm can sell carbon removal credits to companies. Axios first reported on the startup’s deal with Boeing.\nAviation has made little progress on cutting its carbon emissions. That has left companies in the sector searching for alternatives. Carbon removal has emerged as a contender given that it has the potential to cost less than transitioning to sustainable aviation fuels.\nBy 2050, one study found that the aviation industry will need to spend at least $60 billion on carbon offsets to reach net zero emissions.\nCharm can also produce biochar, a substance that when applied to farm fields can help boost soil productivity, though those efforts are still in their infancy, according to data from carbon removal registry Isometric.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Two years ago, Charm sold 112,000 carbon removal credits to Frontier, the advanced market commitment, for $53 million, or about $470 per metric ton. Charm has said it wants to bring the cost down to about $50 per metric ton.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n"

The tech giant notes that the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires it to give users in Europe the option to chat with people using third-party messaging services that have chosen to make their apps interoperable.\n“Following successful small-scale tests over the past months, the option for WhatsApp users to chat with users of messaging apps BirdyChat and Haiket directly via third-party chats will soon be rolling out across Europe,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “This marks a significant milestone in Meta’s compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements.”\nUsers in Europe who have opted in to the third-party integration will be able to share messages, images, voice messages, videos, and files. The option to create groups with third-party users will launch once Meta’s partners are ready to support it, the company says.\nOver the coming months, users in the European Region will begin seeing a notification in the “Settings” tab that will explain the process of opting in to connect with people on third-party apps. Third-party integrations will only work on Android and iOS, not on desktops, web, or tablets.\nImage Credits:Meta\nOf course, connecting with people on other messaging apps is optional, and users can turn third-party chats on or off at any time.\nMeta says its partnerships with BirdyChat and Haiket are the result of a three-year collaboration with the European messaging services and the European Commission to develop a third-party chat solution that complies with DMA requirements. \nAdditionally, the company notes that third-party messaging must use the same level of end-to-end encryption as WhatsApp. Meta also says it has ensured that users will understand the differences between chats on WhatsApp and third-party chats.\nBack in September 2024, Meta shared what third-party chats on WhatsApp will look like, noting that users will be able to set up a designated folder for third-party messages or opt for a combined inbox. The company also said at the time that it would notify users each time a new third-party messaging app became available. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple on Thursday introduced a new set of App Review Guidelines for developers, which now specifically state that apps must disclose and obtain users’ permission before sharing personal data with third-party AI.\nThe change comes ahead of the iPhone maker’s plan to introduce its own AI-upgraded version of Siri in 2026.\nThat update will see Apple’s digital assistant offer users the ability to take actions across apps using Siri commands, and will be powered, in part, by Google’s Gemini technology, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\nAt the same time, Apple is ensuring other apps aren’t leaking personal data to AI providers or other AI businesses. \nWhat’s interesting about this particular update is not the requirements being described but that Apple has specifically called out AI companies as needing to come into compliance. \nBefore the revised language, the guideline known as rule 5.1.2(i) included language around disclosure and obtaining user consent for data sharing, noting that apps could not “use, transmit or share” someone’s personal data without their permission. This rule served as part of Apple’s compliance with data privacy regulations like the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), California’s Consumer Privacy Act, and others, which ensure that users have more control over how their data is collected and shared. Apps that don’t follow the policy can be removed from the App Store.\nThe newly revised guideline adds the following sentence (emphasis ours): \n\nYou must clearly disclose where personal data will be shared with third parties, including with third-party AI, and obtain explicit permission before doing so.\n\nThis change could impact apps that intend to use AI systems to collect or process information about their users, perhaps to personalize their apps or provide certain functionality. It’s unclear how stringently Apple will enforce the rule, given that the term “AI” could include a variety of technologies — not just LLMs, but also things like machine learning.\nThe updated rule is one of several revisions to the App Review Guidelines out on Thursday. Other changes are focused on supporting Apple’s new Mini Apps Program, also announced today, as well as tweaks to rules involving creator apps, loan apps, and more.\nOne addition also added crypto exchanges to the list of apps that provide services in highly regulated fields.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nApple announced on Thursday the launch of a new developer program, the Mini Apps Partner Program, which will offer a reduced commission rate of 15% on in-app purchases for the mini applications.\nThe iPhone maker defines a mini app as a “self-contained” experience that’s built using web technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript, which are distributed within a larger, native app. The technology has been supported on the App Store for nearly a decade, but this is the first time it’s offered a reduced commission on mini app transactions.\nApple in 2017 added a rule to its App Review Guidelines, which lists the specific requirements for mini apps. In guideline 4.7, the company gives developers permission to run mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators that offer software not in the main app’s binary. It also describes how they’re to process sensitive data or filter objectionable material, similar to native apps.\nTo qualify for the new Mini App program, Apple says the main app must be available on iOS or iPadOS and hosted on the App Store, and will need to follow the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and the existing App Review Guidelines, including those for mini apps.\nHowever, the program also adds the new requirements for the apps to support specific Apple technologies, including the Advanced Commerce API and Declared Age Rating API, which ensures apps offer age-appropriate content. They must also use Apple’s in-app purchase system and send information about a user’s in-app purchase to Apple when refunds are requested.\nApple positions the program as a way for developers who host mini apps and games to grow their business on the App Store. It also incentivizes developers to leverage Apple’s technologies, including its trust and safety tools, by offering the benefit of a reduced commission. That additional savings could allow the developers to re-invest in their own mini apps program.\nIn addition, it ensures that Apple will retain its ability to extract a commission from mini applications, even as the market evolves to offer new experiences. \nToday, there are a variety of native iOS apps that offer mini apps, including messengers like LINE or WeChat, or those that offer mini games, like Discord, for example. More recently, AI providers have begun moving into the mini app space. Notably, ChatGPT recently launched apps that run inside its chatbot, allowing users to engage with apps like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. Some have theorized that this platform could eventually evolve to threaten the App Store’s business model if app engagement and transactions moved inside ChatGPT.\nBloomberg recently reported Apple and Tencent agreed to a 15% commission on mini apps in WeChat, but not that the program would be open to other developers.\nDevelopers who want to join Apple’s Mini Apps Partner Program can make a request, and then provide information about their host app, eligibility, and mini app. They also have to agree to the program’s terms and conditions. When their app is ready, they then have to submit it for review. (Apple already asks app developers to include a manifest that allows Apple to review the software and metadata included in the app, plus the links that lead to the mini apps it offers.)\nIn-app purchases inside mini apps qualify for the reduced commission if they are for digital goods and services, including consumable, non-consumable, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions, Apple says.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nPayment technology company Pine Labs, backed by PayPal and Mastercard, won over public investors on Friday, finishing its first day of trading 14% higher even after lowering its valuation for its $440 million IPO. This makes it the second-largest Indian fintech listing this year after online brokerage Groww’s nearly $750 million debut earlier this week.\nThe stock opened at ₹242 and rose as high as ₹284 before settling at ₹252, up from the issue price of ₹221, resulting in a market capitalization of ₹289 billion (approximately $3.3 billion) for the Gurugram-based company. \nIt’s a step down from Pine Labs’ 2022 private valuation of over $5 billion, but still a clear signal that investors are backing India’s growing push to take its fintech model global.\nFounded in 1998, Pine Labs has been steadily expanding beyond India and now operates in 20 markets, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the UAE, the U.S., and some parts of Africa. What started as a point-of-sale terminal provider has since evolved into a broader payments platform that supports bill payments, account-aggregator transactions, and a range of merchant and acquiring services.\nIn India, Pine Labs competes with the likes of Razorpay, Paytm, and Walmart-owned PhonePe. The company became profitable in the June quarter, posting a net profit of ₹47.86 million (about $540,000), compared with a loss of ₹278.89 million a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 17.9% year-over-year to ₹6.16 billion (around $69 million), while its overseas business contributed roughly 15% of total revenue, rising to ₹943.25 million (about $11 million) from ₹795.97 million a year earlier.\n“We will never stop being a startup,” said Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, during its public listing ceremony. “Now that we are a listed company, [that word] will not be heard in our halls.”\nExisting investors, including Peak XV Partners, Temasek Holdings, PayPal, and Mastercard, were among those who sold part of their holdings in the public listing.\n“Pine Labs never wanted to compete on price,” said Shailendra Singh, managing director at Peak XV Partners. “It always wanted to compete on a superior proposition. And we know this company would keep compounding because there were such strong moats in the business, and it shaped our worldview of how to think about companies and be patient and let ecosystems mature.”\nPeak XV Partners, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, first invested in Pine Labs in 2009 amid the global financial crisis. The VC firm is also seeing back-to-back partial public exits this week, as Pine Labs is its second portfolio company to list after Groww, which debuted on Indian exchanges with a 12% pop and closed its first trading day 29% above its issue price of ₹100.\nPine Labs’ market debut is part of a broader wave, as the public-listing engine in India is revving up. From tech and fintech to e-commerce and manufacturing, more startups are choosing to go public — fueled by strong domestic investor appetite, eased interest-rate conditions, and regulatory nudges to boost listings. Globally, finance has been the top IPO sector this year, with IPOs worth $34.34 billion so far in 2025, more than doubling the $14.05 billion raised over the same period in 2024, according to Dealogic.\nWith its public debut, Pine Labs plans to keep widening its geographic footprint while deepening its presence in India with new products and services aimed at the country’s rapidly expanding, internet-driven consumer base.\n“Our core business will keep expanding. Our moats will be strengthened, and margins will grow,” Rau said.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

But the consequences of self-favoring go far beyond the amount awarded. We will continue to fight – because market abuse must have consequences and must not become a lucrative business model that is worthwhile despite fines and compensation payments,” Idealo’s co-founder and CEO Albrecht von Sonntag said in a statement.\nGoogle said it intends to appeal both rulings. “The changes we made in 2017 are working well, with no intervention from the European Commission. The number of price comparison sites in Europe using the remedy Shopping Unit has multiplied from seven then to 1,550 today,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company added that it offers rival comparison shopping services the same opportunity as Google Shopping to display ads, and said Google Shopping operates as if it were a separate business, participating in auctions the same as everyone else.\nThe ruling follows close on the heels of an EU investigation into how Google’s spam policy affects publishers’ search rankings. The company was recently fined €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion) by the EU for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services. \nNote: This story was updated to add a comment from Google.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "description": "The ChatGPT maker describes this pilot as just a “small first step” toward creating a more \"shared experience\" in the app. The private chats and personal ChatGPT memory stay completely private. Group chats are invitation-only, and members can leave at any time.",
    "body": "\nOpenAI on Thursday introduced a group chat feature for ChatGPT. The feature, currently being tested in select regions, including Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, lets users collaborate directly within the app.\nThe group chat is available to Free, Plus, and Team users on both mobile and web platforms. OpenAI says the pilot is designed to explore how people use group conversations in ChatGPT.\nThe announcement comes after earlier reports that OpenAI had been testing a direct-message-style tool. \nThe ChatGPT maker describes this pilot as just a “small first step” toward creating a more “shared experience” in the app. Early users will be invited to provide feedback, which the company says will help shape how the feature eventually expands to more regions and offerings.\nAccording to OpenAI, private chats and personal ChatGPT memory stay completely private. Group chats are invitation-only, and members can leave at any time. Most participants can remove others, though the group’s creator can only leave voluntarily. For users under 18, content is filtered, with extra safeguards and parental controls in place.\nStarting a group chat is easy. Just tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Groups can include one to 20 people. If you add someone to an existing chat, a new group is created, leaving the original conversation unchanged. Each group has a short profile, and all chats are organized in a labeled sidebar for easy access.\nGroup chats work just like regular ChatGPT conversations but with multiple people joining in.

    "body": "\nIf there’s one thing that VCs agree on when backing AI startups, it’s that AI requires a different investment approach than prior technological shifts.\n“It’s a funky time,” said Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. The longtime VC noted that the rules of investing have significantly shifted now that some AI companies are leaping from “zero to $100 million in revenue in a single year.”\nHowever, Lee also noted that, based on her firm’s research, Series A investors aren’t just seeking rapid revenue growth. “It’s an algorithm with different variables and different coefficients.”\nSome of the factors investors now measure, according to Lee, include whether the startup is generating data, the strength of its competitive moat, the founders’ past accomplishments, and the technical depth of the product. “Depending on what your company is, the output of the algorithmic formula is going to be different,” she said.\nJon McNeill, co-founder and CEO of startup creation firm DVx Ventures, stated that even startups that grow rapidly from inception to $5 million in revenue often struggle to secure follow-on funding. “I think this game has changed, and it is changing dynamically,” he said.\nMcNeill noted that Series A investors are now applying the same rigorous standards to seed-stage startups that they previously reserved for more mature companies.\n“I think a lot of investors have figured out that the breakout companies, in most cases, don’t have the best tech,” McNeill said about why Series A VCs are looking so closely at startups’ ability to attract and retain customers. “They have the best go-to market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSteve Jang, founder and managing partner of Kindred Ventures, disagreed that a strong go-to-market (GTM), an industry term for sales and marketing, holds greater weight for investors. “I don’t think it’s 100% true to say mediocre technology, great GTM wins and raises money and gets customers. I think that it’s a necessary requirement to have both.”\nWhile McNeill later clarified that having a solid product is important, he indicated that his initial comment was related to the founders’ need to develop an exceptionally strong sales and marketing strategy right out of the gate. “Investors are getting much more sophisticated on the go-to market than they have in the past,” he said.\n(The debate over marketing versus tech was brought to the forefront later during the conference when Roy Lee, founder of the viral startup Cluely, said onstage that launching a product that barely worked, even with massive social media fame, may not always be the best idea.)\nAileen Lee added that AI startups are now under pressure to deliver product updates and new features at an unprecedented pace, preempting existing companies that might try to introduce similar products.  “If you look at how much OpenAI and Anthropic are shipping, you’re going to have to figure out how to match how much you ship, how quickly and the quality of it,” she said.\nDespite the expectations for breakneck growth and fast product development, panelists agreed that the AI industry is still in its very early stages. As Jang put it, “There are no clear, outright winners, even in LLMs. There are competitors nipping at their heels.”\nThis means startups still have a path to unseating perceived leaders, whether they are decades-old companies or fast-moving newcomers.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen the hosts of the popular All-In podcast launched their own tequila brand at a star-studded party last June, all 750 bottles of the $1,200 spirit quickly sold out. But getting those bottles into customers’ hands has proven harder than expected.\nThe long-awaited bottles of Besties All-In tequila began shipping last week to those who ordered them, ending a nearly five-month-long wait, Jason Calacanis, one of the podcast’s hosts, told TechCrunch. \nThe holdup was the unusual bottle, Calacanis said: “Handcrafted bottles took a bit longer to create than expected, but the bottles started shipping last week!” The bottle was designed as a collector item and looks like a stack of poker chips illuminated from the bottom. It gives homage to poker, another of the podcast hosts’ favorite pastimes besides drinking tequila.\nBuyers were told at that time that they could expect delivery by the end of summer. But summer came and went. The customers not only dished out the $1,200 but also paid taxes and other fees.  \nA TechCrunch reader told us that delivery was repeatedly delayed: pushed back to October, then November, and most recently, one person was told the delivery would be “after November,” according to a letter seen by TechCrunch from the distributor Flaviar, the spirits marketplace handling distribution.\nBoth the product’s official website and Flaviar’s communications reflected the shifting timeline — the website originally promised end-of-summer delivery but now says shipments will “begin in November.” The Flaviar letter indicated that deliveries were happening in batches.\nWhile it’s still not clear how long it will take the distributor to fulfill all orders, we at least know that shipments have begun and what the holdup was. With any luck, fans of the VCs, pod bros, and “besties” who host All-In will be sipping on the pricey, handcrafted liquor during the upcoming holiday season.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFlaviar has not yet responded to our request for comment.  \n"

    "body": "\nUber has quietly begun piloting in-app video recording for its drivers in India, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company. The tool is meant to deter misconduct in a market where most drivers do not use dashcams, according to Uber.\nHalf a dozen Uber drivers in the Delhi–NCR region told TechCrunch they sometimes face misconduct from riders and, in some cases, are threatened with false complaints about their behavior — allegations that can lead to penalties or even account suspensions.\n“Even female passengers traveling late at night insist that we follow the route they want instead of what’s shown on the map. If we refuse, they threaten to file false complaints,” said one driver, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing his account.\nDrivers said the in-app video recording feature could help protect them in such situations by providing evidence when disputes arise. Still, some questioned whether Uber would back them in cases involving riders, noting that passengers pay for the trip and can easily switch to competing platforms if dissatisfied.\nThe pilot, which began rolling out in phases in May, is now live in 10 cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.\nRiders receive an in-trip notification when video recording is active.\nUber’s notification for in-app video recording.Image Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n“All recordings are double-encrypted, stored on the device, and cannot be accessed by anyone — including Uber — unless a user chooses to share them as part of a safety report,” an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the recordings are automatically deleted after a week if they are not shared.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe video tool builds on Uber’s in-app audio recording feature, which launched in India in 2023. Video recording was first tested in the U.S. in 2022 and is already available in Canada and Brazil.\nAs the pilot expands, Uber will have to balance the feature’s potential to defuse disputes with broader questions about privacy and surveillance in one of its prominent markets. It is unclear when the video recording tool will be rolled out more widely, though the pilot’s performance in the coming months is likely to shape whether Uber extends it across India or to other regions.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:beehiiv\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:50 AM PST · November 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nNewsletter platform beehiiv announced a massive expansion to its platform on Thursday, including offering real-time analytics and AI website creation, among other things. \nIn a video announcing the release, Tyler Denk, the co-founder and CEO of beehiiv, said that what makes newsletter platforms powerful is ownership. \n“Owning your audience, distribution, brand, and even your revenue potential,” he said. “In the age of AI and algorithms. Ownership isn’t just nice to have, it’s essential.”\nThe hope is to further give creators (and journalists) more control — and opportunities — to expand and grow their businesses on the platform.  \nThe full product expansion includes: \n\n Allowing creators to sell digital products, such as e-books, without beehiiv receiving commissions. Next year, creators will soon be able to sell courses and merchandise. \n\n\nA feature that lets creators build websites using AI without the use of sophisticated code or developers. A version product was actually launched a few months ago and followed beehiiv’s acquisition of the AI website builder Typedream last year.   Thursday’s announcement revealed the product now lets users build full websites by simply chatting with AI — or, vibe code a website. However, users don’t need to simply talk in words to the AI; they can also drag and drop images, for example, upload images or screenshots of other people’s websites to the AI, and have it re-create them.\n\n\nThe ability to host and release podcasts on a creator’s respective beehiive platform. This lets creators put their podcasts, newsletters, and websites under one platform, rather than having three separate ones. \n\n\nReal-time analytics to track engagement and traffic, in addition to a breakdown of what channels drive the most users. \n\n\nOffering “link in bio,” so creators can link to other digital platforms, as well as their own beehiiv creations, without having to use a third-party link-in-bio company.  \nOffering professionally designed website templates, so that the website and newsletters look more high-quality. It’s also releasing newsletter templates so that websites and newsletters can have a cohesive brand look. \n\n\nThe ability to audience segment — meaning creators can create specific content for specific segments of their audience. Creators can now group followers by location, age, or even gender.   \n\n\nAutomated workflows — for example, when a user subscribes, creators can set it up so that a welcome email is automatically sent to them. beehiiv started releasing features of automated workflows a few weeks ago. \n\n\nEnhanced advertiser tools, including easier browsing of ad opportunities and seeing estimated payouts. Denk said that creators can upload assets, set a budget, and launch campaigns on the platform. In addition, beehiiv has a new ad dashboard, letting creators track the performance of their campaigns and build their own custom reports.  \n\n\nPaid subscriptions, without any fees taken by beehiiv (it says it is the only platform that doesn’t take a cut of paid subscription revenue). The feature comes with subscription tiers and analytics. \n\nBeehiiv now considers itself the first platform to encapsulate the entire content-creation workflow, as users on the platform can “create, publish, grow, analyze, and monetize,” without fees, plugins, code, or giving up equity.\nIn the video, Denk said that beehiiv is no longer just a newsletter platform, but rather the operating system for the creator economy. With this expansion, it hopes to compete with the likes of Lovable, WordPress, and Patreon. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company was founded in 2021 and says that since then, it has sent more than 35 billion emails, with more than 55,000 creators on the platform, including Oliver Darcy with Status. Beehiiv last raised a $33 million Series B in April 2024 with Lightspeed Venture Partners and NEA as investors.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Authorities from nine countries took down three cybercrime operations, including the Rhadamantys infostealer, which allegedly had access to the crypto wallets of more than 100,000 victims.",
    "body": "\nAn international coalition of law enforcement agencies coordinated by Europol targeted and took down three cybercrime operations in its latest round of what authorities call “Operation Endgame.”\nIn a press release, Europol said that the police operation targeted the infostealing malware Rhadamanthys, a botnet called Elysium, and the remote access trojan VenomRAT. The authorities say all three “played a key role in international cybercrime.” Police seized more than 1,000 servers as part of the operation. \nEuropol said police arrested the unnamed “main suspect” behind VenomRAT in Greece on November 3.\n“The dismantled malware infrastructure consisted of hundreds of thousands of infected computers containing several million stolen credentials,” the press release read. “Many of the victims were not aware of the infection of their systems.”\nAccording to Europol, the main suspect behind Rhadamantys had access to over 100,000 crypto wallets, “potentially worth millions of euros.”\nAs an infostealer, Rhadamantys is designed to steal various kinds of information from infected devices, including passwords and cryptocurrency wallet keys. Rhadamantys spiked in popularity in October after authorities took down the popular infostealer Lumma earlier in the year, showing that after takedowns, criminals adapt by using different hacking tools that might be less known at the time.\nWhen Rhadamantys launched in 2022, it initially relied on spreading through malicious Google advertisements, and later grew thanks to word-of-mouth on underground forums, according to Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs, one of the cybersecurity industry partners in Operation Endgame. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm wrote in a blog post that Rhadamantys had a “dramatic uptick” and a “consistent rise in the number of victims” after the Lumma takedown, making it “the largest information-stealer malware by volume.” In October, the infostealer had compromised more than 12,000 victims, according to the firm.\nRyan English, a researcher at Black Lotus Labs, told TechCrunch that Rhadamantys “emerged as the ‘next’ go-to infostealer” after Lumma went down.\n“We know that others will take their place, so we just keep tracking to see who’s emerging from that,” said English, adding that law enforcement and the wider industry “can only do so much at any time.” \n“So in a very real sense, it’s whack-a-mole forever,” said English.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice said five people — including four U.S. nationals — \"facilitated\" North Korean IT workers to get jobs at American companies, allowing the regime to earn money from their remote labor.",
    "body": "\nFive people have pleaded guilty to helping North Koreans defraud U.S. companies by posing as remote IT workers, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday.\nThe five people are accused of working as “facilitators” who helped North Koreans get jobs by providing their own real identities, or false and stolen identities of more than a dozen U.S. nationals. The facilitators also hosted company-provided laptops in their homes across the U.S. to make it look like the North Korean workers lived locally, according to the DOJ press release.\nThese actions affected 136 U.S. companies and netted Kim Jong Un’s regime $2.2 million in revenue, said the DOJ.\nThe latest round of guilty pleas is part of a years-long effort by American authorities to disrupt North Korea’s ability to make money from cybercrime. For years, North Korea has successfully infiltrated hundreds of Western companies posing as remote IT workers — as well as investors and recruiters — as part of a scheme to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program. In recent years, the U.S. government has fought back, indicting people involved in the scheme, and imposing sanctions on international fraud networks. \n“These prosecutions make one point clear: the United States will not permit [North Korea] to bankroll its weapons programs by preying on American companies and workers,” U.S. Attorney Jason A. Reding Quiñones said in a press release. “We will keep working with our partners across the Justice Department to uncover these schemes, recover stolen funds, and pursue every individual who enables North Korea’s operations.”\nThree of the people — U.S. nationals Audricus Phagnasay, Jason Salazar, and Alexander Paul Travis — each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy. \nProsecutors accused the three of helping North Koreans posing as legitimate IT workers, whom they knew worked outside of the United States, to use their own identities to obtain employment, helped them remotely access their company-issued laptops set up in their homes, and also helped the North Koreans pass vetting procedures, such as drug tests. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTravis, who prosecutors said was an active servicemember of the U.S. Army at the time of the scheme, earned more than $50,000 for these actions, while Phagnasay and Salazar were paid at least $3,500 and $4,500, respectively. The scheme saw U.S. companies pay around $1.28 million in salaries, most of which was sent to the North Korean IT workers overseas, per the DOJ.\nThe fourth U.S. national who pleaded guilty is Erick Ntekereze Prince, who ran a company called Taggcar, which supplied to U.S. companies allegedly “certified” IT workers but whom he knew worked outside of the country and were using stolen or fake identities. Prince also hosted laptops with remote access software at several residences in Florida, and earned more than $89,000 for his work, the DOJ said. \nAnother participant in the scheme who pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy and another count of aggravated identity theft is Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko, who prosecutors accuse of stealing U.S. citizens’ identities and selling them to North Koreans so they could get jobs at more than 40 U.S. companies. \nAccording to the press release, Didenko earned hundreds of thousands of dollars for this service. Didenko agreed to forfeit $1.4 million as part of his guilty plea.\nThe DOJ also announced that it had frozen and seized more than $15 million in cryptocurrency stolen in 2023 by North Korean hackers from several crypto platforms. \nCrypto companies, exchanges, and blockchain projects, have become one of the favorite targets for North Korean hackers, who stole more than $650 million in crypto in 2024, and more than $2 billion so far this year.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

Bajaj also co-founded Verily, a biotech startup owned by Alphabet, and is the co-founder of Foresite Labs, an AI-focused affiliate of investment firm Foresite Capital, though the report notes he recently left the firm to start Prometheus, the report said.\nBezos would be returning to operations for the first time since he stepped away from Amazon in 2021.\nAccording to the NYT, the startup is going to build AI products for engineering and manufacturing in various fields like computers, aerospace, and automobiles. Project Prometheus is focused on “AI for the physical economy,” per its LinkedIn page, and the report noted that its work will resemble that of Periodic Labs, which is building technology to speed up scientific research by simulating the physical world to train AI models.\nThe company already has almost 100 staff, including researchers from AI firms like Meta, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, the report said.\nAmazon and Bajaj did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

Now, Ford is joining in with a certified used car twist.\nFord announced Monday that customers will be able to shop for, finance, and purchase certified pre-owned Ford vehicles on Amazon Autos. The partnership still keeps dealerships — a key revenue driver for Ford — in the loop. Customers can browse a participating local dealer’s inventory directly through Amazon’s website, complete most of the paperwork online, and then schedule a time to pick up the selected vehicle, according to Ford.\nFord said any certified pre-owned vehicle sold by dealers on Amazon Autos comes with a money-back guarantee. Customers can return the vehicle within 14 days or 1,000 miles, whichever comes first.\nAmazon Autos functions like the rest of the broader Amazon e-commerce ecosystem. Shoppers can search for available vehicles from participating dealers by model, trim, color, and features. Customers can also secure financing and e-sign paperwork via the Amazon Autos site. \nWhen Amazon Autos launched last year, it was focused on new car sales, namely Hyundai. The addition of Ford opens up a different, although related, market of certified pre-owned vehicles.\nFord vehicles on Amazon Autos will initially be offered in just a few markets, including Los Angeles, Seattle, and Dallas. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

Every few months, Ramp has raised another large sum at another giant new valuation. On Monday, the fintech announced it had raised $300 million led by Lightspeed, which also included an employee tender offer.\nThis is just a few months after a $500 million Series E-2 at a $22.5 billion valuation led by Iconiq, announced on July 30. That round was just a few weeks after a $200 million Series E at a $16 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, announced in mid-June. And that Series E was just three months after a $150 million secondary share sale at a $13 billion valuation in March.  \nIn April 2024, Ramp had raised a $150 million Series D co-led by Khosla and Founders Fund at a $7.65 billion valuation. \nWith Monday’s round, Ramp has raised $2.3 billion in total equity financing, it says. And in 2025 alone, the company leapt from being worth $13 billion to $32 billion. \nRamp in October said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, meaning it was on a trajectory to bring in that much on a 12-month basis. \nRamp today offers corporate expense management. While it has an AI story to tell — automating some approvals and processes via agentic offerings — it is not an AI company per se. It offers corporate credit cards, expense management/purchase order software, and corporate travel. The company says it has surpassed 50,000 customers.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Startups\n"

    "body": "\nApple is getting serious about succession planning, according to a new report in The Financial Times.\nThe company’s board and senior executives are reportedly preparing for the possibility that Tim Cook could step down as CEO as soon as early next year. This would come after Apple’s earnings report in late January, giving the new leadership team time to settle into their roles before Apple’s big events like the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\nThe 65-year-old Cook has been Apple’s chief executive since Steve Jobs resigned in 2011; he’s now served as CEO for longer than Jobs. Under his leadership, Apple has grown from a market capitalization of $350 billion to $4 trillion, although the company has apparently struggled to find the right direction with AI.\nNo final decisions have been made about Cook’s successor or the timing of his departure, the FT says. However, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus is reportedly seen as the most likely candidate for the company’s next CEO.\n"

    "body": "\nThree years ago, Luminal co-founder Joe Fioti was working on chip design at Intel when he came to a realization. While he was working on making the best chips he could, the more important bottleneck was in software.\n“You can make the best hardware on earth, but if it’s hard for developers to use, they’re just not going to use it,” he told me.\nNow, he’s started a company that focuses entirely on that problem. On Monday, Luminal announced $5.3 million in seed funding, in a round led by Felicis Ventures with angel investment from Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, and Ben Porterfield. \nFioti’s co-founders, Jake Stevens and Matthew Gunton, come from Apple and Amazon, respectively, and the company was part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch.\nLuminal’s core business is simple: the company sells compute, just like neo-cloud companies like Coreweave or Lambda Labs. But where those companies focus on GPUs, Luminal has focused on optimization techniques that let the company squeeze more compute out of the infrastructure it has. In particular, the company focuses on optimizing the compiler that sits between written code and the GPU hardware — the same developer systems that caused Fioti so many headaches in his previous job.\nAt the moment, the industry’s leading compiler is Nvidia’s CUDA system — an underrated element in the company’s runaway success. But many elements of CUDA are open-source, and Luminal is betting that, with many in the industry still scrambling for GPUs, there will be a lot of value to be gained in building out the rest of the stack.\nIt’s part of a growing cohort of inference-optimization startups, which have grown more valuable as companies look for faster and cheaper ways to run their models. Inference providers like Baseten and Together AI have long specialized in optimization, and smaller companies like Tensormesh and Clarifai are now popping up to focus on more specific technical tricks.\nLuminal and other members of the cohort will face stiff competition from optimization teams at major labs, which have the benefit of optimizing for a single family of models. Working for clients, Luminal has to adapt to whatever model comes their way. But even with the risk of being out-gunned by the hyperscalers, Fioti says the market is growing fast enough that he’s not worried.\n“It is always going to be possible to spend six months hand tuning a model architecture on a given hardware, and you’re probably going to beat any sorts of, any sort of compiler performance,” Fioti says. “But our big bet is that anything short of that, the all-purpose use case is still very economically valuable.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The tech giant is expanding availability for its AI-powered “Flight Deals” tool, adding the ability for users to organize travel plans with its “Canvas” tool in AI Mode, and launching agentic booking capabilities to more people.\nGoogle first launched Flight Deals back in August in the U.S., Canada, and India. Now, the company is expanding the AI-powered search tool within Google Flights globally to help people quickly find affordable destinations.\nTo get started, users need to describe where, when, and how they want to travel. Flight Deals will then use AI to display the best bargains available. \nFlight Deals is now rolling out to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including the U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea. The tool is also getting support for more than 60 languages.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the new AI Mode features, Google says users can now use the built-in Canvas tool to create travel plans. Canvas, which first launched as a way to build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel, can now help users plan their upcoming trips.\nUsers need to tell AI mode what type of trip they’re looking for and then select the “Create with Canvas” option. \n“Right away, you’ll get a plan in the Canvas side panel that brings together real-time Search data for flights and hotels, details from Google Maps like photos and reviews and relevant information from sites across the web,” Google explained in a blog post. “You’ll find suggestions that fit your criteria, like hotel comparisons based on pricing and amenities or ideas for restaurants and activities optimized by travel time from where you’re staying.”\nUsers can then ask follow-up questions and get help with tradeoffs, like choosing a hotel that’s closer to a brunch place you want to try but a bit farther from the hiking trails you want to explore.\nImage Credits:Google\nTravel planning with Canvas is available on desktop in the U.S. for users who are opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs.\nAdditionally, Google announced that it’s bringing AI Mode’s agentic capabilities to more people. Earlier this year, Google announced that users who were opted into Labs could now get help with booking restaurant reservations, event tickets, and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Now, the company is making this capability available to all U.S. users. \nUsers can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. AI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from.\nIn the future, Google says it will make it possible to finish booking flights and hotels directly in AI Mode. Users will be able to describe what they’re looking for and then compare different flights or hotels and browse information like schedules, prices, room photos, amenities, and reviews. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs U.S. giants like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic race to develop the large language models that underpin their AI products, startups such as Sakana AI, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, and AI21 Labs are carving out their own niche with specialized models designed for specific regions, industries, or unique features.\nIn pursuit of that goal, Tokyo-based Sakana AI has closed a ¥20 billion (approximately $135 million) Series B funding round, which values the company at $2.65 billion post-money, up from a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, CEO David Ha told TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito, and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.\nThe Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital, and In-Q-Tel (IQT).\n“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.\nHa, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.\nLooking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence, and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships, and M&A for long-term global growth.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSakana says it sees strong global demand for sovereign AI solutions that reflect “national cultures and values.” The Japanese startup added that focusing its R&D efforts on AI products after LLMs are trained helps it efficiently build advanced models tailored to Japan, taking a path distinct from the large-scale AI model race.\nThis funding round comes roughly a year after the company’s Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation. Sakana had raised roughly $244 million in total as of March 2025, according to PitchBook, so this round would take that total to about $379 million.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "description": "The defacement of Protei's website said \"another DPI/SORM provider bites the dust,\" apparently referring to the company selling its web intercept and surveillance products to phone and internet providers.",
    "body": "\nA Russian telecom company that develops technology to allow phone and internet companies to conduct web surveillance and censorship was hacked, had its website defaced, and had data stolen from its servers, TechCrunch has learned.\nFounded in Russia, Protei makes telecommunications systems for phone and internet providers across dozens of countries, including Bahrain, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan and much of central Africa. The company, now headquartered in Jordan, sells video conferencing technology and internet connectivity solutions, as well as surveillance equipment and web-filtering products, such as deep packet inspection systems.\nIt’s not clear exactly when or how Protei was hacked, but a copy of the company’s website saved on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows it was defaced on November 8. The website was restored soon after.\nDuring the breach, the hacker obtained the contents of Protei’s web server — around 182 gigabytes of files — including emails dating back years.\nA copy of Protei’s data was provided to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit transparency collective that indexes leaked datasets in the public interest, including data from law enforcement, government agencies, and companies involved in the surveillance industry.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nMohammad Jalal, the managing director of Protei’s branch in Jordan, did not respond to a request for comment about the breach. \nThe identity of the hacker is not known, nor their motivations, but the defaced website read: “another DPI/SORM provider bites the dust.” The message likely references the company’s sales of deep packet inspection systems and other internet filtering technology for the Russian-developed lawful intercept system known as SORM.\nSORM is the main lawful intercept system used across Russia as well as several other countries that use Russian technology. Phone and internet providers install SORM equipment on their networks, which allows their country’s governments to obtain the contents of calls, text messages, and web browsing data of the networks’ customers. \nDeep-packet inspection devices allow telecom companies to identify and filter web traffic depending on its source, such as a social media website or a specific messaging app, and selectively block access.

    "body": "\nNetworking giant Cisco has acquired EzDubs, a Y Combinator-backed consumer startup that provides real-time translation services. Cisco announced the acquisition over the weekend, but the company didn’t disclose the size of the deal.\nEzDubs was founded by Padmanabhan Krishnamurthy, Amrutavarsh Kinagi, and Kareem Nassar in 2023. Notably, Nassar had previously worked at Cisco’s Speech AI group before co-founding the startup. The company raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Venture Highway, which was founded by Neeraj Arora, who was previously WhatsApp’s chief business officer. Other investors in EzDubs include Replit CEO Amjad Masad; Replit President Michele Catasta; Qasar Younis, who is CEO of the autonomous vehicle software company Applied Intuition; and Ben Firshman, CEO of the cloud startup Replicate (which was itself acquired by Cloudflare in a deal that was announced on Monday).\nCisco said it plans to integrate EzDubs’ tech into its communication platform, Cisco Collaboration, which spans hardware and software. This means users can get features like live translation in products like Webex video calling and messaging. Cisco’s blog post also indicated that it could make the translation tech — which preserves the speaker’s original voice — available to partners and developers.\n“The EzDubs team will join Cisco Collaboration, working side-by-side with our product, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Together, we will chart a new course for the industry, one where AI doesn’t just support collaboration, but truly empowers it,” Snorre Kjesbu, SVP of Collaboration at Cisco, said in the post.\nCisco didn’t clarify whether all members of EzDubs’ team are joining the company. We have asked the company to clarify and will update the story if we hear back.\nEzDubs is sunsetting its consumer apps, which supported call translations for more than 30 languages, by December 15. \n“From launching the world’s first video dubbing tool that garnered millions of views on X (fka Twitter) to enabling real-time, voice and emotion preserving phone call translation across 30+ languages, this journey has been extraordinary. But what has truly meant the most is the support, feedback, and stories you’ve shared along the way,” the startup said in a blog post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, there have been a few acquisitions in the translation space. This month, Seven Seven Six-backed Palabra AI acquired live communication platform Talo. In July, language localization company TransPerfect acquired Unbabel, a translation startup founded in Portugal.\nEzDubs’ acquisition also raises the question of whether it’s viable to build a translation focused on consumers when there is more money and demand in the enterprise communication market. According to various reports, the translation services market is valued at approximately $40 billion.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "description": "PowerLattice, a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%.",
    "body": "\nIf you pay attention to what the biggest tech companies are saying about AI demand, you’ll notice a common thread: they’re running short of compute capacity. That means the large language models underpinning AI products today need even more data centers to be trained and for inferencing, and therefore, they need more power. Against that backdrop, energy efficiency has suddenly become a critical priority for semiconductor manufacturers. \nPowerLattice, a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%. On Monday, the startup emerged from stealth with a $25 million Series A funding round led by Playground Global and Celesta Capital, bringing its total funding to $31 million.\n“This is the hard stuff: How do you get power into the device? There are very few teams and people that can do it,” said Pat Gelsinger, general partner at Playground Global. “We have assembled what I’d argue is the dream team of power delivery.”\nAs the former CEO of Intel, Gelsinger carries significant authority in the semiconductor world, which makes his participation a powerful stamp of approval for PowerLattice.\nIn fact, when the startup’s CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground’s offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger’s fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice’s technology.\nThe startup’s tech sounds simple in concept: a tiny power delivery chiplet that’s designed to bring power closer to the processor, significantly minimizing energy loss.\nTwo years in, PowerLattice has already achieved its first key milestone: Its first batch of chiplets is being produced by TSMC, in partnership with an unnamed manufacturer that is testing the startup’s functionality, Gelsinger said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeyond its initial customer, the startup plans to make its product available for testing by other customers in the first half of 2026. The trials should prove instructive, given that PowerLattice’s potential customer set includes major chip manufacturers Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, as well as specialized AI chip developers, such as Cerberus, Grok, and Playground-backed startups d-Matrix and NextSilicon.\nAlthough every chip company has internal teams working on improving energy efficiency, Gelsinger hopes that PowerLattice’s innovative approach will pique their interest.\n“They may say, ‘I’m going to take some volume to this approach, some volume to my more traditional approach’,” he said. “But we think our ability to capture meaningful share will quickly emerge.”\nPowerLattice is not the only startup attempting to help chip manufacturers address the energy problem. The company would compete most closely with Empower Semiconductor, a startup that raised a $140 million Series D, led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, in September.\nHowever, Gelsinger is certain that PowerLattice’s 50% energy efficiency gain is an “extraordinary” result, and he expects the company to soon raise a much larger funding round to fund production.\n“The idea is bold, the benefits are large, and I expect others will be saying, ‘That’s a great idea. Let me try as well,’” Gelsinger said.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFacebook creators are getting a new tool to help them protect their work from being ripped off by others. On Monday, Meta introduced Facebook content protection, a mobile tool designed to detect when a creator’s original reels posted to Facebook are being used without their permission.\nIf the creator is alerted that someone else is using their reels, they’ll also have the ability to block the reel’s visibility across both Facebook and Instagram or track the reel’s performance and optionally add attribution links to their work.\nOr they can opt to release their claim on the reel, allowing it to remain visible on Meta’s platforms. \nMeta says the addition of the content protection feature is part of its work to help original creators succeed on Facebook, without being drowned out by copycats. As part of this initiative, Meta said in July it had taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators and had taken action against 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement.\nImage Credits:Meta\nAlthough the new system also works to protect original content that’s posted on Instagram, it requires that creators post their reels to Facebook to have them tracked. This also works if the creator is using the cross-posting option from Instagram to “Share to Facebook.” \nThe move could encourage more creators to share their work on Facebook as a result.\nThe new content protection system is automatically being provided to Facebook creators in its Facebook Content Monetization program who also meet enhanced integrity and originality standards, the company says. In addition, access to the new program is rolling out to creators who use Rights Manager. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nCreators can see if they’re eligible by looking for notifications in their Feed, Professional Dashboard, and profile, or they can check to see if they have access to the tool from their Professional Dashboard, under “Content Protection.” They can also apply for access on Facebook’s website.\nTo work, the tool uses the same matching technology as is currently used by Meta’s Rights Manager for copyright holders. It will also show the percentage match for each match it surfaces, as well as other details, like views, follower count, and monetization status. \nThe company says it’s giving creators control over if and how the system flags matches. For instance, if the creator has given permission to another account to use their content, they can add them to an “allow list” so those duplicate reels aren’t automatically flagged.\nImage Credits:Meta\nCreators can also release their claim on a video on a one-off basis, or, if they choose to track the performance of a reel on another creator’s account, they can opt to add attribution links. These links will add an “original” label to the reel that links back to the creator’s profile, page, or, in some cases, the original reel itself. \nMeta tells us it’s currently running tests for linking back to the original reel, but linking to the page or profile is the default.\nIf they block the reel, its distribution is impacted, but the account that stole the reel doesn’t receive any disciplinary action. This could be because Meta doesn’t want the system abused to target specific accounts. In addition, it says that if creators abuse the system, creators submitting false reports could see restrictions against their own accounts or they could lose access to the tool.\nTracking reels is the default setting, Facebook notes. \nCreators will also be able to dispute instances where another account tries to protect a piece of the creator’s original work. To do so, creators can submit a copyright takedown request through the IP reporting channel. (They can also submit a report if they find a match that the tool didn’t surface, via a “Can’t find a specific match?” option on the content protection overview screen.) \nFor the time being, the new tool is mobile-only, but Meta tells TechCrunch it’s testing adding it to the Professional Dashboard on the desktop. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSwedish automaker Volvo has canceled a five-year-old contract with Luminar, the latest escalation in an increasingly ugly brawl between the lidar sensor company and its biggest customer.\nThe fight is happening during an existential moment for Luminar. The company recently defaulted on several of its loans. While it’s working with those lenders on a resolution, Luminar has warned investors it may have to declare bankruptcy.\nTo stave that off, Luminar recently laid off 25% of its staff and is trying to sell itself — or parts of itself — to potential buyers. One of them is Luminar founder Austin Russell, who resigned from the CEO role in May during an ethics inquiry. Luminar is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, recent filings reveal.\n“Volvo Cars has made this decision to limit the company’s supply chain risk exposure and it is a direct result of Luminar’s failure to meet its contractual obligations to Volvo Cars,” the automaker said in a statement to TechCrunch. Luminar did not respond to a request for comment.\nVolvo is not just a Luminar customer. The two companies have spent much of the last decade working together. Volvo invested in Luminar and helped the Florida-based startup get into some of its first production vehicles. \nThe relationship has been mutually beneficial. Luminar’s tech gave Volvo the confidence to dish out big promises about making the roads safer by offering automated driving features. Volvo gave Luminar credibility ahead of a 2020 SPAC merger that made Russell one of the youngest self-made billionaires ever.\nBut Luminar has faced challenges as a public company. It struggled to diversify away from Volvo, and in 2024 cut a fifth of its staff while deciding to outsource manufacturing of its sensors. Then, in May of this year, Russell abruptly resigned as Luminar revealed its board had opened a “code of business conduct and ethics” inquiry. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe fight with Volvo bubbled to the surface on October 31. \nThe company told shareholders in a regulatory filing on that day that Volvo decided to no longer make Luminar’s “Iris” lidar a standard sensor on its EX90 and ES90 vehicles. Volvo also told Luminar that it had “deferred” the decision of whether to include its next-generation “Halo” sensor in the Swedish automaker’s future vehicles.\nLuminar said in the filing that it had “made a claim against Volvo for significant damages” and “suspended further commitments of Iris” for the automaker. \n“The Company is in discussions with Volvo concerning the dispute; however, there can be no assurance that the dispute will be resolved favorably or at all,” Luminar wrote.\nVolvo told TechCrunch Monday that its “products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars’ powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set — with or without a lidar.” But, it added, the “situation has an effect on some customer orders.” It did not immediately explain whether that meant a delay, or something else.\nVolvo’s decisions were not just a threat to Luminar’s revenue — they also had knock-on effects for Luminar. In the October filing, Luminar said it stopped spending money on Iris sensors for Volvo, and in turn, the supplier that makes the sensors claimed this was a breach of their agreement.\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volvo. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "body": "\nA pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target. \nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature. \nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley. \nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the  emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works. \n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act. \nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.  \n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

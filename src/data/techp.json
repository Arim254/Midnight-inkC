    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n6:28 AM PST · December 15, 2025\n\nImage Credits:David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nAfter successfully lobbying the Trump administration to approve the sale of its H200 chips to China, Nvidia is now thinking of ramping up production of the chips as Chinese companies rush to place orders, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources.\nThe most powerful of Nvidia’s previous Hopper generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) made for training large language models, the H200 chips previously could not be sold in China, as the previous Biden administration had proposed rules limiting sales of advanced AI chips in the country. But the Department of Commerce last week gave Nvidia the nod to sell H200 GPUs in China, in exchange for a 25% cut of sales of those chips. \nNvidia is now seeing such strong demand from Chinese companies that it is considering adding more capacity, Reuters reported. However, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow the import of the H200 chips, which are said to be significantly more powerful than the H20 GPUs Nvidia had customized to sell in China.\nFor the chipmaker, expanding production of the H200 GPUs would let it tap latent demand in a country that is racing to develop its own homegrown AI chips. Competition and national security concerns in the West have hampered the availability of the latest and most powerful hardware for training AI models in China, where companies have resorted to focusing on efficiency over sheer scale.\nChinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, which are developing their own AI models, have already been in touch with Nvidia to figure out large orders for the H200 chips, which are being produced in limited quantities, the report added.\n“We are managing our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

    "body": "\nGrok, the chatbot built by Elon Musk’s xAI and popularized on his social media platform X, appears to have repeatedly spread misinformation about today’s mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Australia.\nGizmodo pointed to a number of posts where Grok misidentified the bystander — 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed — who disarmed one of the gunmen, and where it questioned the authenticity of videos and photos capturing al Ahmed’s actions.\nIn one post, the chatbot misidentified the man in a photo as an Israeli hostage, and in another post brought up irrelevant information about the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians. In another post, it claimed a “43-year-old IT professional and senior solutions architect” named Edward Crabtree was the one who actually disarmed a gunman.\nGrok does appear to be fixing some of its mistakes. At least one post that reportedly claimed a video of the shooting actually showed Cyclone Alfred has been corrected “upon reevaluation.”\nAnd the chatbot subsequently acknowledged al Ahmed’s identity, writing that the “misunderstanding arises from viral posts that mistakenly identified him as Edward Crabtree, possibly due to a reporting error or a joke referencing a fictional character.” (The article in question appeared on a largely non-functional news site that may be AI-generated.)\n"

    "body": "\nAI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past twelve months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”\nThe dictionary defines the term as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.” \n“Like slime, sludge, and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology.\n“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”\nThe word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials—even entire movies. One study in May claimed that nearly 75 percent of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI.\nThese new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content can be milked for advertising money. Critics worry that this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them up into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which—as you might imagine—can be quite light on informational value. \nBut “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including cybersecurity reports, legal briefings, and the college essay, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least. \nRelatedly, tech words have been big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”   \n"

    "body": "\nRIP to Facebook Messenger’s desktop app. The native app for Mac and Windows is no longer available to users as of today, December 15, 2025, and existing users are being directed to the Facebook website to continue using the popular messaging service.\nThough originally launched at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Messenger’s desktop app couldn’t handle as many video call participants as business-focused rivals like Zoom, didn’t offer screensharing, or easy-to-share URLs.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for the app’s declining importance to Meta, even before the company announced its shutdown plans this October.\nIn 2023, Facebook began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app. \nMore recently, the company shifted the technology underpinning the app’s desktop version. According to Meta’s help documentation, Messenger for Mac was built with Catalyst, which lets developers bring iPad apps to the Mac. That technology has received criticism for both developers and users — developers cited the extra work required, while users noticed apps’ lack of a native feel.\nBefore its Catalyst version, the Mac app was an Electron app that later migrated to a React Native Desktop app, according to a former Meta software engineer. \nOn Windows, the app transitioned to a progressive web app last year.\nThe downgrades likely impacted user demand for a standalone Mac app, while the strategy of moving Messenger back to Facebook suggested Meta was attempting to shore up declining usage of its aging flagship social network. \nThis fall, the company warned users that Messenger’s desktop app would be deprecated by year end, and encouraged users to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web.\nPeople who use Messenger without a Facebook account are being redirected to Messenger.com after the shutdown, where they’ll be able to log in without creating a Facebook account.\nMore information for users about the transition is available on Facebook’s help center, with separate sections for Mac users and Windows users.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, Netflix recently announced its plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for $82.7 billion. Responses from the industry have been generally negative, sparking concern about the acquisition’s implications for jobs, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. \nNetflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have sought to address fears surrounding the deal in a letter to employees, which was made public by Bloomberg on Monday. \nThe executives reassured staff of their commitment to maintaining theatrical releases for WBD films. They also asserted that there will be “no overlap or studio closures.” \nThe co-CEOs further stated that the “deal is about growth” and that the company is “strengthening one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.”\nDespite these assurances, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has emerged as a vocal opponent of the acquisition, arguing that it violates antitrust laws designed to prevent monopolies. \nAdditionally, the deal has attracted the attention of lawmakers. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal submitted a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division expressing their concerns about the potential implications of a massive merger in the entertainment industry. \nThe senators argue that, in addition to raising ethical questions, the newly merged media giant would possess “more market power than the current companies to raise consumers’ television costs,” especially at a time when middle-class families are already facing rising prices. Notably, Netflix raised its subscription prices last January.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo counter monopoly concerns, Peters and Sarandos cited Nielsen data in their letter reportedly showing that combining Netflix and WBD would result in a smaller viewership share than YouTube currently holds, or what a competing Paramount-WBD merger would create.\nThe letter comes on the heels of Paramount making a competing $108.4 billion offer to acquire WBD, signaling that the competition for media dominance is far from over. Paramount was previously viewed as the main contender; however, CNBC reported that WBD’s board rejected the terms of the offer.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSnapchat announced on Monday that its end-of-year Recaps are rolling out to users, giving them a look back at 2025. The Recap is a short video that offers a personalized look at highlights from Snaps, Stories, and Chats, showing how users connected and expressed themselves throughout the year.\nUsers can access their Recap by opening the app and navigating to the “Memories” section. There, they will see a “Your 2025 Snap Recap” card.\nThe move comes as companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Duolingo have all released their own end-of-year recaps.\nAlongside the Recaps, Snapchat shared statistics on how people used the social media app over the past year. For example, the company says phone calls aren’t dead, noting that users talked for nearly 1.7 billion minutes per day on average, almost 30% more than last year. Plus, users in the U.S. sent over five billion voice notes, nearly 10% more than last year.\nGroup chats still remain a popular way to connect on Snapchat, as the number of people sending messages to group chats grew by more than 5% in 2025, and some users sent more than 8,880 messages to their top group chat this year.\nThe company also revealed that Chat Reactions grew by 44% this year, with the heart emoji taking the crown as the most popular. Additionally, three million more people also used stickers to communicate this year.\nThe launch of Snap’s 2025 Recap arrives amid user backlash over the company’s plans to charge for storage next year, with some calling for a boycott to urge the company to change its mind. Snapchat announced in September that free access to Memories will be limited to 5GB.

Launched initially about a year and a half ago, this tool aimed to help users monitor their personal information on the dark web\nFor some users, the dark web report seemed like a valuable tool, scanning various data breach dumps and alerting them if their personal information — such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers —was found in compromised databases. \nHowever, as noted on its support page, Google has decided to shut down the feature due to feedback suggesting that it “didn’t provide helpful next steps” for users facing potential identity risks.\nMany users echoed this, with Reddit discussions reflecting a common frustration: the tool didn’t offer actionable advice. As one commenter put it, it often felt like all users could do was change their passwords without clear guidance on which accounts or websites were affected.\n“We’re making this change to instead focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online,” the tech giant wrote. “We’ll continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools that help protect you and your personal information.”\nIn place of the dark web report feature, Google recommended other protective measures. The company offers other tools, such as “Security Checkup,” which reviews your Google account’s security; a built-in “Password Manager” for generating unique passwords; and “Password Checkup,” which sends alerts when your saved passwords have been compromised, among other features. \n9to5Google was the first to spot the feature’s planned shutdown, noting that users were alerted via email.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you were using the dark web report feature, it’s important to note that scanning for new dark web breaches will stop on January 16.

    "body": "\nFintech startup Mesa has shut down its Homeowners Card, which awarded points to cardholders for paying their mortgages.\nA message on the Mesa website states that as of December 12, “all Mesa Homeowners Card accounts are closed,” adding, “All credit cards have been deactivated and you are no longer able to make any new purchases or earn Mesa Points.”\nA Mesa FAQ about the shutdown described this as “a business decision to close the Mesa Homeowners Card Program entirely.” TechCrunch has reached out to Mesa for additional comment on its future plans.\nThe startup launched just over a year ago, in November 2024, with $9.2 million in funding ($7.2 million in equity funding and $2 million in debt). It offered two products — mortgage loans with 1% cash back, as well as the credit card with rewards including cash back, travel, and offset mortgage payments.\nAt the time, CEO Kelley Halpin told TechCrunch that the startup had “taken what everybody loves about travel and dining cards to re-contextualize that for the homeowner/parent.”\nIn theory, you could earn points for home expenses by using any credit card with rewards, but Mesa said it structured its points program to incentivize spending related to home ownership.\n“So it’s not rewarding you on travel and dining spend; it’s rewarding you on gas, groceries, your HOA, utilities, home goods as well as your mortgage payment,” Halpin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBilt, which has a rewards card that allows customers to earn points on rent payments, says it will expand with points for mortgage payments when it launches a revamped card next year.\nMesa’s card shutdown has been covered by travel deals websites like One Mile at a Time and Upgraded Points, which say that Mesa cardmembers have been complaining about declined transactions for the past week, with the company initially claiming this was only a temporary outage.\nNow, it seems the only remaining way to redeem points earned on the Mesa card is through a statement credit at a rate of 0.6%.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nIn a world that’s rapidly filling up with AI-generated content, a startup called First Voyage wants to help people avoid all the AI slop blasted their way and instead build the habits they want. And it’s doing that by way of an AI companion app: Called Momo Self Care, the app offers a digital pet called Momo that you can take care of, and in return, it’ll remind you to complete habit-building tasks.\nUsers can set up reminders for what tasks they want to complete, and Momo will remind you of them. Similar to the hit productivity app Focus Friend, Momo also rewards you with coins for completing tasks that can be used to purchase items within the app to further customize the pet. Users can also talk to Momo about self-care, and the AI companion will recommend habits and tasks based on what you want to achieve.\n“Momo helps users become the best versions of themselves, and users reward Momo with care, affection, and cute accessories,” co-founder and CEO Besart Çopa told TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLidar company Luminar has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after months of layoffs, executive departures, and a legal fight with its largest customer, Volvo. \nThe company aims to sell off its lidar business during the bankruptcy proceeding, and has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed.\n“After a comprehensive review of our alternatives, the board determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward,” Paul Ricci, Luminar’s CEO said in a statement. “As we navigate this process, our top priority is to continue delivering the same quality, reliability and service our customers have come to expect from us.”\nThe bankruptcy case, filed in the Southern District of Texas on Monday morning, comes at the end of a tumultuous year for a company that was valued at more than $3 billion when it went public in a reverse merger in 2020. \nLuminar founder Austin Russell abruptly resigned from the CEO role in May following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry,” though he remained on the company’s board. In October, he launched a new effort called Russell AI Labs and made a bid to buy Luminar outright. (It’s unclear if Russell plans to pursue the lidar assets in the bankruptcy case; representatives for the former CEO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) \nThe company, meanwhile, cut 25% of its workforce — its second layoff of the year. Luminar’s chief financial officer left the company, the company defaulted on a number of loans, and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation. \nLuminar was also hit with an eviction lawsuit in October at one office and it exited a lease on another in November.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother big blow came in November when Volvo, an early backer of Luminar and its largest customer heading into this year, canceled a five-year-old contract with the lidar-maker. Luminar said it has taken legal action against Volvo over the dissolution, but it has also been hit with its own legal claim from the contract manufacturer that actually made the lidar sensors. \nLuminar is claiming to have between $100 million and $500 million in assets and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities, according to the bankruptcy filings. Among those liabilities is a $10 million debt owed to Scale AI, which was helping Luminar with data labeling. Luminar also owes more than $1 million to AI software company Applied Intuition.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAI lets anyone create videos, but many AI video creation tools lack support for audio. Mirelo is building AI that adds soundtracks to match the video’s action.\nEarlier this year, the Berlin-based startup released Mirelo SFX v1.5, an AI model that interprets videos to add synced sound effects (SFX). \nThis attracted attention from VCs gearing up for a generative AI revolution in games. The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\nThis new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and ElevenLabs, which is also backed by a16z.\nWhile Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch.\nThese new hires will support Mirelo’s R&D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on Fal.ai and Replicate, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use.\nAs Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index’s investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists’ rights. \nIt’s a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn’t displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos.\nAccording to Simon-Gabriel, creators can’t fully benefit from this new potential without audio. \n“George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It’s not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it’s an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”\nHe and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. \n“It’s easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted.\nThis could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo’s total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap.\nThe startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others.\nStill, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. \nFor instance, Gemini’s video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind’s Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.’ But, of course, you should add some. It’s a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWhether or not Netflix’s $82.6 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. goes through, the deal encapsulates a fraught moment for Hollywood, as the entertainment business is increasingly overshadowed by tech giants.\nOn the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec and I discussed the deal’s implications, both for Netflix and the larger Hollywood ecosystem. Kirsten noted that it’s just the latest move bringing more consolidation to the media business, and she wondered whether it’s “too big a risk” for Netflix.\nMeanwhile, I discussed a call with Netflix executives where Wall Street analysts also seemed to be struggling to wrap their heads around the deal. And then of course there’s Paramount’s competing hostile bid — whatever happens, Warner Bros.’ days as a standalone company seem to be numbered.\nYou can read an edited preview of our conversation below.\nKirsten: I remember when Netflix was just a little baby startup and I got their [DVDs] in the mail. Here they are, all grown up, bidding for a legacy company. Did that run through your head when you saw the news?\nAnthony: Certainly symbolically, it’s this moment where the upstart has eaten Hollywood. There’ve been all these articles, even before this deal, saying, “Netflix is eating Hollywood, Netflix is transforming Hollywood.” Regardless of whether or not this deal ends up going through, Netflix will have transformed Hollywood, but this seems like the biggest — both symbolically but also substantively — one of the most dramatic things that can happen. \nThen there are all these other questions about: Will Netflix get regulatory approval? Will Paramount’s hostile bid succeed?\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhat jumped out to you as you were catching up on it, Kirsten?\nKirsten: Well, the first thing was I was like, can there be any more consolidation in this market? I mean, that was the big one for me, because if memory serves, Warner Bros. already went through like this consolidation with Discovery, right? So here we are again. There’s been so much consolidation that I have lost track of all of that.\nBut the second thought was what I immediately thought, what I kicked [off our discussion] with, which is really thinking about how Netflix [has grown], and there have been these dips in the road along its way, where the headlines have been about how it’s struggling, and will it remain relevant, and how can it do that? If they’re successful in the actual deal, [it would] potentially reflect [that] they have made it.\nBut then again, they have to execute on [running] an even bigger company than ever before. And so I guess my third thought on this is: Should they be buying this? Is this what it takes for them to expand? Is it a risk for them to take on so much? Why not just stay as they are? And I don’t know if you agree with me on that one. Is it too big of a risk? \nAnthony: I can see how it makes sense for Netflix. It’s a way to take a [content] library that is already quite large, and they’ve obviously had some very successful TV shows — less so on the movie side — [but] potentially, they just become so much stronger on the content side.\n[And] they’re suddenly now involved in all these other businesses, although the question is to what extent are they going to invest in things like the theatrical business, theme parks, making TV shows for other streaming services and networks, which are all businesses that Warner Bros. is in, and Netflix says it will continue to support. But we’ll see to what extent that’s true.\nSo it seems like something that can really benefit Netflix in some ways, but, at the same time, it does seem like this is a huge risk. If you go and look at the analyst call that Netflix’s executives did after announcing the deal, you can see that the analysts are wrestling with it and wondering “Okay, I can see that this grows your business, but does it grow your business [so much that it’s] worth an $82 billion deal?”\nAnd then of course, beyond the Netflix perspective, you have everybody else in Hollywood. There are all these maybe accurately hyperbolic headlines about: Is this the end of Hollywood? Is this the end of the movie theater business? All the unions are basically saying either, “This deal should be blocked” or “We’re very, very, very worried about this deal.” The theater owners are saying that.\nAnd so I think there’s A) Is this a good deal for Netflix? And B) is this a good deal for the entertainment business? I don’t have a good answer for either, [but] I think it’s more likely to be a good deal for Netflix than it is to be a good deal for the entertainment business.\nThough again, part of what to keep in mind as people weigh those options or think about possible outcomes here, is that because of the way that Paramount has forced Warner Bros. to consider these acquisition offers, it seems unlikely that Warner Bros. is going to be able to continue as an independent company — which, if you’re not a fan of media consolidation, that is disappointing.\n\n\n\n"

    "body": "\nJust about six months after Tesla started testing its fledgling Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, the company is now letting those cars drive around the city with no safety monitor onboard.\nThe removal of the human safety monitors brings the company a critical step closer to its goal of launching a real commercial Robotaxi service, and it’s a step that’s been years in the making. \nCEO Elon Musk spent nearly a decade promising Tesla’s cars were just a software update away from being fully driverless. Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”\nThe removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla’s ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla’s small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company aggressively redacts its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nVideo of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was testing “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company’s own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla’s head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, wrote: “And so it begins!”\nTesla started offering rides in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the driver’s seat in September. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans’ counts.\nMusk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he believed this fleet would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or around 60 vehicles.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company’s advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.\nMusk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company’s robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla’s website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk’s own admission in January, will need to be upgraded.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

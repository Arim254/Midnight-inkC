    "body": "\nOver the past few weeks, the Department of Energy has been looking at canceling billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. Now the federal agency has confirmed that it’s axing $720 million worth of manufacturing awards.\nThe cuts affect companies that make battery materials, recycle lithium-ion batteries, and manufacture super-insulating windows. \nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright has been combing through contracts made during the Biden administration. The DOE claimed that the projects “missed milestones” and “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs,” spokesperson Ben Dietderich told E&E News.\nAll of the money for the grants was authorized by Congress as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021. The bulk of the money was awarded in 2023 and 2024; previously, the Trump administration had used grants awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling awards.\nThree startups are on the list, and all three were selected for grants well before the 2024 presidential election.\nAscend Elements has been refining a recycling technology that could turn manufacturing waste and end-of-life batteries into materials required to make lithium-ion batteries domestically. In October 2022, the company was awarded $316 million toward a $1 billion facility in Kentucky. \nAlready, $206 million has been disbursed to Ascend Elements, according to federal government records. The company said it was moving ahead with its plans using other sources of funding to make up for any shortfall.\nAnovion was awarded $117 million to reshore a technology to produce synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries anodes. Chinese suppliers control 75% of the supply chain for synthetic graphite and produce 97% of all synthetic graphite anodes, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The startup’s plant is slated to be built in Alabama and, to date, only $13.8 million has been disbursed, according to a federal database.\nAnother startup, LuxWall, makes windows that insulate buildings as well as solid walls, a breakthrough that  could slash energy use and reduce people’s utility bills. The DOE had awarded the company $31.7 million to build a factory on the site of an old coal plant near Detroit. The award was granted in November 2023, though only $1 million has been sent to the company, according to government records. LuxWall opened the first phase of its factory in August 2024.\nTechCrunch had previously reported on the Department of Energy’s efforts to cancel these and other contracts. \nThe grants had been intended, in part, to launch the startups over the “valley of death” that can claim many promising companies as they transition from technology development to commercial deployment. First-of-a-kind factories and facilities aren’t easy for startups to finance, and government grants like these encouraged private investors to contribute capital. Once up and running, they can serve as a template for future factories, bolstering the country’s manufacturing base.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAnthropic launched a web app on Monday for its viral AI coding assistant, Claude Code, which lets developers create and manage several AI coding agents from their browser.\nClaude Code for web is now rolling out to subscribers to Anthropic’s $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100- and $200-per-month Max plans. Pro and Max users can access Claude Code on the web by navigating to claude.ai (the same website for Anthropic’s consumer chatbot) and clicking into the “Code” tab, or through the Claude iOS app.\nThe launch marks Anthropic’s latest attempt to evolve Claude Code beyond a command-line interface (CLI) tool that developers access from a terminal. By putting Claude Code on the web, Anthropic hopes developers will spin up AI coding agents in more places.\nIt’s increasingly competitive for tech companies trying to make their AI coding tools stand out. While Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot once dominated the space, Cursor, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic now have highly performant AI coding tools of their own — many of them already available on the web. That said, Claude Code is arguably one of the most popular. Anthropic’s flagship coding tool has grown 10x in users since its broader launch in May, and the product now accounts for more than $500 million of the company’s revenue on an annualized basis.\nAnthropic product manager Cat Wu tells TechCrunch in an interview that she attributes a large part of Claude Code’s success to the company’s AI models, which have become a favorite among developers in recent years. However, Wu also says the Claude Code team deliberately tries to “sprinkle in some fun” to the product wherever they can.\nWu said that Anthropic will continue to put Claude Code in more places, but the terminal will likely remain the home base for their AI coding product.\n“As we look forward, one of our key focuses is making sure the CLI product is the most intelligent and customizable way for you to use coding agents,” said Wu. “But we’re continuing to put Claude Code everywhere, helping it meet developers wherever they are. Web and mobile are a big step in this direction.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnthropic claims that 90% of the Claude Code product itself is written by the company’s AI models. Wu, who was previously an engineer, says that she rarely ever sits down at a keyboard to write code anymore, and mostly just reviews Claude Code’s outputs. \nEarly AI coding tools worked like an autocomplete tool, finishing lines of code as developers wrote them. But the agentic generation of AI coding tools — including Claude Code — allow developers to spin up agents that work autonomously. This shift has made millions of software engineers act more like managers of AI coding assistants in their day-to-day jobs.\nThe change has not been welcome to every developer. One recent study found that some engineers were actually slower when using AI coding tools like Cursor. Researchers suggested one factor could be that engineers in the study spent much of their time prompting and waiting for AI tools to finish, rather than working on other problems. AI coding tools also struggle in large, complex code bases, so engineers may have spent a lot of time working through incorrect responses from the AI model.\nNevertheless, companies like Anthropic are continuing to push ahead making AI coding agents. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted a few months ago that AI should soon write 90% of code for software engineers. While that may be true inside of Anthropic, the shift may taken longer to pan out in the broader economy.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "\nA Waymo robotaxi was recently spotted driving around a school bus that had its red lights flashing, and federal safety regulators have opened an investigation as a result.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced Monday morning that its Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an investigation after seeing footage from early October of a Waymo autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus that was unloading kids in Atlanta, Georgia.\nODI says in a document that it will investigate the performance of Waymo’s self-driving software around stopped school buses, how the system is designed to comply with rules related to the buses, and more. The NHTSA said Monday that, based on its engagement with Waymo so far, the “likelihood of other prior similar incidents is high.”\nThe Waymo robotaxi in question crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. According to Waymo, the bus was partially blocking the driveway that the robotaxi was leaving. The company claims the robotaxi could not see the flashing lights or stop sign. Waymo did not immediately respond to a question about whether the vehicle could see the students getting off the bus, or the bus’s control arm.\n“Safety is our top priority, as we provide hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous paid trips every week in some of the most challenging driving environments in the U.S.,” the company said in a statement, while citing data that shows its vehicles get in fewer crashes than human-driven ones. “NHTSA plays a vital role in road safety, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the agency as part of our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver.”\nWaymo also said Monday that it has already issued software updates to its fleet to improve performance.\nThis has been a year of expansion for Waymo. The company launched in Atlanta, brought its robotaxis to Austin, expanded across Silicon Valley, and is testing in a number of other metro areas, including New York City. It’s also testing at the San Jose and San Francisco airports, and has many more cities lined up for 2026.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPart of the process of launching in new cities is having the self-driving system encounter and learn from new scenarios — although it’s safe to say Atlanta was not the first place that Waymo’s robotaxis have seen school buses.\nThis is not the first time the NHTSA has opened an investigation into Waymo’s self-driving cars. In 2023, the NHTSA probed reports that Waymo’s vehicles were struggling with roadway barriers like gates and chains in low-speed situations. That investigation ultimately led to a recall back in May, which Waymo addressed with a software update. Last year, the agency announced a probe centered on reports that Waymo vehicles had driven into the wrong lane or entered construction zones.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a plus-one ticket.\n\nDaniel Lurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the city’s economy and restoring its global standing, isn’t just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech’s impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.\nBy showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn’t retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It’s doubling down.\nFor TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn’t mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city’s rebound, he’ll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco’s best inventions haven’t been built yet.\nJust 7 days left to save on your pass and catch Mayor Lurie live\nIf you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won’t want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their plus-one ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group.

    "body": "\nOura announced on Monday that it’s launching a new redesigned app experience and a “Cumulative Stress” feature. The company also shared that it’s pursuing FDA clearance for blood pressure features that give users a likelihood assessment of hypertension. \nThe redesigned Oura app introduces more personalization with three main tabs. The “Today” tab surfaces the most relevant insights for daily decisions, and the “Vitals” tab provides at-a-glance views of things like sleep, stress, and cardiovascular trends. The “My Health” tab offers insights into the user’s long-term well-being, highlighting strengths, trends, and opportunities for proactive care. The tab also includes “Habits” and “Routines” sections to show the impact of daily actions.\nThe app redesign also brings enhanced menstrual cycle insights, including a 12-month view of period and fertile window predictions, up from the previous one-month view. \nImage Credits:Oura\nThe new Cumulative Stress feature helps users understand how their bodies accumulate and respond to chronic stress over time. It provides a stress measurement based on the past month of data and is updated weekly. A person’s Cumulative Stress is determined by five factors: sleep continuity, heart stress-response, sleep micro-motions, temperature regulation, and activity impact.\n“It’s much more than just tallying the hours spent in stressful periods,” Oura VP of Consumer Software Product, Jason Russell, told TechCrunch. “It’s actually measuring different bodily functions indicative of cumulative stress taking a toll on your body. So things like how your heart rate and heart rate variability respond after a period of stress is indicative of cumulative stress. Your thermodynamics. How you regulate temperature overnight, how continuous your sleep is. Whether you experience what we call sleep, micro-motions, so not just big movements during sleep, but twitches. There are little signatures that would be indicative of your body experiencing high cumulative stress.”\nThe new feature will roll out globally in the coming weeks.\nOn the road to developing an FDA-approved blood pressure feature, Oura announced that it’s introducing a new Blood Pressure Profile study to explore how the company can identify early signs of hypertension by passively tracking key signals in the background.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Oura\nOura received approval from the Institutional Review Board for the study, which is launching in experimental hub Oura Labs in the U.S. later this year. Users who are part of the study will be notified of their current likelihood of hypertension by combining Oura Ring data with a short check-in questionnaire on family history, medication, and lifestyle habits. They will receive an assessment that lets them know if they have no signs, moderate signs, or major signs of hypertension.\nMembers with strong signs will be encouraged to seek professional medical care. The algorithm will also track changes over time, prompting periodic reviews throughout the study, Oura says. \nMonday’s announcement comes a week after Oura raised $900 million in fresh funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation from new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.\nIt also comes as Oura recently launched its Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection, its first-ever charging case, and a new Health Panels feature that lets members schedule blood work directly in the Oura app. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nX is launching a marketplace for inactive handles that will allow Premium subscribers to request and purchase usernames. The marketplace will offer both free and paid options for requesting or acquiring eligible handles. Rare handles could be priced at anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, X says. \n“Priority” handles refers to usernames that often include full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations. These handles are free to request for Premium+ and Premium Business subscribers. If a user’s request is approved, X will transfer the handle to them for free. However, if a user cancels or downgrades their subscription, their old handle will return to their account after a 30-day grace period.\nX notes that examples of “Priority” handles include usernames like @GabrielJones, @PizzaEater, and @ParadoxAI.\nThe launch of the new marketplace will allow X to boost revenue through direct payments. It will also potentially increase interest in its Premium subscription offering, as it continues to deal with a struggling ads business.\nThe social network says not all requests are approved and that requests are usually reviewed within three business days. Once a request is approved, the user’s old handle is reserved and won’t be given to anyone else.\n“Rare” handles include short, generic, or culturally significant names. These handles won’t be available through standard requests and will instead be offered through public drops and direct, pre-priced purchases available by invitation only. \nFor public drops, multiple people can apply for the handle. X says selection is based on a user’s past contributions on the platform, their intended use of the handle, and their engagement and reach on the social network. \nAs for direct purchases, pricing is based on a number of factors, such as popularity of the word, character length, and cultural significance. Once purchased, the user gets to keep the handle even if their Premium subscription ends.\nExamples of “Rare” handles include usernames like @Pizza, @Tom, and @One.\nX explained on a help page that it’s launching the marketplace instead of releasing inactive handles at once for anyone to claim because it wants to prevent bot spam or misuse, noting that the marketplace “allows for fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”\nIf a user has a specific inactive handle in mind that isn’t on the marketplace, they can “Register” their interest to add the handle to their Watchlist. It it becomes available, X will notify them. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

These Firefly models were launched in 2023 and have been trained entirely on licensed data. Adobe’s Foundry service then fine-tunes these models for each customer using their intellectual property.\nThe Foundry service pricing is based on usage, as opposed to by seat like many of Adobe’s other products.\nHannah Elsakr, a vice president of generative AI new business ventures at Adobe, told TechCrunch the Foundry service was a natural expansion of the company’s enterprise AI products — and customers were asking for more customization.\n“This is elevating a lot of the capabilities we already had,” Elsakr said. “The enterprise has asked us to come in and advise us, help us, partner with us, be our premier creative marketing AI partner on this.”\nSince Adobe released its Firefly models in 2023, enterprises have used them to create more than 25 billion assets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nElsakr said these custom models will help brands be able to better keep up with their advertising campaigns. A customer could create an ad campaign for a product once and use a custom Adobe model to help generate the same ad for different seasons, languages, or formats.\n“It’s highly personalized,” Elsakr said. “We’ve been talking about personalized commerce for so long, but generative AI and Firefly make it possible to put the brand in the hand of the consumer in an on-brand way.”\nDespite the capabilities of the new tools, Esakr said Adobe is not trying to replace human creatives by any means and rather just give them better versions of the tools they were already using to create their content.\n“Our stance is humanity is at the center of creativity and that can’t be replaced,” Elsakr said. “We have been for decades in the business of providing creative tooling that helps uplift narrative, tell storytelling, your ability to envision and execute your creative vision. Firefly and Foundry are just the next evolution of giving you tools in the toolkit that elevate your ability to tell a story.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "description": "Apple is responding to user feedback on its new Liquid Glass design with a setting that lets users choose between Clear and Tinted appearances. Introduced in iOS 26.1 beta 4, the option gives users more control over interface opacity after complaints that Liquid Glass made some elements harder to read.",
    "body": "\nApple has rolled out a new feature that makes it easier to customize Liquid Glass to your liking. Now users will be able to set the appearance of Liquid Glass to either Clear or Tinted, with the help of a new setting included in the latest beta update of its mobile and desktop operating systems.\nThe addition indicates Apple is listening closely to user feedback in these early days of the iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 public launches. Apples likes to push through more significant changes, but it will often offer a fallback option for those who have a hard time adjusting.\nThat was the case when Apple moved Safari’s address to the bottom of the screen in 2021. After some user backlash over the then controversial decision, the iPhone maker added an option to revert the bar to the top of the screen. (Apple, we’ll concede, was right to make the move; the bar’s location is better when it’s in easier reach of your thumbs.)\nNow Apple is taking a similar approach with Liquid Glass.\nThe new user interface that shipped with iOS 26 and other Apple operating systems was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move from a skeuomorphic to flat design back in 2013. As with most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome have said the Liquid Glass design makes various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps like Apple Music and others. Others have said they love Liquid Glass’s attention to detail and its new look, which felt like a more modern update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nWith another potential divisive response on its hands, Apple is now ceding some control over Liquid Glass’s appearance back to the users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThe new feature, first spotted by 9to5Mac, arrived in iOS 26.1 beta 4 and the accompanying updates for tablets and desktop computers.\nReached for comment, Apple told TechCrunch that, during the beta period this summer, it heard from some users who wanted the option to set a more opaque look for Liquid Glass. This new setting that lets users personalize Liquid Glass is available in iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS 26.1.\nTo access the feature, beta users can visit the “Display & Brightness” menu under Settings to find the added Liquid Glass menu option. On Mac, it’s under “Appearance” in System Settings. The control lets you choose between two options, Clear and Tinted. The latter increases the opacity of interface elements, making them easier to see. \n\nThough some users had been advocating for a slider that lets them control the opacity more precisely, Apple has opted for a toggle where it specifies the two levels of tint that users can choose from. \nApple told TechCrunch that any developers who have already implemented Liquid Glass in their apps will automatically have the user’s preference applied. Developers are able to test this now in the 26.1 developer beta.\nAfter selecting their preferred option, users will see changes across user interface elements, like the Now Playing controls, Notifications on the Lock Screen, and in Apple’s apps and those from third-party developers. \nWhile the beta feature arrives for developers today, the public beta should arrive over the next few days ahead of the wider public release. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nNew data indicates that use of Meta AI’s mobile app for iOS and Android has seen a significant increase. According to a new analysis from market intelligence provider Similarweb, the app’s daily active users across both platforms jumped to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from around 775,000 just four weeks ago. In addition, Meta AI’s app installs are also up, reaching 300,000 new downloads per day, compared with under 200,000 daily downloads a few weeks ago.\nFor comparison, Meta AI’s app had just 4,000 daily downloads a year ago, on October 17, 2024. \nImage Credits:Similarweb\nThe firm says it hasn’t seen any meaningful correlation in either search or advertising estimates, but notes Meta could be running Facebook or Instagram promotions that wouldn’t be captured in its model.\nHowever, there’s also another possible explanation for the sharp rise: the launch of Meta’s new Vibes feed in September, which introduced short-form AI-generated videos to the Meta AI mobile app. \nMeta AI introduced the Vibes feed on September 25, which correlates with the sharp increase in the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android, as seen in the chart below. \nImage Credits:Similarweb\nRecently, OpenAI’s video generator Sora drew headlines as its app reached the top of the App Store when users rushed to try the new technology. However, Meta AI could have benefited from this launch as well. While Similarweb says its data doesn’t prove cause and effect, it’s possible that the attention to Sora drove some people to try Meta AI, in order to compare the two experiences.\nAnother possibility is that Meta could be benefiting from Sora’s invite-only status. That is, those who couldn’t try out the OpenAI app may have looked for an alternative to experiment with. This would be an interesting explanation, too, as it suggests that OpenAI’s decision to gatekeep Sora may have directly boosted its rivals.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nAs of October 17, Meta AI’s app had seen a 15.58% increase in daily active users worldwide, while ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity saw declines of 3.51%, 7.35%, and 2.29%, respectively. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn a region long defined by fragmented enterprise systems, outdated compliance tools, and HR software that rarely talks to finance, Cercli is building a unified alternative for MENA businesses with AI at its core.\nThe Dubai-based startup, founded by ex-Careem operators Akeed Azmi and David Reche, has announced an oversubscribed $12 million Series A round led by European VC Picus Capital.\nCercli today looks slightly different from the company that raised a $4 million seed round last year. It is rebuilding a Rippling-like stack for the MENA region, but making it AI-native from the ground up.\nOver the past year, that bet has paid off. The company says it has scaled revenue more than 10x and now processes over $100 million in payroll annually for multiple businesses across 50 countries.\nBut in a crowded HR-tech market—where dozens of startups such as Deel and Remote, alongside incumbents like SAP and Oracle, already promise everything from cross-border payments to payroll — why does the market need another HR tech player? CEO Azmi hopes its AI-first rebuild may be the edge that sets it apart.\nAzmi started Cercli to help enterprises with basic people operations, an issue he and Reche noticed at their previous employers, Careem and Kitopi, two of MENA’s best-known unicorns.\nWith payroll spread across multiple systems and compliance varying by region, the first version of Cercli focused on a platform that consolidated human resources management, payroll, and compliance for MENA-based companies operating globally.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Azmi says it envisioned a bigger opportunity if it baked in AI. So, over the past three months, Azmi says the company has rewritten its entire payroll engine to be multi-country and agent-compatible, enabling it to scale more efficiently across global jurisdictions.\n“The legacy systems of the last 20 years—your SAPs, Oracles, Workdays—they were built for on-prem and the cloud. Now we’re entering an AI-native world,” Azmi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We didn’t want to just integrate AI; we wanted to rethink the whole stack for how people and agents work together.”\nIt’s also done the same to its recruitment module. Cercli now offers agent-driven features that can surface candidate lists, source from internal datasets, and run background logic on hiring fit.\nIt’s own internal operations run on AI, as the company uses custom-built treasury and reconciliation agents to manage its own finances and accounting. That’s how the 14-person team closed its Series A while maintaining a 21% month-to-month revenue growth rate, according to Azmi.\nCercliImage Credits:Cercli\nBeyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.\n“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.\nAzmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.\nCercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.\nOther investors who participated in this Series A round include Knollwood Investment Advisory as well as existing investors Y Combinator, Afore Capital, and COTU Ventures.\nAs part of the investment, the company plans to build new AI-native products and work on gaining more market share in the $5.8 billion HR software opportunity in MENA.\n“We’ve seen this business model succeed globally within our portfolio, and we are excited to back Cercli as they continue to grow market share through new customers and product launches,” said Robin Godenrath, founding partner at Picus Capital.\n"

Though plans to migrate Tumblr to WordPress infrastructure are on hold, Mullenweg said he hasn’t given up.",
    "body": "\nWordPress co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg called the company’s Tumblr acquisition his biggest failure — but one he hasn’t given up on yet. The comments were made at the recent WordCamp Canada 2025 conference, where Mullenweg went live for a Town Hall session to connect with the open source-focused WordPress community.\nThe exec noted that Tumblr was still on a different technical stack than WordPress — something he had intended to correct by migrating the back end to WordPress infrastructure. However, that massive undertaking was put on hold earlier this year, as the cost to move Tumblr’s half-billion blogs would be difficult given that the blogging platform wasn’t profitable and continues to be sustained by the profits of other Automattic products.\nThe company has tried to trim costs with layoffs and the reallocation of Tumblr resources to more profitable parts of the business, but those efforts have yet to pay off. \nMullenweg acknowledged these concerns at his Town Hall session, saying, “I need to switch [Tumblr] over to WordPress, but it’s a big lift. It’s over 500 million blogs, actually, and, as a business, it’s costing so much more to run than it generates in revenue.”\nAs a result, Automattic had to prioritize other projects to make Tumblr sustainable, he said.\n“It’s probably my biggest failure or missed opportunity right now, but we’re still working on it,” he added. \nIf Tumblr were to move to the WordPress back end, it would be simpler and more cost-effective to maintain. Plus, it would enable the service to further join the open social web known as the fediverse, which was to be one perk of the WordPress migration.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDuring the course of his talk, Mullenweg discussed the other projects underway at the company, including at WordPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. He mentioned Playground, which lets you run WordPress entirely in a web browser, and Automattic’s universal messaging app Beeper. The latter will be expanding to include support for bridges to other messaging apps, like KakaoTalk and messaging services from dating apps, he said.\nHe also touched on AI, saying, “We’re not putting the genie back in the bottle” with the technology, and calling companies like OpenAI “too big to fail.” In one area of the business, the WordPress theme directory, he’s thinking of tagging images made with AI to allow people to filter their searches appropriately, rather than rejecting AI-generated themes.\nNotably, Mullenweg answered a question about the legal drama with WP Engine, a WordPress hosting company that Automattic has called out for profiting from the open source ecosystem without giving back. In response to an audience question about bad actors who exploit the community, Mullenweg responded that he didn’t “want to say that there’s bad actors,” but rather “bad actions.”\nHe suggested that Automattic should create more incentive systems to encourage contributions and other good behavior, like giving certain people higher rankings in the WordPress directory or showcase. He also encouraged the community to “vote with your wallet” by not supporting businesses that aren’t doing the right thing.\n“There’s a site called WordPressEngineTracker.com which is currently tracking a number of sites that have left a certain host. It’s about to cross 100,000 … that have switched to other hosts, and there were 74,000 have gone offline since September of last year,” he said.\nThe court ordered the site taken down at one point, which Mullenweg told the crowd was them “trying to muzzle free speech and transparency.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "One post, authored by Khan’s staff, was published on January 3, 2025, with the title “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm.” It noted that the FTC was “taking note of AI’s potential for real-world instances of harm — from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.” ",
    "body": "\nThe Federal Trade Commission has removed three blog posts from the Lina Khan era that addressed open source AI and risks of AI to consumers, according to a Wired report.  \nOne post, titled “On Open-Weights Foundation Models,” was published July 10, 2024. Another, titled “Consumers Are Voicing Concerns About AI,” came out in October 2023. A third, authored by Khan’s staff, was published on January 3, 2025, with the title “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm.” That post noted the FTC was “taking note of AI’s potential for real-world instances of harm — from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.” \nTechCrunch has reached out to the FTC to learn why the posts were taken down. Khan declined to comment.  \nThese removals are part of a broader pattern under the Trump administration, which began issuing executive orders to direct federal agencies to remove or modify substantial amounts of government content.\nAfter his inauguration, Trump also installed a new head of the FTC and removed several FTC commissioners, installing leadership that focused less on Khan’s aggressive antitrust agenda and more on deregulation for Big Tech. In September, new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson submitted recommendations for deleting or revising anticompetitive regulations across the entire federal government.\nThe blog posts most recently removed by the FTC, which focused on consumer harm, don’t seem to align with the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan. That plan has reduced its focus on safety and guardrails, instead favoring fast growth and competition with China. However, the Trump administration has been vocal about backing open source initiatives.  \nFormer FTC public affairs director Douglas Farrar told TechCrunch: “I was shocked to see that Andrew Ferguson led FTC be so out of line with the Trump White House on this signal to the market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis is not the first time this administration’s FTC has removed content. In March, Wired reported that the FTC removed around 300 posts related to AI, consumer protection, and the agency’s lawsuits against tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft.  \nWhile hundreds of blog posts from Khan’s tenure and earlier remain on the agency’s Office of Technology Blog, Ferguson’s FTC has yet to publish any posts to the site, despite the feverish pace of the AI race, which has resulted in several business mergers and acquisitions — including acqui-hires — that could be seen as anticompetitive.\nThe FTC blog culling follows the Trump administration’s removal or modification of thousands of government web pages and datasets, particularly content related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; gender identity; public health; and environmental policy. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has removed data on topics ranging from chronic medical conditions to HIV/AIDS. The Justice Department has removed studies on hate crimes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has taken down the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports.  \nThe removal of content — including the blog posts from the FTC — could violate the Federal Records Act, which requires federal agencies to preserve records that properly document government activities, and the Open Government Data Act, which requires agencies to publish their data as “open data” by default. \nThe Biden administration’s FTC leadership placed warning labels on content published during previous administrations that it disagreed with, according to Wired. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nCards Against Humanity, the irreverent party game company known for its provocative humor, has settled its trespassing lawsuit against SpaceX, one year after filing the complaint and launching a profanity-laced marketing campaign against Elon Musk’s rocket company.\nThe dispute centered on a plot of land along the Rio Grande in Cameron County, Texas, that Cards Against Humanity purchased in 2017. The company crowdfunded the purchase through 150,000 separate $15 donations ($2.25 million total) from supporters who wanted to help block President Donald Trump’s border wall.\nThe land happened to be located right next to where SpaceX has been building its Starbase rocket complex, a launch facility for the company’s spacecraft. That became an issue in 2024 when Cards Against Humanity accused SpaceX of trespassing on the property and dumping construction equipment and materials there. (SpaceX and a lawyer for the rocket company did not respond to a request for comment.)\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed. Cards Against Humanity had been seeking $15 million and had told supporters who helped fund the land that it hoped to pay them as much as $100 each from the proceeds. But those supporters won’t receive cash; instead, they can sign up for a “brand new mini-pack of exclusive cards all about Elon Musk,” a special expansion for the popular party game, according to an email they’ve just received.\n“So while we can’t give you what you really wanted—cash money from Elon Musk—we’re going to make it up to you, our best, sexiest customers … with comedy!” the company wrote in the email sent on Monday, referring to the new mini-pack of cards.\n“We’re happy to have stood up to a bully like Musk. We’re happy to have forced a settlement,” Cards Against Humanity told TechCrunch in a statement. The company says SpaceX has removed its construction equipment and that Cards Against Humanity is “working to restore [the land] to its natural state: devoid of space garbage and pointless border walls.” \nIn an email to its supporters last year, Cards Against Humanity had told them: “Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire — Elon Musk — snuck up on us from behind and completely f—-d your land with gravel, tractors, and space garbage.” It even launched a website titled “www.ElonOwesYou100Dollars.com.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCards Against Humanity said at the time that its “longstanding reputation as a company that makes outrageous promises and actually keeps them is on the line.” But it also warned those supporters in the email that “Musk has way more money and lawyers than we do, so you’ll probably get, like, $2 tops.” \nNow they won’t even get that amount.\nThe lawsuit had moved quickly. The two sides had already gone through the discovery process, where both parties exchange evidence before trial, and a trial was slated for November. Cards Against Humanity told TechCrunch on Monday that SpaceX even admitted to the trespass during discovery, which the gaming company called “a real vindication.”\nCards Against Humanity said Monday that it was “prepared to go to trial and we’re confident we would have won.” But the company ultimately decided that a trial “would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.” \n“Under Texas law, we likely wouldn’t be able to recoup our legal fees. We had the truth on our side, but Musk and SpaceX could easily outspend us,” the company said.\nMusk is well known for his willingness to fight his perceived enemies — and those of his companies — in court. He once claimed that Tesla’s “hardcore litigation department” would “never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.”\nDespite that, Musk and his companies often settle. The Cards Against Humanity case is not the first this year. Earlier this month, X settled a complaint filed by former Twitter executives. Tesla has settled a number of Autopilot-related cases. One Autopilot case that Tesla didn’t settle — despite having the chance to do so — became one of its highest-profile court losses to date.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

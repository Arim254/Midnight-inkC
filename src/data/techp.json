Luminar started the year with around 580 employees, but the company did not specify the size of the layoff earlier this year. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe company also announced its chief financial officer, Thomas Fennimore, is stepping down on November 13 “to pursue other career opportunities.” Luminar said Fennimore’s departure is “not the result of any disagreement” about its finances or with the company’s auditors.\nThis all comes as founder Austin Russell — who was replaced as CEO in May following an unspecified ethics inquiry by the board of directors’ audit committee — is in the middle of trying to buy the company. That buyout was encouraged by at least some of the board members, as TechCrunch previously reported.\nLuminar has struggled in part because it has sold fewer lidar sensors to Volvo, which was supposed to be a major customer. In August, Fennimore said Luminar was therefore selling the sensors at a lower cost than it takes to build them. \nLuminar said Friday that it has $72 million of cash and marketable securities as of October 24. Without any additional fundraising, the current burn rate means Luminar could run out of money as early as the first quarter of next year, or breach the terms of certain loan agreements. \nOn Friday, Luminar revealed it had already skipped required quarterly interest payments on certain loans that were due October 15. Those lenders have agreed to give Luminar until November 6 to make the payments before taking any action.\nLuminar is not due to report its third-quarter financial results for another two weeks, but on Friday, it revealed it expects to report around $18 million of revenue and debt of $429 million.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSocial network Bluesky, which on Friday announced a new milestone of 40 million users, will soon start testing “dislikes” as a way to improve personalization on its main Discover feed and others. \nThe news was shared alongside a host of other conversation control updates and changes, which include smaller tweaks to replies, improved detection of toxic comments, and other ways to prioritize more relevant conversations to the individual user.\nWith the “dislikes” beta rolling out soon, Bluesky will take into account the new signal to improve user personalization. As users “dislike” posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked feeds, but also reply rankings.\nThe company explained the changes are designed to make Bluesky a place for more “fun, genuine, and respectful exchanges” — an edict that follows a month of unrest on the platform as some users again criticized the platform over its moderation decisions. While Bluesky is designed as a decentralized network where users run their own moderation, some subset of Bluesky users want the platform itself to ban bad actors and controversial figures instead of leaving it up to the users to block them.\nBluesky, however, wants to focus more on the tools it provides users to control their own experience. \nToday, this includes things like moderation lists that let users quickly block a group of people they don’t want to interact with, content filter controls, muted words, and the ability to subscribe to other moderation service providers. Bluesky also lets users detach quote posts to limit unwanted attention, which has long influenced the toxic culture of “dunking” on X (formerly Twitter).\nIn addition to dislikes, the company says it’s testing a mix of ranking updates, design changes, and other feedback tools to improve the conversations on its network.\nThis includes a new system that will map out the “social neighborhoods” on Bluesky, meaning the connections between people who often interact and reply to one another. Bluesky says it’s prioritizing replies from people “closer to your neighborhood,” to make conversations you’re shown in your feed more relevant and familiar. The new “dislikes” may have some influence here, as well, Bluesky says. \nThis, in particular, is an area where competitor Threads, from Meta, has been challenged at times. \nAs newsletter writer Max Read noted last year, Threads tended to land its users in a confusing feed where conversations they weren’t connected to would appear, sometimes in mid-story. Read remarked that “it’s often impossible to figure out who is replying to whom and where and why you’re seeing certain posts. They appear from nowhere and lead to nowhere,” he wrote at the time.\nBluesky’s plan to map out social neighborhoods could address this issue as it scales.\nThe company also said its latest model does a better job at detecting replies that are “toxic, spammy, off-topic, or posted in bad faith,” and downranks these in threads, search results, and notifications. \nAnother change to the Reply button will now take users to the full thread instead of straight into the compose screen, which may encourage users to read the thread before responding. \nThis, says Bluesky, is a simple way to “reduce content collapse and redundant replies” — another criticism that tends to be levied at Twitter/X.\nPlus, the company is tweaking the reply settings feature to make it more visible to users that they can control who is allowed to respond to their posts.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAI search startup Perplexity has signed a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images, which gives it  permission to display images from Getty across its AI-powered search and discovery tools. The deal marks a notable shift for the company, which has been hit by allegations of content scraping and plagiarism, and signals an effort to establish more formal content partnerships. \nPerplexity and Getty have been working together for more than a year, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. Though it was never announced, Getty was part of Perplexity’s Publishers’ Program, a plan to share ad revenue with publishers when their content surfaced in a search query, the source said.  \nToday’s agreement is a new deal. A source told TechCrunch it’s not a traditional lump sum licensing deal, since Perplexity doesn’t train its own foundational models, but would not elaborate on the terms. \nPerplexity’s agreement with Getty appears to legitimize some of the startup’s previous use of Getty’s stock photos. Perplexity has come under fire within the last year for a series of plagiarism accusations from several news organizations. In one case, the startup was called out for pulling content from a Wall Street Journal article, including the Getty photo in that piece.  \nAt the time, several outlets questioned whether Perplexity’s use of the images constituted copyright infringement. A source last year told TechCrunch that Perplexity was working on an agreement with Getty, but we were unable to confirm the deal after reaching out to the stock image giant several times.  \nMore recently, Reddit sued Perplexity in October, alleging “industrial-scale, unlawful” scraping of user content and circumventing technical measures to access data. Reddit has a data licensing agreement with OpenAI. \nPerplexity says its Getty deal will help it better display images and include credits with links back to the original source whenever images show up in search results. \nNick Unsworth, vice president of strategic development at Getty, said the agreement “acknowledges the importance of properly attributed consent and its value in enhancing AI-powered products.” \n“Attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand the world in an age of AI,” Jessica Chan, head of content and publisher partnerships at Perplexity, said in a statement. “Together, we’re helping people discover answers through powerful visual storytelling while ensuring they always know where that content comes from and who created it.” \nPerplexity’s emphasis on attribution is part of its strategy of defending against copyright accusations by arguing its use of publisher content — including content behind a paywall or that publishers have explicitly indicated they don’t want scraped — constitutes “fair use” because publicly available facts are not copyrightable.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nMeta signed three deals this week to procure nearly 1 gigawatt of solar power as it races to power its lofty AI ambitions.\nThe trio of agreements brings Meta’s total solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts of capacity this year. Solar is cheap and quick to build, and as a result, it has become a go-to power source for tech companies as their data center fleets multiply in size.\nMeta yesterday announced two agreements in Louisiana that see it buying the environmental attributes of a combined 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are expected to be completed two years from now.\nThey follow on the heels of a larger deal announced Monday in which Meta bought 600 megawatts from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas. The project will also start commercial operations in 2027.\nWhile the Texas power plant won’t connect directly to Meta data centers, it will feed into the local grid, offsetting use by the facilities.\nThe Louisiana deals, though, involve purchasing of certificates that allow Meta to offset its carbon-intensive sources of power. \nSuch environmental attribute certificates (EACs), sometimes called renewable energy certificates, have been criticized by experts for obscuring the true carbon footprint of tech companies’ operations, which have ballooned as AI has driven up electricity use.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEACs were introduced years ago when renewables were costly relative to fossil fuel generators. They let anyone buy the electricity, but also gave companies an option to pay extra to offset their own emissions — and offset the higher costs of renewable power. They helped encourage developers to build more renewable projects.\nBut the cost of new solar and wind has dropped dramatically since then, with renewables undercutting new fossil power and sometimes existing coal and natural gas power plants. EACs don’t provide the same incentive as before, and experts question how much additional renewable power they stimulate. \nIf companies truly want to offset their new energy use from AI, they should be encouraging developers to build new renewable capacity, experts argue.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCore Scientific shareholders on Thursday voted down an all-stock acquisition offer from partner and competitor CoreWeave that was valued at the time at $9 billion.  \nThey did so following a vote-no recommendation from their largest shareholder, Sina Toussi of Two Seas Capital, a firm that focuses on post-bankruptcy companies. Core Scientific emerged from its bankruptcy in January 2024.  \nCore Scientific, which began as a crypto miner and still is one, shares that early history with AI data center provider CoreWeave, which also started as a miner.  \nBut CoreWeave, with investor and partner Nvidia, has now transitioned to serving AI workloads. From its IPO until now, its stock has soared from a $14 billion market cap to $66 billion today (about $140 per share) as investors view it as a way to get in on the AI action. It has been spending those shares on acquisitions.  \nCoreWeave had already signed a $10 billion, 12-year contract with Core Scientific to use its facilities for AI services, even as it nailed down a deal announced in July to buy the company outright. The offer was a premium to Core Scientific’s share price at the time.\nBut investor Toussi thinks Core Scientific can turn into another CoreWeave on its own.  “Since the transaction was announced in July, investment in AI infrastructure has accelerated, driving equity valuations of Core Scientific’s peers to ever-greater heights,” he wrote in his opposition letter. “Why would anyone vote for a transaction worth a mere $16.40 per share?” \nSo investors turned down the deal and CoreWeave walked. Core Scientific’s stock rose on the news, and the company is now trading at a $6.6 billion market cap. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestors turning down acquisition bids in pursuit of bigger offers is another sign that we’re in – or at least headed for – an AI bubble. \nMeanwhile, CoreWeave is still shopping. On Thursday, it turned around and acquired Marimo, an open-source Jupyter Notebook competitor, for an undisclosed sum. PitchBook estimates Marimo has raised about $5 million.\nPython notebooks are dev tools that combine code, rich media, and explanatory text into a single, shareable file. They’re often used for interactive data analysis as well as AI app development, helping CoreWeave as it attempts to move up the stack from hosting to AI app building.\n"

    "body": "\nU.S. telecommunications giant Ribbon has confirmed that government-backed hackers had access to its network for almost a year before getting caught, according to a public filing.\nThe telco giant said in a 10-Q disclosure last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that a suspected “nation-state actor had gained access to the company’s IT network” as early as December 2024. Ribbon said it notified law enforcement and that it believes the hackers are no longer in its network.\nThe Texas-headquartered Ribbon provides phone, networking, and internet services for companies, enterprises, and critical infrastructure organizations, such as energy and transportation systems. The company counts hundreds of companies as customers, including Fortune 500 firms and government agencies, such as the Department of Defense.\nReuters first reported news of the breach. \nCatherine Berthier, a spokesperson for Ribbon, confirmed that three of Ribbon’s customers are known to be affected but declined to name the affected companies, citing confidentiality.\nIt’s not clear if the hackers exfiltrated personally identifiable information belonging to any individuals or other sensitive data from its corporate customers in the breach, but the company noted in the filing that “several customer files saved outside of the main network on two laptops do appear to have been accessed by the threat actor.” Ribbon said it notified the affected customers.\nRibbon is the latest in a series of telecommunication providers to have been hacked over the past two years but did not immediately attribute the hack to a particular government, when asked by TechCrunch.\nBerthier declined to provide additional information when asked by TechCrunch, citing the company’s ongoing investigation.\nChinese-backed hackers have previously targeted and compromised at least 200 U.S.-based companies, including phone and internet providers, in an effort to steal phone records and calling data about senior U.S. government officials. Several telcos, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, were confirmed hacked as part of the campaign, along with cloud giants and datacenter providers. \nSome of the companies were located outside of the United States, including in Canada.\nThe hackers, known as Salt Typhoon, are one of several China-backed hacking groups said to be targeting the U.S. and its allies as part of a multi-year effort to prepare for a future anticipated Chinese invasion of Taiwan, according to U.S. government officials.\nUpdated with comment from Ribbon.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

(Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, I have received the message three times thus far to my personal email.)\nPenn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch in an email on Friday that the school’s incident response team is “actively addressing” the situation.\n“A fraudulent email has been circulated that appears to come from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. This is obviously a fake, and nothing in the highly offensive, hurtful message reflects the mission or actions of Penn or of Penn GSE,” Ozio said.\nAs the hackers plainly stated in their message (“Please stop giving us money”), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. The breach also comes soon after the university publicly rebuffed the White House’s offer to make commitments aligned with the Trump administration’s political agenda in exchange for federal funding. Penn and six other schools have rejected the White House’s proposal.\nThe White House’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” asks universities to abolish affirmative action in hiring and admissions, and to discipline departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” \nCompact signatories would also be required to freeze tuition for five years, offer tuition-free education to students pursuing “hard sciences,” cap international undergrad enrollment at 15%, and require standardized tests like the SAT for admission. \nThe compact also mandates that schools enforce policies that marginalize transgender and gender non-conforming students.\n“[The compact] preferences and mandates protections for the communication of conservative thought alone,” wrote Penn president J. Larry Jameson in his response to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, which was published on the university’s website.\n“One-sided conditions conflict with the viewpoint diversity and freedom of expression that are central to how universities contribute to democracy and to society,” wrote Jameson.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is on track to record its strongest year of growth in three years, fueled by the AI industry’s unprecedented demand for computing power.\nAWS is growing 20% year-over-year and ended the third quarter with $33.1 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, Amazon announced in its third-quarter earnings release on Thursday. The business segment’s operating income increased to $11.4 billion in Q3, up from $10.4 billion at the same point in 2024.\n“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY,” Andy Jassy, the president and CEO of Amazon, said in the company’s earnings announcement. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\nAWS launched an infrastructure region in New Zealand during the quarter and has three more regions in the pipeline.\nThe cloud infrastructure provider also secured several new deals in Q3 across a variety of industries, including a few notable names in the AI market. In July, AWS partnered with Perplexity to launch the AI browser company’s enterprise product. AWS also partnered with Cursor during the third quarter.\nThe intense infrastructure demands of AI have also been a boon to AWS’s competitors. OpenAI and Oracle allegedly inked a massive $300 billion cloud compute deal in September that will start in 2027. The pair also made a deal for OpenAI to pay Oracle $30 billion a year for data center services. Last week, Google and Anthropic announced a cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars.\nThese huge deals come despite skepticism of how much cloud infrastructure will actually be needed in the future and if the industry is heading into bubble territory. However, it does makes sense for cloud companies like AWS to take advantage of a market where customers are willing to pay big sums for their services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“You’re going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing capacity because we see the demand,” Jassy said about investing in AI infrastructure. “As fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\nThis news comes two days after Amazon announced it was slashing 14,000 corporate jobs, as it looks to invest more in its AI strategy.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Zach Gibson / Stringer / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:34 AM PDT · October 31, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman said AI chatbots aren’t a major traffic driver for the social platform despite companies like OpenAI and Google having seen progress in people using AI for search. During Reddit’s Q3 2025 call, the exec noted that Google search and direct access continue to be its top traffic drivers. \n“[Chatbots are] not a traffic driver today. I think our relationships with the companies that we work for — or work with directly are healthy, and we both learned a lot over the last couple of years, really the value of Reddit’s data and where our respective products can go and how we can help each other. So I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners. But they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Huffman said during the call with analysts.\nAn analyst asked the company if 50% of the traffic comes from Google and 50% direct. Huffman said that those numbers are “approximate, but pretty close.”\nReddit has had a tricky relationship with LLM builders. The company locked down its data through a new policy change in May 2024 and indicated that any kind of commercial use of its data would need a license. At the same time, the company signed a deal with OpenAI to let it use Reddit data for model training.\nThe company also has a partnership agreement with Google. On the other hand, it has started a legal battle with AI companies like Anthropic and Perplexity.\nReddit reported a positive quarter with $585 million in revenue, up 68% year-on-year. The company also clocked in 116 million daily active unique users and 444 million weekly active unique users, with 20% growth year-over-year. The company mentioned it recorded 31% year-on-year growth in international daily users. It also said that more than 190 million Americans visit the social network every week.\nThe company mentioned that it continues to invest in making the search experience a central part of the experience. Huffman said that the company is handling 20% of search volumes through its AI-powered Answers and “that kind of core search box.” He noted that in Q3, 75 million people searched weekly on Reddit. The company has been talking about unifying AI and the core search experience, and Huffman said it is coming in the next few quarters.\nWhat’s more, Reddit is experimenting with a new and simpler onboarding flow to increase early user engagement.\n“We want them to see in their first session that Reddit is amazing and has content for them. So our goal is to connect users with relevant content very quickly,” Huffman said.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple CEO Tim Cook signaled to investors the company is still open to acquisitions and partnerships to move things forward on the AI front. \nThe comments were made this week during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. The exec also offered a brief update about Apple’s next-generation, AI-powered Siri, saying the service was still on track to launch in 2026.\n“We’re making good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it next year,” Cook said during his opening remarks. \nOne analyst on the call also asked Cook if Apple was still pursuing a three-pronged approach when it came to the development of its personalized AI — meaning a combination of in-house Apple foundation models, partnerships with third-party LLM providers, and acquisitions. \nCook responded that Apple was still open to the latter, noting the company continually surveils the market on M&A and  is “open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will advance our roadmap.”\nIn a pre-earnings interview with CNBC, Cook noted that Apple was preparing to announce more AI partnerships like the one it has with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,” Cook told the outlet.\nOn the earnings call, Cook also talked about how Apple creates foundation models, ships them on devices, and uses them in Private Cloud Compute, its cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing.\nCook shared later in the call that Apple is already using its Private Cloud Compute technology for a number of Siri queries and is continuing to build out that infrastructure.\n“In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we’ve got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. And, you know, it’s robust,” he said. \nCook additionally suggested that AI was a factor in consumers’ decision-making process when it comes to selecting a new smartphone. \n“I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor,” he said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday morning at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, our senior producer Maggie Nye rolled up her jacket sleeve to show me her new tattoo: a classic, pixelated cursor arrow. TechCrunch’s Becca Szkutak got a matching cursor, while Theresa Loconsolo got a smiling moon.\nI guessed that at some point during all the Disrupt hoopla, Maggie and Becca wandered off to some trendy San Francisco tattoo shop to cement their friendship with appropriately tech-themed ink (and maybe Theresa was there too?). That seemed like a more logical explanation than the reality, which is that they got these tattoos at Disrupt — yes, literally at Disrupt, on the Moscone Center’s convention floor, while upstairs, there was probably a talk going on about product-market fit or agentic AI.\nHundreds of startups showed their stuff in the Expo Hall as part of the Battlefield 200 — there’s robo chefs, spacecraft insurance providers, a shortcut for recycling plastic — and then amid the chaos, Tattd turned their booth into a mini tattoo shop.\nMaggie’s tattoo.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nTattd is a platform that helps tattoo seekers find artists whose portfolios match the kind of tattoo they’re looking for. \nThe startup uses generative AI to create a mockup of a design, but these synthetic designs aren’t actually getting inked on anyone’s body. Rather, Tattd puts the AI-generated design through a reverse image search to find an artist whose work resembles the mock-up, so that the client and artist can work together to create an original design, as one normally would when they get connected with a tattoo artist.\n“If you go to ChatGPT and say something like, ‘I want to see a butterfly in a Japanese traditional style with heavier lines,’ they don’t know what that means,” founder Laura Schaack told TechCrunch.\nJust feet away, TechCrunch deputy managing editor Karyne Levy was getting an escape key tattooed on her upper arm.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKaryne’s tattoo.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nBefore founding Tattd, Schaack led operations for two startups: WearAway, a fashion rental company acquired by Grin, and Lemonsqueeze, a market expansion platform acquired by Knotel. But Schaack has always had an eye for the arts. She studied art history at New York University, and her body is decorated with a collage of tattoos — at Disrupt, she got a California postage stamp by her elbow.\n“There is a number of people that have tried to enter the tattoo industry without tattoos, and they have all failed,” Schaack said. While you can’t judge a founder by their appearance, she says that their lack of tattoos reflected their lack of interest, investment, or experience in the industry.\n“I’m so deeply passionate about this industry, I’m heavily tattooed, and I’m here to support artists to build businesses in a way that both the client and the artist are taken care of,” she said. There are 900 artists on Tattd, and the platform partners with a third party to help them find healthcare and financial advisers.\nTattd’s flash sheet.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nSchaack said that around 30 people got tattoos throughout the three days of TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThere was a TechCrunch logo on the flash sheet, but (un)fortunately, no one inked their love for our brand on their body.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAdam, one of the most viral startups in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch, has raised a $4.1 million seed round to power its next steps, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\nAfter generating over 10 million social media impressions with the launch of its text-to-3D model app, the AI startup had its pick of investors. \n“We were getting term sheets over email without any meetings,” said CEO Zach Dive (on the right in the picture above).\nAdam quickly went with TQ Ventures as its lead investor because they agreed on the future of computer-aided design (CAD). Just as importantly, they also agreed on Adam’s roadmap — going consumer first, and then to enterprise.\nThis required the most alignment: Adam caught people’s attention with a mainstream product, not an enterprise one. But Dive said this choice is paying off and paving the way for Adam’s upcoming copilot for professional-grade CAD workflows.\nThe startup had always planned to go B2B but felt that the technology wasn’t enterprise-ready yet — which is why it initially focused on makers, not engineers. But AI models improved faster than they expected, and Adam now plans to launch its copilot by the end of the year, Dive said.\nIts initial tool lets creators without CAD skills create 3D models from text prompts, but early feedback showed that text wasn’t always the best way to interact with 3D, Dive said. “So for our copilot, we blended in different interaction paradigms; for example, users selecting different parts of the 3D object and conversing with it.” \nThis will give the startup an element of differentiation compared to other text-to-CAD products, although there is already competition in the “AI copilot for CAD” segment as well. MecAgent, for instance, is already available, but Adam could capitalize on its viral launch.\nEarly momentum particularly helped with hiring, which is still an ongoing effort, Dive said. He and his co-founder, Adam CPO Aaron Li, both graduated from UC Berkeley’s Master of Design program, but the startup also needs more AI and engineering talent to “give models the right context for reasoning in space.”\nCapital and endorsements can both help with this endeavor, and Adam now has its fair share of both, sometimes combined. Besides TQ and participating funds 468 Capital, Pioneer, Script Capital, and Transpose Platform, Adam is also backed by angel investors, including Tim Glaser (PostHog), Trevor Blackwell (YC), and Theo Browne (T3 Chat).\nIn addition, Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch called Adam “the v0 of CAD” (in a nod to Vercel’s V0, an AI-powered platform for web creation).\n“It’s simpler, faster, and reaches a broader audience,” he wrote on X.\nAdam is already on its way to reaching a broad audience, with “tens of thousands of individual users and a growing base of paying customers” for its standard and pro plans, which respectively start at $5.99 and $17.99 per month. The startup hasn’t begun to monetize its soon-to-launch enterprise offering, but has “testers validating different features,” Dive said.\nThis testing phase is clearly necessary: There’s quite a jump from helping amateurs print 3D Pikachus to supporting engineers in their daily work. Dive said the startup doesn’t intend to replace them, but instead streamlines time-consuming tasks such as applying the same change to multiple CAD files.\nWith an initial focus on mechanical engineering, the startup plans to help these pro users generate feature‑rich parametric designs in popular CAD programs, beginning with Onshape, which is known for bringing CAD to the cloud and reshaping workflows. “The same thing will be true with AI,” Dive predicted.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nNavan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company.\nThe company was the first to use a new SEC rule that allows public listings during a government shutdown.\nUnlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval.\nBut the updated mechanism carries a risk: The government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation.\nDespite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1.\nThe stock’s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty.\nThe market’s reaction to Navan’s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they’re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNavan has been waiting to go public for several years. The company reportedly filed its confidential IPO paperwork in 2022 and planned to debut at a $12 billion valuation in early 2023.  \nThe company, formerly known as TripActions, was last valued at $9.2 billion when it raised a $154 million Series G round in October 2022.\nNavan customers include Shopify, Zoom, Wayfair, OpenAI, and Thomson Reuters. The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan’s expense management solution helps companies manage employee expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization.\nThe company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to its S1.\nNavan’s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCreative suite company Canva launched its own design model on Thursday that understands design layers and formats to power its features. The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets.\nCanva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.\n“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call. \n“What we’ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.”\nEarlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs.\nUsers can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design.\nThe company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it’s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCanva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta.\nAlong with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms.\nThe company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand’s aesthetics.\nCanva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users.\nCanva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It’s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

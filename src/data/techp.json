The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that “none of [OpenAI’s] best people” took the offers.\n“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in the memo to staff.\nThis line of thinking tracks with Meta’s recent “year of efficiency” — a more sanitized way to describe the company’s mass layoffs. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that “leaner is better.”\nNow, it seems that Meta isn’t lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts. The company claims that most of these people impacted today should be able to find another job within Meta. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nSnapchat is making its new “Imagine Lens,” the company’s first open prompt image-generation AI Lens, available to all users for free. The Lens was initially launched in September but only for paid subscribers. With the Lens, users can edit their own Snaps using custom prompts or generate their own.\nFor instance, you could prompt the app, “Turn me into an alien” after snapping a selfie, or request an image of a “grumpy cat.” The company suggests you could use the Lens to try on Halloween costume ideas, or reimagine your friend in a new look, among other things.\nThe results can be shared with friends, posted to your Story on Snapchat, or shared beyond the app. \nThe broadened availability of the AI Lens follows the launch of AI video-generating apps from Meta (Meta AI) and OpenAI (Sora), which compete for young people’s attention with even more advanced AI tools and features than photo modifications. \nFor instance, Sora lets users generate videos of themselves after providing the app with a one-time video and audio recording to capture their appearance. Friends can share these AI personas, dubbed “cameos,” with one another, so they can star in videos together.\nThat puts pressure on other social apps like Snapchat to keep up, so making the AI image Lens free to use seems a worthwhile investment for the app maker. \nUntil now, Snapchat’s AI Lens was only available to Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum Subscribers, the company says. With the expanded rollout, Snap is making a limited number of image generations available to all free users, as well. At launch, free users in the U.S. will be able to access the new Lens, with plans for other markets underway, starting with Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Lens is found near the front of the in-app Lens Carousel, or you can search for it by name.

The family first filed a wrongful death suit against OpenAI in August after alleging their son had taken his own life following conversations with the chatbot about his mental health and suicidal ideation. ",
    "body": "\nOpenAI reportedly asked the Raine family — whose 16-year-old son Adam Raine died by suicide after prolonged conversations with ChatGPT — for a full list of attendees from the teenager’s memorial, signaling that the AI firm may try to subpoena friends and family.  \nOpenAI also requested “all documents relating to memorial services or events in the honor of the decedent, including but not limited to any videos or photographs taken, or eulogies given,” per a document obtained by the Financial Times. \nSpeaking to the FT, lawyers from the Raine family described the request as “intentional harassment.” \nThe new information comes as the Raine family updated its lawsuit against OpenAI on Wednesday. The family first filed a wrongful death suit against OpenAI in August after alleging their son had taken his own life following conversations with the chatbot about his mental health and suicidal ideation. The updated lawsuit claims that OpenAI rushed GPT-4o’s May 2024 release by cutting safety testing due to competitive pressure.\nThe suit also claims that in February 2025, OpenAI weakened protections by removing suicide prevention from its “disallowed content” list, instead only advising the AI to “take care in risky situations.” The family argued that after this change, Adam’s ChatGPT usage surged from dozens of daily chats, with 1.6% containing self-harm content in January, to 300 daily chats in April, the month he died, with 17% containing such content. \nIn a response to the amended lawsuit, OpenAI said: “Teen wellbeing is a top priority for us — minors deserve strong protections, especially in sensitive moments. We have safeguards in place today, such as [directing to] crisis hotlines, rerouting sensitive conversations to safer models, nudging for breaks during long sessions, and we’re continuing to strengthen them.” \nOpenAI recently began rolling out a new safety routing system and parental controls on ChatGPT. The routing system pushes more emotionally sensitive conversations to OpenAI’s newer model, GPT-5, which doesn’t have the same sycophantic tendencies as GPT-4o. And the parental controls allow parents to receive safety alerts in limited situations where the teen is potentially in danger of self-harm. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and the Raine family attorney.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nCloud monitoring and security platform Datadog has solved an age-old joke: What’s up, dog?\nDatadog’s answer is not, “Not much, you?” Rather, the company launched a web dashboard that shows developers the status of dozens of services and tools like AWS, Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Slack — essentially letting them check whether major software providers are functioning properly. The tool is free, so anyone can check Updog to find out if major SaaS providers are up … dog.\nDatadog clearly had fun with this branding, as they should. Rhys Sullivan, a software engineer, said in an X post in June, “you’re telling me that datadog has an uptime monitoring product and they didn’t call it ‘updog’?”\nFour months later, Datadog engineer Tim Brown replied, “Here you go,” and linked to the newly launched Updog.\n\nSullivan’s initial tweet was actually referring to the branding of a tool within the paid Datadog platform, which provides more in-depth monitoring tools, whereas Updog, which is free, is for more general use. Anyone can check the status of popular online services without needing a Datadog subscription.\nJokes aside, Updog seems like it will be a useful free tool for developers — and it probably would’ve come in handy on Monday, when a day-long AWS outage took a great portion of the web offline, including some banks, payment processors, and government services.\nDatadog says that its Updog dashboard is set apart by its use of AI, which can identify subtle patterns in telemetry — the transmission and collection of remote data from servers and services — that can surface potential outages more quickly. If Updog can successfully pull this off, that foreknowledge can make a difference for businesses that depend on SaaS tools for everything from collecting payments to accessing cloud-stored data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Updog.ai recently surfaced an Amazon DynamoDB degradation 32 minutes before AWS updated its own status page,” Datadog wrote in a blog post.\nWhile a company may not always be able to avoid major collapses like this week’s AWS outage, knowing about service issues early can at least give companies extra time to assess their situation, and that’s what’s Updog. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The idea behind the glasses is to give delivery drivers a hands-free experience that reduces the need to keep looking between their phone, the package they’re delivering, and their surroundings.\nThe e-commerce giant says the glasses will allow delivery drivers to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery, all without using their phones. The glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision alongside cameras to create a display that includes things like hazards and delivery tasks. \nAmazon likely hopes that the new glasses will shave time off of each delivery by providing delivery drivers with detailed directions and information about hazards directly in their line of sight.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nWhen a driver parks at a delivery location, Amazon says the glasses automatically activate. The glasses help the driver locate the package inside the vehicle and then navigate to the delivery address. The glasses can provide easy-to-follow directions in places like multi-unit apartment complexes and business locations.  \nThe glasses are paired with a controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery, and a dedicated emergency button. \nAmazon notes that the glasses also support prescription lenses and transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe retailer is currently trialing the glasses with delivery drivers in North America and plans to refine the technology before a wider rollout.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported last year that Amazon was working on the smart glasses. \nIn the future, Amazon says the glasses will be able to provide drivers with “real-time defect detection” that could notify them if they accidentally drop off a package at the wrong address. The glasses will also be able to detect pets in yards and automatically adjust to hazards like low light conditions.\nAlso on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled a new robotic arm called “Blue Jay” that can work alongside warehouse employees to pick items off shelves and sort them.

    "body": "\nControversial dating safety apps, Tea and TeaOnHer, have been pulled from the Apple App Store. The apps’ removal was first spotted by the app store intelligence provider Appfigures, which told TechCrunch the two apps were removed from the App Store on Tuesday in all markets but remain live on Google Play.\nReached for comment, Apple confirmed the apps’ removal, saying it removed Tea Dating Advice and TeaOnHer from the App Store because they failed to meet Apple’s requirements around content moderation and user privacy. The company also said it saw an excessive number of user complaints and negative reviews, which included complaints of minors’ personal information being posted in these apps.\nApple communicated the issues to the developers of the apps, a representative said, but the complaints were not addressed. (Request for comment from the app developers has not yet been returned.)\nSpecifically, Apple cited violations of its App Review Guidelines 1.2, 5.1.2, and 5.6. Rule 1.2 says apps with user-generated content should offer reporting and blocking features and should remove objectionable content. Rule 5.1.2 says apps can’t use or share someone’s personal information without permission, and Rule 5.6 says excessive customer reports and negative reviews violate Apple’s Developer Code of Conduct.\nTea and TeaOnHer have generated a lot of headlines and interest since going viral earlier this year. Tea, which had quietly existed since 2023 before picking up steam in 2025, was pitched as a dating safety tool for women, somewhat similar to the “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” Facebook Groups. The app encouraged women to spill details about men, particularly those on dating apps. This included their personal information, Yelp-style reviews, and whether they’d dub them a “green flag” or “red flag.”\nMany men, however, didn’t appreciate the app’s invasion into their privacy and questioned whether sharing information like this could be considered defamation.\nAfter going viral and generating controversy, Tea suffered a data breach over the summer, with hackers gaining access to 72,000 images, including 3,000 selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts, comments, and direct messages.\nLater, a rival app called TeaOnHer launched to offer men the ability to dish on women in the same way, but it was beset by security issues that exposed users’ personal information, including government IDs and selfies, TechCrunch discovered in August.\nAppfigures says the Tea app saw 6.1 million total lifetime downloads and had generated $5 million in gross revenue to date. TeaOnHer had 2.2 million downloads and didn’t offer in-app purchases. It notes the apps remain live on Google Play for now. \nWith their App Store removal, however, copycats are gaining traction. For instance, an app called TeaOnHer and Him – Overheard has 354,000 total downloads and has jumped from No. 90 on the Overall Top App Charts to No. 27.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nDating app giant Tinder announced on Wednesday that it’s expanding its facial-verification feature to more users in the U.S. \nThe facial-verification feature, known as Face Check, requires new users to verify their identity by submitting a short video selfie. This initiative aims to reduce impersonation on the platform and ensure that people are not connected to bots or fake accounts.\nFace Check creates a 3D video scan of the user’s face to verify its similarity with their profile pictures. Members who successfully complete the verification process earn a badge on their profiles, indicating to others that they have been verified. Additionally, the feature identifies whether the same face is utilized across different accounts, providing an additional safeguard against impersonation and fraudulent profiles.\nTinder says that the video selfies are deleted shortly after review but that it keeps a “non-reversible, encrypted face map and face vector,” which help verify new photos, spot fraud, and stop people from making duplicate accounts. \nImage Credits:Tinder\nThe Face Check feature has already been in place in California since June, as well as in Colombia and Canada. It’s also now available in Australia, India, and other countries across Southeast Asia. \nFace Check will roll out to additional U.S. states in the coming months. It will also roll out to other dating apps owned by parent company Match Group in 2026.\nUsers have been leaving the Tinder app in recent years because of issues related to safety and privacy, along with unfavorable encounters with other users.

    "description": "Instagram introduced custom app icons for its teen accounts, but not everyone is thrilled. In replies to the company’s post on X, users criticized the feature for being age-gated, arguing that adults like personalization, too.",
    "body": "\nSome Instagram users are feeling cheated out of a new feature, as the photo and video sharing app on Wednesday announced the launch of custom icons — but only for its teen users. \nTeens can now choose from a set of custom icons that turn the traditional Instagram logo into new variations that can be used as the app’s icon on their phone’s home screen. The option is accessed by tapping the Instagram logo at the top of the home feed after opening the app.\nCurrently, the custom icons include six renditions of the Instagram logo styled as neon, clear glass, fire, flowers, green slime, and more.\n\nAn update just for Teen Accounts: now you can change your Instagram app icon to match your aesthetic 🌟To change the icon, press the Instagram logo at the top of the home feed after opening the app 💗 pic.twitter.com/XZbZzOQ2DR— Instagram (@instagram) October 21, 2025\n\nIn the replies to its announcement on X, users are overwhelmingly pushing back against the idea that such a feature should be age-gated, noting that adult users also want to customize their home screens. Some accused Instagram of chasing Snapchat with the feature. (On Snapchat, users need a paid Snapchat+ subscription to change the app’s icon.) Others said it gave them “MySpace vibes.”\nInstagram’s teen accounts, launched in 2024, add additional restrictions and built-in protections for minors, including limits on content to PG-13 material. The company, earlier this year, began using AI technology to identify teens who lied about their age on the social network and enroll them in the more restricted teen accounts.\nWith custom icons, the company is trying a different approach: using a carrot instead of a stick, so to speak, to make the teen accounts seem more appealing. Reached for comment, Instagram told TechCrunch it added the icons because it found teens love to customize their Instagram experience.

    "body": "\nAI labs are racing to build data centers as large as Manhattan, each costing billions of dollars and consuming as much energy as a small city. The effort is driven by a deep belief in “scaling” — the idea that adding more computing power to existing AI training methods will eventually yield superintelligent systems capable of performing all kinds of tasks.\nBut a growing chorus of AI researchers say the scaling of large language models may be reaching its limits, and that other breakthroughs may be needed to improve AI performance.\nThat’s the bet Sara Hooker, Cohere’s former VP of AI Research and a Google Brain alumna, is taking with her new startup, Adaption Labs. She co-founded the company with fellow Cohere and Google veteran Sudip Roy, and it’s built on the idea that scaling LLMs has become an inefficient way to squeeze more performance out of AI models. Hooker, who left Cohere in August, quietly announced the startup this month to start recruiting more broadly.\n\nI'm starting a new project.Working on what I consider to be the most important problem: building thinking machines that adapt and continuously learn. We have incredibly talent dense founding team + are hiring for engineering, ops, design. Join us: https://t.co/eKlfWAfuRy— Sara Hooker (@sarahookr) October 7, 2025\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Hooker says Adaption Labs is building AI systems that can continuously adapt and learn from their real-world experiences, and do so extremely efficiently. She declined to share details about the methods behind this approach or whether the company relies on LLMs or another architecture.\n“There is a turning point now where it’s very clear that the formula of just scaling these models — scaling-pilled approaches, which are attractive but extremely boring — hasn’t produced intelligence that is able to navigate or interact with the world,” said Hooker.\nAdapting is the “heart of learning,” according to Hooker. For example, stub your toe when you walk past your dining room table, and you’ll learn to step more carefully around it next time. AI labs have tried to capture this idea through reinforcement learning (RL), which allows AI models to learn from their mistakes in controlled settings. However, today’s RL methods don’t help AI models in production — meaning systems already being used by customers — to learn from their mistakes in real time. They just keep stubbing their toe.\nSome AI labs offer consulting services to help enterprises fine-tune their AI models to their custom needs, but it comes at a price. OpenAI reportedly requires customers to spend upward of $10 million with the company to offer its consulting services on fine-tuning.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We have a handful of frontier labs that determine this set of AI models that are served the same way to everyone, and they’re very expensive to adapt,” said Hooker. “And actually, I think that doesn’t need to be true anymore, and AI systems can very efficiently learn from an environment. Proving that will completely change the dynamics of who gets to control and shape AI, and really, who these models serve at the end of the day.”\nAdaption Labs is the latest sign that the industry’s faith in scaling LLMs is wavering. A recent paper from MIT researchers found that the world’s largest AI models may soon show diminishing returns. The vibes in San Francisco seem to be shifting, too. The AI world’s favorite podcaster, Dwarkesh Patel, recently hosted some unusually skeptical conversations with famous AI researchers.\nRichard Sutton, a Turing award winner regarded as “the father of RL,” told Patel in September that LLMs can’t truly scale because they don’t learn from real-world experience. This month, early OpenAI employee Andrej Karpathy told Patel he had reservations about the long-term potential of RL to improve AI models.\nThese types of fears aren’t unprecedented. In late 2024, some AI researchers raised concerns that scaling AI models through pretraining — in which AI models learn patterns from heaps of datasets — was hitting diminishing returns. Until then, pretraining had been the secret sauce for OpenAI and Google to improve their models.\nThose pretraining scaling concerns are now showing up in the data, but the AI industry has found other ways to improve models. In 2025, breakthroughs around AI reasoning models, which take additional time and computational resources to work through problems before answering, have pushed the capabilities of AI models even further.\nAI labs seem convinced that scaling up RL and AI reasoning models are the new frontier. OpenAI researchers previously told TechCrunch that they developed their first AI reasoning model, o1, because they thought it would scale up well. Meta and Periodic Labs researchers recently released a paper exploring how RL could scale performance further — a study that reportedly cost more than $4 million, underscoring how expensive current approaches remain.\nAdaption Labs, by contrast, aims to find the next breakthrough and prove that learning from experience can be far cheaper. The startup was in talks to raise a $20 million to $40 million seed round earlier this fall, according to three investors who reviewed its pitch decks. They say the round has since closed, though the final amount is unclear. Hooker declined to comment.\n“We’re set up to be very ambitious,” said Hooker, when asked about her investors.\nHooker previously led Cohere Labs, where she trained small AI models for enterprise use cases. Compact AI systems now routinely outperform their larger counterparts on coding, math, and reasoning benchmarks — a trend Hooker wants to continue pushing on.\nShe also built a reputation for broadening access to AI research globally, hiring research talent from underrepresented regions such as Africa. While Adaption Labs will open a San Francisco office soon, Hooker says she plans to hire worldwide.\nIf Hooker and Adaption Labs are right about the limitations of scaling, the implications could be huge. Billions have already been invested in scaling LLMs, with the assumption that bigger models will lead to general intelligence. But it’s possible that true adaptive learning could prove not only more powerful — but far more efficient.\nMarina Temkin contributed reporting.\n"

    "body": "\nTesla’s record sales quarter has offered the company a reprieve after a terrible start to 2025. But CEO Elon Musk is focused on building a “robot army” and making good on his years-long, unfulfilled promise of self-driving cars — tasks he needs to accomplish if he is to unlock the full value of the $1 trillion compensation package that Tesla wants to award him.\nThe tension between Tesla’s current automotive-driven business and the AI-centric one that Musk is aiming for has never been more clear.\nTesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, thanks in large part to a rush of customers in the United States who took advantage of the expiring federal EV tax credit. But that record quarter did not lead to greater earnings. In fact, Tesla’s third-quarter profit was still 37% lower than it was in the same quarter last year.\nTesla shipped 497,099 cars in the third quarter, which generated $21.2 billion in automotive revenue — the company’s best revenue figure in more than a year. But Tesla only pulled in a profit of $1.4 billion, up just $200 million from the second quarter of this year, according to a shareholder letter released Wednesday. The record quarter came after an abysmal start to the year for Tesla, which saw sales drop mightily in part because of Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration.\nThe company explained in the letter that a big increase in operating expenses — 50% higher compared to the third quarter last year — was one of the culprits. That operating expense bump was thanks to spending on AI and other R&D projects, as well as “restructuring” charges of nearly $240 million. Tesla didn’t explain what those restructuring charges were for, but it’s possibly related to the recent decision to shut down the company’s six-year-old Dojo supercomputer project.\nTesla cited tariffs as another drag on profits this past quarter, meaning Musk spent around $300 million to help elect a president who has hurt the company’s business. Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said on a conference call Wednesday the tariff hit was about $400 million.\n“We’re at a critical inflection point for Tesla and our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world,” Musk said on the call. Tesla is at the “beginning of scaling, quite massively, Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAll of this will put even more pressure on the company’s final quarter of the year.\nTesla already needs another record quarter (and then some) if it wants to simply match the number of cars it shipped in 2024 or 2023. The company could get some help from the new slightly cheaper stripped-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y EVs. But even in that best-case scenario, Tesla is way off the path of 50% year-over-year growth that it once promised to investors and shareholders.\nBut Musk has spent the last few years trying to get shareholders, investors, employees, and everyone else to look beyond the company’s core business of making and selling cars. He’s bet the future of Tesla on being able to create a vast network of self-driving vehicles that he thinks can challenge Uber. And he thinks the humanoid robot, Optimus, will become the best-selling product ever. \nTesla offered little new info on those programs in Wednesday’s letter. Musk said on the conference call that Tesla may start building the third version of Optimus in the first quarter of 2026. He had once promised to build thousands of the robots by the end of this year, but as The Information has reported, Tesla has run into problems in early production with Optimus.\n“Bringing Optimus to market is an incredibly difficult task, to be clear. It’s not like some walk in the park,” Musk said. \nBut Musk continued Tesla’s gauzy, unspecific claims about how much Optimus will change the world. “You can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care,” he said. “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon.” \nThe increased focus on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars (including starting production of the two-seater “Cybercab”) will also cost Tesla more next year. Taneja said capital expenditures will increase “substantially” in 2026 thanks to those projects. He also said Tesla has had to increase employee-related spending to stay competitive in the ongoing AI talent war.\nTesla’s third-quarter results come amid the backdrop of the company’s proposal to hand $1 trillion worth of shares to Musk. That plan is up for a vote at the Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in a few weeks. The company — and Musk — are campaigning hard. While advisor groups like ISS and Glass Lewis are recommending against the pay package, it’s most likely going to pass given the overwhelming support from shareholders on previous efforts.\nThat hasn’t stopped Musk from threatening to walk away from Tesla if the package isn’t approved.\nOn Wednesday’s call, he reiterated his claim that he cares more about the voting control the compensation package would afford him than the money. \n“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no friggin’ clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said.\nThis story has been updated with new information from Tesla’s third-quarter conference call.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nOpenAI unveiled its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, during a livestream on Tuesday. There are other AI browsers such as The Browser Company’s Dia, Opera’s Neon, Perplexity’s Comet, and General Catalyst-backed Strawberry. OpenAI’s launch is notable because of the sheer scale of reaching potentially 800 million of its weekly ChatGPT users. For the company, the browser is much more about keeping ChatGPT central than about making web browsing better.\nWhile Atlas is currently available only on the Mac, the company is already working on bringing it to Windows, iOS, and Android — all the surfaces where ChatGPT already exists. OpenAI has also made the browser available to all users instead of opting for an invite system like its rivals. The core proposition of the browser is for you to think of ChatGPT as the first interaction surface for search and answers instead of Google.\nAll the AI browsers share a similar idea about search and Q&A. Instead of performing a search query, you would type something in your address bar to get answers from an AI chatbot, instead of looking at pages of links.\nAnd OpenAI, just like other browser makers, thinks that Atlas will change the way you browse the web, as Sam Altman made clear at the launch. “We think AI represents once in a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be, how to use one, and how to most productively use the web. Tabs were great but there hasn’t been a lot of innovation since then,” Altman said in his opening speech.\nTech leaders, including Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, have talked about AI as a platform shift. However, for consumers, phones and desktop operating systems are still the primary way to get to their AI tools. OpenAI wants to own the pipes of distribution of ChatGPT as much as it can. Last week, Meta shut its doors to third-party chatbots, including ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp, which has over 3 billion monthly users. This essentially means that the platform owners could put the brakes on distribution at any point in time.\nFor OpenAI, Atlas will also present an opportunity to deeply integrate ChatGPT and other products better than other platforms can. Users can directly reference multiple websites instead of posting links to ChatGPT. The company already uses a headless browser for its agent. With Atlas, it might have more control over the feature. It has already integrated a hovering writing assistant that shows up in text fields.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nWhat’s more, the company is working on integrating its App SDK, which lets you call other apps within ChatGPT, to improve discoverability. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe memory feature is also key for ChatGPT’s power users. The feature takes into account the browsing history, along with your ChatGPT history, to provide answers with that context in mind. You can ask, “What was the work document I had my presentation plan on?” and ChatGPT will fetch that link for you. This also means that ChatGPT gets more context about you as you spend more time in the browser. OpenAI can use this context and provide it to other apps when it starts rolling out Sign in with ChatGPT widely.\nBoth features — making ChatGPT the default search option and enabling memory — are designed to gather more user data, giving OpenAI greater insight into user behavior and enabling better product development. The browser doesn’t have an ad-blocker, a VPN, a reading mode, or a translate feature to make the browsing experience better for a site. Rather, users have to ask ChatGPT to summarize content or find something on a page — as if opening a page is designed to give ChatGPT more context rather than to help users consume the content on the page.\nIn contrast, The Browser Company’s Arc has some useful ideas around revamping the browser experience, like using AI to rename downloaded files or customize a web page by letting you remove elements.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nThe result is more than a browser; it’s a broader canvas for ChatGPT itself. OpenAI’s CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, laid out this idea in her blog outlining the Atlas launch.\n“When we first released ChatGPT, we weren’t sure how people would use it. Now that we have feedback and signals from hundreds of millions of people around the world, it’s clear ChatGPT needs to become so much more than the simple chatbot it started as. Over time, we see ChatGPT evolving to become the operating system for your life: a fully connected hub that helps you manage your day and achieve your long-term goals,” Simo said.\nThe big question for OpenAI is how to make people, whose default browser is Chrome, Safari, or Edge, switch to its own browser and get some market share out of Google, Apple, and Microsoft’s hands. OpenAI is seeing steady growth in the number of people using ChatGPT. But it is not clear whether an average user would want to mix their browser and chatbot experience just yet. Chrome succeeded because it was fast, and people wanted to use Google queries as the default starting experience of the internet. ChatGPT Atlas is perfect for users who have replaced Google with ChatGPT, but to replace Chrome, OpenAI needs to make sure that billions of users fall into that habit.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Stellantis is collaborating with French AI firm Mistral, Mercedes is integrating ChatGPT, and Tesla has brought xAI’s Grok to its vehicles.  ",
    "body": "\nGeneral Motors will add a conversational AI assistant powered by Google Gemini to its cars, trucks, and SUVs starting next year, the U.S. automaker said Wednesday during an event in New York City. \nThe Google Gemini rollout is one of several tech-centric announcements made at the automaker’s GM Forward event, and it will be one of the first to get into consumers’ hands. Others, including an overhaul of its electrical architecture and computing platform and an automated driving feature that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road, aren’t coming to GM brands until 2028.\nGM is the latest automaker to lean in to generative AI-based assistants that promise to respond to driver requests in a more natural-sounding way. Stellantis is collaborating with French AI firm Mistral, Mercedes is integrating ChatGPT, and Tesla has brought xAI’s Grok to its vehicles.  \nGM’s integration with Gemini is the next logical step for the automaker. Vehicles produced by GM brands Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC already have “Google built-in,” an operating system that gives drivers access to Google Assistant, Google Maps, and other apps directly from the car’s infotainment screen. In 2023, Google began using Google Cloud’s Dialogflow chatbot to handle non-emergency OnStar features, including common driver queries like routing and navigation assistance. \nGM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will have similar levels of capability — it’ll just perform better, according to Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services. \n“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if you’ve used them, you’ve probably also been frustrated by them because they’re trained on certain code words or they don’t understand accents very well or if you don’t say it quite right, you don’t get the right response,” Richardson told TechCrunch. “What’s great about large language models is they don’t seem to be affected by that. They have context about previous conversations that they can bring up. They’re flexible in how you speak to them … so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.”\nThat might make drafting and sending messages, planning routes with additional stops (like a charging station or a favorite coffee shop), or even prepping for a meeting on the go a more pain-free experience. The assistant will also have access to the web to be able to answer certain questions like, “What’s the history of this bridge I’m driving over?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Gemini assistant will be made available via the Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped vehicles, model year 2015 and above.\nGM’s new voice assistant is a step toward the automaker’s goal of developing its own custom-built AI that connects to your vehicle’s systems through OnStar, GM’s in-car concierge. The way GM executives described the technology at the NYC event, it seems like a mix of a health wearable and an AI pendant, but for your car.\nThe assistant promises to access vehicle data to provide maintenance alerts and route suggestions, explain car features like one-pedal driving, and turn your heat or air conditioning on before you enter the vehicle. \n“The idea here is you take [an existing] large language model, and you train it and refine it on a specific domain,” Richardson said. “We’ll take a base model and train it on the vehicle’s specifications, distill that down, and have that running on the vehicle.”\nWhile GM has a close relationship with Google and will already be implementing Gemini into certain vehicles, Richardson said GM plans to test several foundational models from other AI firms, which could include OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. \nRichardson said drivers will be able to control what information the assistant can access and use, and it can learn from your habits to offer personalized recommendations. GM’s emphasis on user controls is notable given the company’s recent controversy over selling customer driving and geolocation data to insurance brokers. \nRichardson said any data GM gets from drivers goes directly toward improving the product and won’t be sold to bring in additional revenue for the automaker. Over the last nearly two years, GM has brought on a new data team — including Christina Montgomery, who spent 30 years as IBM’s chief privacy and trust officer — to put standard processes and data governance technology in place.\n“Everything that we’re going to do is going to be driven by customer consent, so you can always opt in or opt out,” he said. “Our viewpoint is that data and privacy has to be built into everything that we do.”\nThis article has been updated with comments from Dave Richardson.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nSeveral years ago, as a skunkworks team of engineers inside Rivian set out to develop an electric micromobility vehicle, one question loomed: “What do we build in-house?” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview recounting the early days of Also, which spun out of Rivian earlier this year.\n“We realized the only way to do this well is to build everything,” said Scaringe, who sits on Also’s board. \nThe result, which was revealed Wednesday at an event in Oakland, is a pedal-assist electric bike called the TM-B that is more than just a bike, according to Scaringe and Also president Chris Yu. “This is a whole platform of products we’re going to build in the microspace,” Scaringe said. And Scaringe wasn’t kidding. During the Wednesday event, Also revealed two quad vehicles as well, one of which will be supplied to Amazon.\nAt a passing glance, this “more than a bike” looks like a bike, albeit a sleekly designed one that has a few hidden-in-plain-sight features. But Yu contends that what lies beneath the surface is what makes the TM-B special and compelling enough to break into a crowded e-bike market.\nThe TM-B will come in several trims, including a launch edition, and performance and base versions.\nThe launch edition has identical specs with the performance trim, including a battery that has an estimated 100-mile range, 10 assistive levels, air shocks and air fork for the suspension, and two ride modes, including “sport” that zips the rider down the road. The launch edition, which costs $4,500, is sprinkled with special “launch” colors of a purple ube and blue and will come to market this spring.\nThe performance trim, which also retails at $4,500, is expected to come to market in the first half of 2026. The base version, which has a battery with up to 60 miles of range, five assistive levels, an air shock and coil fork for the suspension, and one standard ride mode, is expected to cost less than $4,000 when it hits the market in the second half of next year, according to Yu.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nAll of the bikes are equipped with front and rear LED lighting with integrated turn signals and have a top speed of 20 miles per hour. Biomotion design illuminates rider’s legs as they pedal on the TM-B, which has 24-inch wheels. The TM-B can also be outfitted with all-terrain tires, pedals, and a trail ride mode that gives riders more manual control over the ride.\nThe battery is removable and comes with USB-C fast charging up to 240 watts that lets users power up devices. \nThe removable battery of the Also e-bike can power other devices.Image Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nThere is an integrated security feature to keep the battery and the bike safe as well. The security system is engaged once the rider walks away from the bike and automatically locks the battery, wheels, and frame. If it is tampered with, the rider will receive an alert via the Also app and the bike will emit a loud honking sound.\nAs a side note: That honking sound can be deployed by the rider as they navigate city streets.\n“You get a push notification in the unfortunate case when it starts moving away because we have LTE and GPS, and we have a real time, location,” Yu said onstage Wednesday. In a worse-case scenario, if the bike is physically picked up and placed in a vehicle, the e-bike owner can remotely disable it.\n“You can brick it,” Yu said. “And this is key, because since we own every board, every piece of software, every part of the bike, that means that no part of this is usable.”\nThe tech inside the TM-B\nImage Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nEverything was developed by the Also and Rivian team, including the removable battery pack, power electronics, software, firmware, and a pedal-by-wire propulsion system that has no mechanical connection between a rider’s pedaling and the movement of the bike. Notably, the system allows for regenerative braking, which means power is sent back into the battery. \nEven the tools to build these elements were designed here, according to Also CTO Jonathan Hall, who spoke to TechCrunch ahead of the event. \nAll of the trims have several standout design and functional features, including a central touchscreen display that is integrated between the handlebars. Perhaps the most interesting is the modular top frame that allows the user to change from a solo, bench, or utility cargo setup within a few seconds.\nImage Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nThe standard solo seat comes with two water bottle cages. The utility setup has an integrated rear rack and one water bottle cage mount and can carry about additional 77 pounds of cargo. Also is offering a third bench option as well. And all of these can be swapped out in a few seconds and without tools.\nNotably, the software of each setup is aligned with that user and syncs with the central touchscreen. \nLike over at Rivian, Also’s software is a central figure of its electric bike and will continue to be used to roll out new features, Yu told TechCrunch. For instance, software is used to provide accurate navigation and ETA to the rider by tightly integrating with the motion and speed of the ebike. \n“Because we know so much about your experience, we know what assist level you’re in, we know what ride load you’re in, we know the average speed that you’ve been going — we can give you a really, really precise ETA,” Yu said while showing off the TM-B onstage. “It sounds simple, but you’re using this as a vehicle to get somewhere. It kind of matters to know when you’re going to get there.”\nThe helmet\nImage Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nThe company also developed a helmet in-house called the Alpha Wave Helmet that uses a newly developed technology to improve rotational impact protection and a redesigned strap so the user can tighten it — no snapping — with one hand.\nThe helmet has numerous tech features beyond protecting your brain, including integrated lights and an audio system with four wind-shielded speakers and two noise-canceling microphones. The helmet syncs with the bike’s central “portal” touchscreen or the rider’s phone so they can listen to music, take calls, and receive turn-by-turn navigation.\n"

    "body": "\nAs the world races to stay ahead in the deep tech revolution — from AI and semiconductors to quantum computing — innovation has become the new currency of power. For many companies, that pressure has translated into heavier workloads and more intense work cultures. Yet they face a real dilemma: they can’t simply ease up while competitors across the globe push harder to win.\nWhen I came across news about the intense “996” work culture — working 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a 72-hour work week — spreading from China to Silicon Valley, it made me wonder how different countries approach work hours and workplace cultures in the tech industry. I was especially curious about how things compare here in South Korea, where I’m currently based.\nIn South Korea, the standard workweek is 40 hours, with up to 12 hours of overtime, usually paid at 1.5 times the regular rate or more. Employers who violate these rules risk fines, executive imprisonment, and civil liability. \nThe 52-hour workweek, introduced in 2018 for large companies with over 300 employees and public institutions, was gradually extended to all businesses and fully took effect on January 1, 2025.\nEarlier this year, South Korea rolled out a special extended work program that lets employees work beyond the 52-hour weekly limit, with both worker consent and government approval, up to 64 hours. For deep tech sectors like semiconductors, approval periods were temporarily extended from three to six months, though local media reports suggest that only a few companies actually took advantage of it. Looking ahead, the South Korean government plans to scale back these special exemptions and tighten working-hour regulations, even as some lawmakers argue that the current guidelines are sufficient, per the report.\nTechCrunch spoke with several tech investors and founders based in South Korea about how the 52-hour workweek limit affects their businesses and their R&D projects as they try to compete with global companies.\n“The 52-hour workweek is indeed a challenging factor when making investment decisions in deep tech sectors,” Yongkwan Lee, CEO of South Korea-based venture capital firm Bluepoint Partners, told TechCrunch. “This is particularly relevant when investing in globally competitive sectors like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. Labor challenges are particularly complex in these sectors, where founders and teams often face intense workloads and long hours during critical growth phases.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAt Bluepoint, early-stage investments are often made before the underlying technologies are fully developed or products are ready for market. In this context, Lee noted that strict limits on working hours could potentially impact the pace at which key business milestones are reached.\nIn South Korea, 70.4% of employees at startup companies responded that they would be willing to work an additional 52 hours per week if adequate compensation is provided, per local reports.\nBohyung Kim, CTO of LeMong, a South Korean startup backed by LG Uplus that delivers agentic AI solutions to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in the food and beverage sector, said the country’s 52-hour workweek system often feels more like a restriction than a protection.\n“Engineers work to find practical solutions to complex problems,” Kim said. “Our work isn’t about completing predefined tasks within fixed hours. It’s about using creativity and deep focus to solve challenges and create new value. When an idea strikes or a technical breakthrough happens, the concept of time disappears. If a system forces you to stop at that moment, it breaks the flow and can actually reduce efficiency.”\nKim added that while short-term, intense focus is crucial as project deadlines approach or when refining key algorithms, rigid legal limits can sometimes get in the way, including depending on the kind of engineering role someone holds. “Even among engineers, production roles in manufacturing differ from R&D positions,” Kim explained. “In manufacturing, productivity is directly linked to working hours, so schedules need to account for industrial safety. Overtime should also be fairly compensated.”\nWhen asked about workplace flexibility, Huiyong Lee, co-founder of LeMong, which makes comment management software, said he thinks figuring out a monthly average would be more practical than adhering strictly to the country’s 52-hour weekly limit. He noted that work intensity often varies depending on the stage of R&D and project timelines in deep tech companies.\n“For companies like ours, intensive development efforts are often required for approximately two weeks prior to a product launch, after which the workload eases once the product stabilizes,” Lee said. “A system with monthly flexibility would allow us to work around 60 hours per week before a launch and 40 hours per week afterward, maintaining an average of 52 hours while ensuring operational efficiency,” Lee continued. “I also believe it is worth considering differentiated standards for deep tech and R&D-focused companies. At the same time, for startups with fewer than 10–20 employees, it is essential to establish more flexible criteria to accommodate their unique operational needs.”\nKim also noted that there is a clear link between performance and hours worked. High-performing team members often tend to put in longer hours, he said. But rather than seeking rewards for the extra time, these top performers focus on achieving results and advancing quickly within the company.\n“Engineers are far more motivated to dive in when their efforts are recognized, whether through performance bonuses, stock options, or acknowledgment of technical contributions,” Kim said. “In high-tech, R&D, and IT industries, as well as in globally competitive firms where technical expertise is key, decisions about flexible work hours should be driven by market logic.”\nAnother Seoul-based venture capitalist, who invests in startups, downplayed the impact of the 52-hour workweek limit on investment decisions.\n“At the moment, there don’t appear to be any major concerns. While it’s always difficult to predict how labor regulations or monitoring practices might evolve, many venture companies today do not strictly track employees’ working hours. To my understanding, there’s currently no requirement for companies to submit formal evidence proving that employees stay within the 52-hour weekly limit.”\nIf an employee were to file a complaint, the VC noted, “the absence of detailed time records could raise compliance questions. That said, most R&D or deeptech firms typically employee highly self-motivated professionals who manage their own schedules responsibly, so such cases seem relatively uncommon.”\nThe greater challenge likely lies in more labor-intensive industries, such as logistics, delivery, or manufacturing, where a large portion of workers earn close to the minimum wage. “In those sectors, the 52-hour workweek regulation can significantly increase labor costs due to mandatory overtime pay and paid leave. As a result, maintaining productivity and achieving economies of scale can become more difficult for businesses operating under tight margins,” this investor said.\nHow other countries work\nTo understand where South Korea’s 52-hour limit fits in the global landscape — and why its deep tech companies feel squeezed between competing pressures — it’s worth examining how other major tech hubs regulate working hours.\nIn Germany, the UK, and France, standard workweeks typically range from 33 to 48 hours. In Australia and Canada, the standard workweek is 38 and 40 hours, respectively, with mandatory overtime pay, offering a balance between labor rights and workplace flexibility.\nIn the U.S., the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets a standard 40-hour workweek. Non-exempt employees earn time-and-a-half for any overtime, and there’s no limit on total hours. (In California, the rules only require double-time pay for certain overtime.) \nIn China, the standard work schedule is also 40 hours per week, or 8 hours a day. Overtime is paid at higher rates: roughly 150% of regular pay on weekdays, 200% on weekends, and 300% on public holidays. In Japan, the standard workweek is 40 hours, with limits of 45 hours of overtime per month and 370 hours per year under normal circumstances. Employers who exceed these limits can face fines and administrative penalties, as in other countries.\nSingapore’s workweek is slightly longer at 44 hours, with a maximum of 72 overtime hours per month. If spread evenly, that’s roughly 62 hours per week. Overtime pay rates are similar: 1.5 times for weekdays, 2 times for rest days, and 3 times for public holidays.\nSouth Korea’s 52-hour cap sits in the middle of this spectrum, stricter than the U.S. and Singapore but more flexible than much of Europe. Either way, for deep tech founders competing globally, the question isn’t just about the number — it’s about whether rigid weekly limits can accommodate the intense, uneven workflows that characterize early-stage R&D.\n"

    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n5:30 AM PST · December 10, 2025\n\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nGoogle on Wednesday launched its more affordable AI Plus plan in India as it seeks to compete on pricing with other low-cost AI offerings, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Go subscription.\nFor new users in India, Google is offering AI Plus for ₹199 ($2.21) per month, for the first six months, after which you’ll have to pay ₹399 ($4.44) a month.\nThe AI Plus plan gives users higher limits for Gemini 3 Pro and image editing model Nano Banana Pro; access to video generation in the Gemini and Flow apps; expanded access to deep research in NotebookLM; and 200GB of storage across Photos, Drive, and Gmail. Subscribers can give access to family members, too.\nBefore this, Google’s cheapest AI subscription available in the country was AI Pro, which was priced at ₹1,950 per month ($21.69).\nBut Google is late to customize its pricing for India, as the AI Plus plan was first introduced in Indonesia in September and offered it in other countries that same month. OpenAI debuted its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan in India in August and made it available in other countries in subsequent months. The plan allows users to have 10 times more limits than the free plan for messages, image generation, and file uploads.\nAI companies have been busy offering freebies in India as they seek to tap its huge population for users. First, Perplexity partnered with telco Airtel to offer its Pro plan for a year to all Airtel customers for free. OpenAI also offered ChatGPT Go free for a year to existing subscribers of Go and new users.\nMeanwhile, Google teamed up with telco Reliance Jio to offer its AI Pro plan for 18 months at no cost to users on a certain carrier plan.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nReddit is starting a limited test of verified profiles, which places a grey checkmark beside the username of a notable person or business.\n“This feature is designed to help redditors understand who they’re engaging with in moments when verification matters, whether it’s an expert or celebrity hosting an AMA, a journalist reporting news, or a brand sharing information,” Reddit wrote in a blog post.\nBelieve it or not, there used to be a time on the internet where a verification checkmark simply just confirmed that a notable figure is who they say they are, and was not a signifier that you are paying a monthly fee to Elon Musk and/or Mark Zuckerberg. But Reddit has decided that perhaps it is, actually, a good idea to verify the accounts of public figures in an attempt to mitigate the spread of misinformation. \nReddit acknowledges that pseudonymity is a key part of its culture, allowing users to express themselves more openly than they would if their real name was attached to everything they say. But Reddit says that this feature is completely voluntary and opt-in. The verification feature is less so about denoting a special elite status, but making it easier for both ordinary users and subreddit moderators to quickly verify that someone is being truthful about their identity.\nThe absence of a checkmark doesn’t mean someone is a fraud, though. Reddit is piloting this feature with a small batch of profiles, and even if the checkmarks get a full rollout, it’s still possible that some famous Redditors won’t get a check.\nTony Hawk, for example, posts very casually on skateboarding subreddits, simply chatting about his favorite sport with likeminded fans. He’s just like us! But he does blow up his spot a bit when he shares his own skating videos on r/OldSkaters, because there probably aren’t many 57-year-olds doing heel flips.\n\nWhile Reddit’s checkmarks are in their alpha rollout, users will be eligible if they’re active contributors in good standing and “trusted partners,” which Reddit did not specify. Having a checkmark doesn’t give a user any special privileges. However, users will not be eligible for a checkmark if they are an NSFW profile, or if they primarily engage in NSFW communities. \nFor now, Reddit is manually verifying profiles, but says it will use a third-party process in the future.\nIt’s probably not a coincidence that Reddit is exploring verification at the same time that its co-founder Alexis Ohanian is launching a reboot of the social aggregator, Digg. Digg’s founders have expressed concern that the internet is becoming flooded with bots and AI agents, and they want Digg to be a place where people can connect with actual humans. They’ve said they’re looking into using zero-knowledge proofs as a potential way to verify that users are human.\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has also been exploring means of verifying people’s humanity online. World, Altman’s human verification project, is expected to release an app this week that also focuses on keeping out bots.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

It added that generation models like Nano Banana are good for creating images, but users often need granular tools for editing that work without any text prompts. \nFigma has improved its lasso tool for selection. Now you can use it to select an object, remove it, or isolate it to move it around. When you move around the object, the image still retains other characteristics, such as background and color. Users can also select an object to adjust factors like lighting, shadow, color, or focus.\nThe company is also bringing an image-expansion feature to its design suite. This feature is handy when you are adjusting a creative for a particular format and need to fill in the background or other details. For instance, creating a web banner or mobile banner from a 1×1 image. It essentially saves you from constantly cropping an image and adjusting elements within it.\nImage Credits:Figma\nBesides adding these features, Figma is collating all its image-editing tools in one toolbar for easier access. You can select objects or parts of images, change background color, and add annotations or text using this toolbar. The company said removing background is one of the most common actions on the platform, and that is why it is getting a prominent spot on the new toolbar.\nRivals like Adobe and Canva have had object removal for a few years now. Figma is finally catching up to offer these features. \nThe company said the new image-editing features are available on Figma Design and Draw, with plans to make them available across Figma tools next year.\nFigma’s launch comes on the same day as Adobe making some of these features available to users within ChatGPT. Figma was one of the launch partners of the app, calling on ChatGPT in October. It is not clear if these new functions will be available to users using Figma within OpenAI’s tool. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify announced on Wednesday that, for the first time, it’s giving users more control over the streaming service’s algorithm. That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.\nThe feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.\nThe new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.\nThe feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, which debuted last year, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. \nIn addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. \nFor instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.”\nImage Credits:Spotify\nIn another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes.\nThe company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.\nSpotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting users take control of its algorithm. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAmazon says it will allow authors to offer their DRM-free e-books in the EPUB and PDF formats through its self-publishing platform, Kindle Direct Publishing. Starting on January 20, 2026, authors who set their titles as DRM-free will see their books made available in these more open formats.\nThe decision to use Digital Rights Management (DRM), a copyright protection mechanism, is set by the authors when they publish their e-books on Amazon’s platform.\nThe company notes these changes won’t impact previously published titles. If authors want to change the status of older titles, they’ll have to log into the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) author portal and change an option in the settings. (Instructions on how to make that change are on Amazon’s KDP support site.)\nThis move may actually incentivize authors to apply DRM to their e-books.\nAs one author on the KDP Community forums, Leslie Anne Perry, noted, “Previously, I have not enabled DRM on my e-books. My thinking was that I wanted folks to be able to download them to other devices within their own household. However, I think I will enable it on any future e-books. I’m not sure I want people to be able to download them as a PDFs [sic].”\nAnother member pushed back at the complaints, arguing that it doesn’t really increase privacy, as those who had wanted to could always dump the existing DRM-free Kindle file into software to convert it into an EPUB or PDF.\nAmazon is positioning the new feature as making it “easier” for readers to enjoy the content they’ve already purchased, but the reality is that authors would have to opt in if they want to open up access to their older works. To remove the DRM, authors will have to click a box that says, “I understand that by not applying DRM, customers who buy and have already bought this book will be able to download it as a PDF or EPUB file.”\nElsewhere, Amazon has been making it more difficult for Kindle owners to share or back up their e-books through heavier use of DRM in recent months.\nWith an update to Kindle’s software for 11th- and 12th-generation devices, the retailer introduced a new DRM system that made it impossible for Kindle users to back up their e-books without jailbreaking their device. This had followed an earlier change to remove the download and transfer options via USB, which angered many Kindle owners.\nAfter the author updates their e-book’s DRM status, Amazon says the changes will take up to 72 hours before they are live on Amazon.com.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The e-commerce giant says it will expand the service to additional cities in 2026. \nAmazon launched the ability to order perishable items via Same-Day Delivery in August, a move that was seen as a way for the company to compete more directly with Instacart and Walmart+ in the quick-commerce space.\nSince launch, customers have ordered fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and frozen foods alongside electronics, books, pantry staples, and snacks, as well as everyday household essentials like paper towels and toothpaste.\nAmazon says its “specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” ensures that shoppers receive perishable groceries intact, and that orders undergo a six-point quality check upon arrival and before leaving for delivery. Plus, temperature-sensitive products are delivered in insulated bags.\nFresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered items for fast delivery, Amazon says.\nThe top bestsellers for Same-Day Delivery are bananas, Haas avocados, strawberries, honeycrisp apples, limes, blueberries, blackberries, organic bananas, navel oranges, and bathroom tissues.\nThe company also notes that perishable grocery sales have grown 30 times since January, and that customers who add fresh groceries to their Same-Day Delivery orders shop about twice as often as those who don’t.\nSame-day delivery is free for orders worth more than $25 for Prime members. If an order doesn’t meet the minimum amount, subscribers can still choose same-day delivery for a $2.99 fee. For customers without a Prime membership, the service is available with a $12.99 fee, regardless of the order size.\nAmazon says it has grown its perishable selection available for Same-Day Delivery by over 30% since August, and has included thousands of popular items from Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon said on Wednesday it will invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment in the country to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations in the South Asian nation.\nThe e-commerce giant said the new investment will support its efforts to digitize small businesses and strengthen its logistics and operations footprint in India. The company said it aims to enable AI access for up to 15 million small businesses and generate 1 million direct, indirect, induced, and seasonal jobs by 2030.\nCiting an Economic Impact Report by Keystone Strategy, Amazon said it has invested nearly $40 billion in India to date. In 2023, Amazon said it would invest $15 billion in the country by 2030 — of that, $12.7 billion was earmarked for its cloud business through Amazon Web Services. \nAmazon’s new plan comes just a day after Microsoft said it would invest $17.5 billion in India by 2029. And in October, Google said it would spend $15 billion to build an AI hub and data center infrastructure in the country.\nIndia is an important market for Big Tech, drawn by its huge populace, which features more than a billion internet users and hundreds of millions of smartphone users. The country has also attracted interest from AI firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, as a large share of the population comes online for the first time and a growing developer base accelerates the adoption of generative AI applications.\n“One of the things that I look for is what’s happening here,” said Russell Grandinetti, senior VP of international stores at Amazon, at the company’s annual small business-focused Smbhav event in New Delhi. “That’s inevitably going to become part of how we run our business around the world.”\nAmazon faces strong competition in India from Walmart-backed Flipkart, Meesho, and quick-commerce firms such as Swiggy’s Instamart, Zomato’s Blinkit, and Zepto, which are expanding fast and targeting the same urban consumer base. However, with its immense logistics network and more than 1.7 million sellers, the company does enjoy scale advantages in the market.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“India continues to be Amazon’s one of the largest long-term opportunities,” said Amit Aggarwal, senior VP of emerging markets at Amazon.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Instagram says your list of interests is determined by your activity and summarized by AI.\nFor example, you might see a description that reads: “Lately you’ve been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, and skateboarding.” You can choose to share this description to your Story, so your followers can see what you’re into, kind of like you do with your Spotify Wrapped results.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nUnderneath the summary, you will see the list of topics that Instagram thinks you’re interested in. You can select which topics you want to see more or less of, and your recommendations will adapt accordingly. Plus, if you’re interested in a topic that isn’t listed, you can type it in to add it to your list of interests. \nThe move follows TikTok’s rollout of its “Manage Topics” feature last year, which allows users to take greater control over what they see on their For You feed. Similar to Instagram’s new feature, TikTok lets you tailor your feed to show more or less of certain topics.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nHowever, unlike TikTok, which only displays around a dozen generic topic categories, Instagram’s list is personalized to you and lets you add additional topics. \nThe new Instagram tool is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and will roll out globally in English soon. \nIn the future, people will be able to use the Your Algorithm tool to personalize their Explore feed, Instagram says. The company plans to bring the tool to more places in the app as well.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe Calibri font is the latest government worker to be fired from the Trump administration for its association with diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. \nIn an action that reads like a story from The Onion (and will certainly be fodder for “Saturday Night Live” or “South Park”), U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has banned the font and ordered diplomats to use Times New Roman for official documents instead, the New York Times reported after obtaining a leaked memo on the topic. \nCalibri, which is a sans-serif font, was apparently adopted in 2023 during Biden’s tenure. It was chosen by the department’s then-DEI office, which has since been disbanded under Rubio amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directives. \nThe font was chosen in an effort to make documents easier to read for the vision impaired. Sans-serif fonts are those without decorative swirls and lines at the ends of letters. With their cleaner lines and slightly wider letter spacing, they are considered more accessible for people with issues ranging from dyslexia to low vision (although research on how much the serifs themselves impact readability has been inconclusive).  \nRubio’s memo has designated Times New Roman as his tenure’s official font, stating it will “restore decorum and professionalism” to documents. Rubio did admit in the memo that Calibri wasn’t the “most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful” example of DEI to his mind’s eye, but he still berated the font for contributing to “the degradation” of the State Department’s official correspondence.  \nMany people across the political spectrum dislike Calibri (according to an informal survey of TechCrunch writers) but all the same, that’s a harsh criticism for a font. \nApparently, there were rumblings within the department in 2023 when Calibri was first adopted, the New York Times reported. Font choices inspire the same kind of love/hate passions as sports teams. Everyone has their favorites and their rivalries. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile Calibri declined to comment to TechCrunch on how woke it actually was, many people would agree that Times New Roman is a particularly old-timey font.

    "body": "\nOverview Energy emerged from stealth today with a plan to use the world’s solar panels as nighttime collectors of power beamed down from space.\nThe startup plans to use large solar arrays in geosynchronous orbit — about 22,000 miles above the Earth where satellites match the planet’s rotation —  to harvest sunlight. It will then use infrared lasers to transmit that power to utility-scale solar farms on Earth, allowing them to send power to the grid nearly round the clock. \nOverview has raised $20 million to date, and part of that money has gone toward an airborne demonstration of its power beaming technology. A light aircraft transmitted power using a laser to a ground receiver over a distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles).\nInvestors include the Aurelia Institute, Earthrise Ventures, Engine Ventures, EQT Foundation, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prime Movers Lab.\nAs space launch costs have declined over the past decade or so, space-based power has gone from pure science fiction to something closer to reality. \nThere are still several hurdles to overcome: For one, it’s still significantly cheaper to deploy solar panels here on Earth than to send them into space. And the ability to send power wirelessly from orbit down to our planet’s surface is still in its infancy.\nOther companies are attempting the same feat. Aetherflux is also pursuing a laser-based approach. Others like Emrod and Orbital Composites/Virtus Solis are developing microwave-based power transmission, which sends energy wirelessly using a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than Aetherflux and Overview. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMicrowaves are less sensitive to clouds and humidity than infrared lasers, which can’t transmit in cloudy weather since the suspended water droplets would absorb much of the energy. But because microwave-based systems can’t reuse existing solar farms, they would have to build their own ground stations. \nTo keep costs down, those ground receivers would probably be smaller, so the energy beams would have to be tighter and more powerful. Companies are developing ways to swiftly interrupt the beam to prevent collateral damage to birds and aircraft, but it’s still a concern.\nOverview’s reuse of solar farms would mitigate some of those concerns, though it would still have to convince the public that energy beams from space are safe and won’t stray off target. (Remember SimCity 2000?) The company will also have to ensure its laser system is very efficient, otherwise the benefit of collecting sunlight in space will evaporate as the energy is converted to infrared light and back again.\nThe startup says that in 2028 it intends to launch a satellite into low Earth orbit — far below the 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) at which it ultimately intends to operate. If all goes as planned, it’ll start sending megawatts’ worth of power from geosynchronous orbit in 2030.\nIf it sounds audacious, it is. Overview isn’t just confronting some promising but potentially unforgiving physics problems but will also be battling grid-scale batteries, which are getting cheaper every year, and potentially nuclear fusion. But enough people believe it will happen that specialty suppliers have started popping up. A sci-fi future, indeed.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV is launching more than 10 genre-specific channel packages in early 2026, the Google-owned company announced on Wednesday. The move will mark the first time YouTube TV breaks up its cable-like channel bundle.\nThe new packages will give consumers more flexibility over the content that they want to pay for. \nThe upcoming lineup of bundles includes one dedicated to sports that will include access to all the major broadcasters, as well as sports networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, as well as ESPN Unlimited. Customers will be able to include add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone.\nYouTube notes that users will still get access to popular features like unlimited DVR, multiview, key plays, and fantasy view. \nAlthough YouTube didn’t share the full list of upcoming bundles, the company said there will be news, family, and entertainment packages. \nBy adding genre-specific plans, YouTube TV likely hopes to attract users who don’t want to pay the full $82.99 per month price for content when they only want to access specific programming. Additionally, people who are tired of continuous price hikes may be more inclined to stay with the service if they can shave some dollars off of their monthly subscription. \nYouTube TV currently charges $82.99 per month for its base plans, which include live and on-demand content from major broadcasters and networks. While the upcoming smaller bundles will cost less than YouTube TV’s base plan, the company hasn’t detailed pricing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“TV should be easy, giving viewers greater control over what they want to watch,” said Christian Oestlien, YouTube VP, head of subscriptions, in a blog post. “Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options. Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family and entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.”\nThe move comes as TV providers have launched lower-cost streaming packages that focus on specific genres. \nFor example, DirecTV offers “genre packs” for sports, entertainment, news, kids’ content, and more. Plus, Fubo launched a sports package in August. An older player in the space, Sling TV, has long advocated for à la carte bundles, too.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle is testing AI-powered article overviews on participating publications’ Google News pages as part of a new pilot program, the search giant announced on Wednesday. \nNews publishers participating in the pilot program include Der Spiegel, El País, Folha, Infobae, Kompas, The Guardian, The Times of India, The Washington Examiner, and The Washington Post, among others.\nThe purpose of the new commercial partnership program is to “explore how AI can drive more engaged audiences,” Google said in a blog post. As part of the new AI pilot program, the company will work with publishers to experiment with new features in Google News.\nBy adding AI-powered article overviews, Google says users will get more context before they click through to read an article. While AI-generated summaries may lead to fewer clicks on news articles, publications participating in the commercial pilot program will receive direct payments from Google, which could make up for the potential decrease in traffic to their sites. \nThe AI-powered article overviews will only appear on participating publications’ Google News pages, and not anywhere else on Google News or in Search.\nThis isn’t the first time that Google has introduced AI summaries for news. In July, the company rolled out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google’s search app. With this change, users no longer see a single headline from a major publication in the feed. Instead, they see the logos of multiple news publishers in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.\nGoogle is also experimenting with audio briefings for people who prefer listening to the news rather than reading it, as part of the new pilot program. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company says these features will include clear attribution and a link to articles.\nAdditionally, Google is partnering with organizations such as Estadão, Antara, Yonhap, and The Associated Press to incorporate real-time information and enhance results in the Gemini app. \n“As the way people consume information evolves, we’ll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem,” Google wrote in its blog post. “We’re doing this work in collaboration with websites and creators of all sizes, from major news publishers to new and emerging voices.”\nImage Credits:Google\nAs part of Google’s Wednesday announcement, the company said that it’s launching its “Preferred Sources” feature globally after first launching it in the U.S. and India in August. The feature allows users to select their favorite news sites and blogs to appear in the Top Stories section of Google search results.\nIn the coming days, the feature will be available for English-language users worldwide, and Google plans to roll it out to all supported languages early next year.\nGoogle will now also highlight links from your news subscriptions and show these links in a dedicated carousel in the Gemini app in the coming weeks, with AI Overviews and AI Mode to follow.\nWhile these features make it easy for users to access news from their preferred sources, they also risk confining them to an ideological bubble that limits their exposure to different perspectives.\nGoogle also announced that it’s increasing the number of inline links in AI Mode.

    "description": "Google is rolling out managed MCP servers to make its services “agent-ready by design,” starting with Maps and BigQuery, aiming to simplify messy integrations and help AI agents use real tools.",
    "body": "\nAI agents are being sold as the solution for planning trips, answering business questions, and solving problems of all kinds, but getting them to work with tools and data outside their chat interfaces has been tricky. Developers have to patch together various connectors and keep them running, but that’s a fragile approach that’s hard to scale and creates governance headaches.\nGoogle claims it’s trying to solve that by launching its own fully managed, remote MCP servers that would make its Google and Cloud services — like Maps and BigQuery — easier for agents to plug into.\nThe move follows the launch of Google’s latest Gemini 3 model, and the company is looking to pair stronger reasoning with more dependable connections to real-world tools and data.\n“We are making Google agent-ready by design,” Steren Giannini, product management director at Google Cloud, told TechCrunch. \nInstead of spending a week or two setting up connectors, developers can now essentially paste in a URL to a managed endpoint, Giannini said.\nAt launch, Google is starting with MCP servers for Maps, BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine. In practice, this might look like an analytics assistant querying BigQuery directly, or an ops agent interacting with infrastructure services. \nIn the case of Maps, Giannini said, without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. “But by giving your agent […] a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning,” he added.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the MCP servers will eventually be offered across all of Google’s tools, they are initially launching under public preview, meaning they’re not yet fully covered by Google Cloud terms of service. They are, however, being offered at no extra cost to enterprise customers that already pay for Google services. \n“We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, adding that he expects more MCP servers to trickle in every week.\nMCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic about a year ago as an open source standard to connect AI systems with data and tools. The protocol has been widely adopted across the agent tooling world, and Anthropic earlier this week donated MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund dedicated to open sourcing and standardizing AI agent infrastructure. \n“The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client,” Giannini said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how many more clients will emerge.”\nOne can think of MCP clients as the AI apps on the other end of the wire that talk to MCP servers and call the tools they offer. For Google, that includes Gemini CLI and AI Studio. Giannini said he’s also tried it with Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT as clients, and “they just work.”\nGoogle argues this isn’t just about connecting agents to its services. The bigger enterprise play is Apigee, its API management product, which many companies already use to issue API keys, set quotas, and monitor traffic. \nGiannini said Apigee can essentially “translate” a standard API into an MCP server, turning endpoints like a product catalog API into tools an agent can discover and use, with existing security and governance controls layered on top. \nIn other words, the same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too. \nGoogle’s new MCP servers are protected by a permission mechanism called Google Cloud IAM, which explicitly protects what an agent can do with that server. They are also protected by Google Cloud Model Armor, which Giannini describes as a firewall dedicated to agentic workloads that defends against advanced agentic threats like prompt injection and data exfiltration. Administrators can also rely on audit logging for additional observability. \nGoogle plans to expand MCP support beyond the initial set of servers. In the next few months, the company will roll out support for services across areas like storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security.\n“We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to,” Giannini said.\n"

    "body": "\nOboe, a learning startup from Anchor co-founders and former Spotify execs Nir Zicherman and Michael Mignano, said today it has raised $16 million in Series A funding led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Eniac, Haystack, Offline, and Factorial. The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D’Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.\nThat platform, which officially launched in September, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. \nThe startup’s fundraise comes three months after the app’s launch and a year after it raised a $4 million seed round. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.\n“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” \n“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.\nBryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn’t make users wait behind a loading indicator. \n“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe company is making changes to its core course-generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.\nImage Credits:Oboe\nWith the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics. What’s more, users will see other modalities like quizzes appear within the course material seamlessly. For some courses, Oboe will also generate flashcards for you to easily remember course materials.\nIn terms of audio, instead of having to choose between a podcast format and a lecture format, the company generates a podcast for you and changes its tone based on the learning material and other signals from users. \nImage Credits:Oboe\nZicherman said that the company observed that there is a high demand among users to learn about STEM topics (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). The startup has worked on sourcing the best material for these topics, including programming.\nHe said that good teachers decide what is the best way of learning for students and the company is taking that approach of designing courses for learners.\nImage Credits:Oboe\nOboe is revamping its pricing model to give unlimited course generation to users. \nHowever, if they want to dive deeper into a topic, they can pay $15 a month ($144 per year) to access more course chapters. There is also a $40 per month ($384 per year) Pro plan, which gives unlimited chapter access and allows users to export or download courses for consumption outside Oboe. The startup said this is suitable for students who want to take printouts of the study material and consume it offline.\nZicherman said that right now Oboe is offering courses in English, but it wants to reach different parts of the world better with localized courses and language support. The platform is currently available on the web, with mobile support planned for the future. \nIn the last few years, multiple tools, including Google’s NotebookLM and ex-Google employees’ Huxe, allow you to enter a prompt to get a podcast episode to explore a topic. While these are one-off generations, Oboe’s approach is to let you dive deeper into the topic with chapter-based learning.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

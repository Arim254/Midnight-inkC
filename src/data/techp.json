The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that “none of [OpenAI’s] best people” took the offers.\n“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in the memo to staff.\nThis line of thinking tracks with Meta’s recent “year of efficiency” — a more sanitized way to describe the company’s mass layoffs. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that “leaner is better.”\nNow, it seems that Meta isn’t lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts. The company claims that most of these people impacted today should be able to find another job within Meta. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nDating app giant Tinder announced on Wednesday that it’s expanding its facial-verification feature to more users in the U.S. \nThe facial-verification feature, known as Face Check, requires new users to verify their identity by submitting a short video selfie. This initiative aims to reduce impersonation on the platform and ensure that people are not connected to bots or fake accounts.\nFace Check creates a 3D video scan of the user’s face to verify its similarity with their profile pictures. Members who successfully complete the verification process earn a badge on their profiles, indicating to others that they have been verified. Additionally, the feature identifies whether the same face is utilized across different accounts, providing an additional safeguard against impersonation and fraudulent profiles.\nTinder says that the video selfies are deleted shortly after review but that it keeps a “non-reversible, encrypted face map and face vector,” which help verify new photos, spot fraud, and stop people from making duplicate accounts. \nImage Credits:Tinder\nThe Face Check feature has already been in place in California since June, as well as in Colombia and Canada. It’s also now available in Australia, India, and other countries across Southeast Asia. \nFace Check will roll out to additional U.S. states in the coming months. It will also roll out to other dating apps owned by parent company Match Group in 2026.\nUsers have been leaving the Tinder app in recent years because of issues related to safety and privacy, along with unfavorable encounters with other users.

The idea behind the glasses is to give delivery drivers a hand-free experience that reduces the need to keep looking between their phone, the package they’re delivering, and their surroundings.\nThe e-commerce giant says the glasses will allow delivery drivers to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery, all without using their phones. The glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision alongside cameras to create a display that includes things like hazards and delivery tasks. \nAmazon likely hopes that the new glasses will shave time off of each delivery by providing delivery drivers with detailed directions and information about hazards directly in their line of sight.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nWhen a driver parks at a delivery location, Amazon says the glasses automatically activate. The glasses help the driver locate the package inside the vehicle and then navigate to the delivery address. The glasses can provide easy-to-follow directions in places like multi-unit apartment complexes and business locations.  \nThe glasses are paired with a controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery, and a dedicated emergency button. \nAmazon notes that the glasses also support prescription lenses and transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe retailer is currently trialing the glasses with delivery drivers in North America and plans to refine the technology before a wider rollout.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported last year that Amazon was working on the smart glasses. \nIn the future, Amazon says the glasses will be able to provide drivers with “real-time defect detection” that could notify them if they accidentally drop off a package at the wrong address. The glasses will also be able to detect pets in yards and automatically adjust to hazards like low light conditions.\nAlso on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled a new robotic arm called “Blue Jay” that can work alongside warehouse employees to pick items off shelves and sort them.

    "description": "Apple has pulled the controversial dating safety apps Tea and TeaOnHer from the App Store over violations of its content moderation and privacy rules, following a flood of user complaints and reports of minors’ data being exposed",
    "body": "\nControversial dating safety apps, Tea and TeaOnHer, have been pulled from the Apple App Store. The apps’ removal was first spotted by the app store intelligence provider Appfigures, which told TechCrunch the two apps were removed from the App Store on Tuesday in all markets, but remain live on Google Play.\nReached for comment, Apple confirmed the apps’ removal, saying it removed Tea Dating Advice and TeaOnHer from the App Store because they failed to meet Apple’s requirements around content moderation and user privacy. The company also said it saw an excessive number of user complaints and negative reviews, which included complaints of minors’ personal information being posted in these apps.\nApple communicated the issues to the developers of the apps, a representative said, but the complaints were not addressed. (Request for comment from the app developers have not yet been returned.)\nSpecifically, Apple cited violations of its App Review Guidelines 1.2, 5.1.2, and 5.6. Rule 1.2 says apps with user-generated content should offer reporting and blocking features, and should remove objectionable content. Rule 5.1.2 says apps can’t use or share someone’s personal information without permission, and 5.6 says excessive customer reports and negative reviews violate Apple’s Developer Code of Conduct. \nTea and TeaOnHer have generated a lot of headlines and interest since going viral earlier this year. Tea, which had quietly existed since 2023 before picking up steam in 2025, was pitched as a dating safety tool for women, somewhat similar to the “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” Facebook Groups. The app encouraged women to spill details about men, particularly those on dating apps. This included their personal information, Yelp-style reviews, and whether they’d dub them a “green flag” or “red flag.”\nMany men, however, didn’t appreciate the app’s invasion into their privacy and questioned whether sharing information like this could be considered defamation.\nAfter going viral and generating controversy, Tea suffered a data breach over the summer, with hackers gaining access to 72,000 images, including 3,000 selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts, comments, and direct messages.  \nLater, a rival app called TeaOnHer launched to offer men the ability to dish on women in the same way, but it was beset by security issues that exposed users’ personal information, including government IDs and selfies, TechCrunch discovered in August.  \nAppfigures says the Tea app saw 6.1 million total lifetime downloads and had generated $5 million in gross revenue to date. TeaOnHer had 2.2 million downloads and didn’t offer in-app purchases. It notes the apps remain live on Google Play for now. \nWith their App Store removal, however, copycats are gaining traction. For instance, an app called TeaOnHer and Him – Overheard has 354,000 total downloads and has jumped from No. 90 on the Overall Top App Charts to No. 27.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb.

    "body": "\nAfter months of speculation, Samsung has finally unveiled its Galaxy XR headset to take on Apple’s Vision Pro. The headset runs on Google’s Android XR operating system and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 platform.\nGalaxy XR costs $1,800, nearly half the price of the Vision Pro. It’s available now in the U.S. and Korea. The headset offers up to two hours of general use and up to two and a half hours of video playback. \nThe headset’s micro OLED display has 27 million pixels, six million more than the Vision Pro, and a resolution of 3,552 x 3,840. It has a 90Hz refresh rate, compared to the Vision Pro’s 120Hz. Galaxy XR features two high-resolution pass-through cameras, six world-facing tracking cameras, and four eye-tracking cameras.\nThe headset weighs 545g, while the latest Apple Vision Pro weighs around 750g-800g. \nImage Credits:Samsung\n“Through a combination of its shape, advanced materials and the structural optimization of each component, Galaxy XR achieves an optimal balance between lightweight design and robustness for daily use,” Samsung wrote in a blog post. “The headset’s ergonomically balanced frame distributes pressure across the forehead and the back of the head, minimizing facial discomfort while providing steady support.”\nSamsung says the headset features many experiences optimized for XR, such as Google Maps, YouTube, Circle to Search, and Google Photos.\nUsers can ask Gemini to navigate to places on Google Maps while exploring the world in immersive 3D Maps. On YouTube, users can ask Gemini to find content they want to see and learn more about the video they’re watching. Users can also convert 2D images into 3D in Photos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn pass-through mode, users can see the physical world around them and draw a circle with their hand to search for information about anything in front of them.\nImage Credits:Google\nWith the headset, users can multitask by having multiple apps open at any size, such as their browser, documents, and music app. \nAs for entertainment, users can stream content on a 4K micro OLED screen. Streaming services, including Crunchyroll, HBO Max, and Peacock, have reworked their apps for Android XR.\nPeople who purchase the Galaxy XR by the end of the year will get an Explorer Pack that comes with 12 months of Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium, and Google Play Pass. It also comes with a $1 per month trial of YouTube TV for three months, access to the 2025-2026 season of NBA League Pass, and access to Status Pro’s NFL PRO ERA, Project Pulsar from Adobe, Asteroid, and Calm.\nThe move comes as Apple last week unveiled the latest version of its Vision Pro headset that’s powered by an M5 chip, replacing the current M2. The M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz). The headset also features 30 more minutes of battery life over the previous model, coming in at two and a half hours of general use and three hours of video playback.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJustin Wenig remembers his days at Y Combinator in 2019. \nBack then, he was working with his first startup, Coursedog, which looked to provide more modern tools to higher-educational facilities, including those that work with state departments. He learned quickly that his peers didn’t like working with the public sector — too much bureaucracy.\nEven finding out basic information, like what a school district purchased in the past year, required a lot of paperwork.\n“Out of hundreds of startups, only a handful of us were trying to modernize how government and education worked,” Wenig told TechCrunch. “Investors thought it was too slow, too bureaucratic, too hard to scale. And to be fair, they weren’t wrong. Selling to the public sector was painful.”\nHe sold Coursedog in 2021 for nine figures to JMI Equity and remains on the board. In 2024, he launched Starbridge, a platform that helps business sales teams monitor opportunities in the public sector so they can then take action, such as submitting proposals or drafting bids for grants and budgets. On Wednesday, Starbridge announced a $42 million Series A led by David Sacks’ firm Craft Ventures.\nWenig said the greatest challenges in public sector is that data is fragmented and inaccessible.\n“Critical buying information is scattered across PDFs, agency websites, meeting minutes, and outdated directories,” he said, adding that vendors spend hours trying to piece together who to contact and other insights.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Starbridge\nStarbridge pulls public web data sources from such sources and puts the information in one place. The sales team using the platform can see a ranked scoring, courtesy of Starbridge, of which public sector accounts are most likely to purchase new technology, and see updates like leadership changes or new initiatives.\n“Instead of chasing noise, our customers have a clear, data-backed view of where to focus and when to act,” he said. \nWenig described his fundraising journey as “fun,” and said the company met Craft through a friend. Others in the Series A round include Owl Ventures, Commonweal Ventures, and Autotech Ventures. The company has raised $52 million to date, after previously raising a $10 million seed.\nNext, the startup plans to launch “Starbridge integrated experience,” so users do not have to always go to the Starbridge platform to use its technology.\n“Every competitor goes right to your CRM, every question about an account can be answered right from a slackbot, every job change loads right into your sequencer,” Wenig said.\nOthers in this space include GovWin and GovSpend. Starbridge said it’s different because it has built AI workflows on top of the datasets to make it easier for sales teams to use.\nHe remembers back when he was fundraising for Coursedog. “No VC was interested in talking to us,” he said. But now, in the AI era, the tides are shifting, he said.\n“Maybe nobody wants to run for office anymore, but they do want to build,” he continued. “Seeing this new wave of mission-driven founders tackling real, systemic challenges makes me incredibly hopeful for the future.”\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCloud monitoring and security platform Datadog has solved an age-old joke: what’s updog?\nDatadog’s answer is not, “Not much, you?” Rather, the company launched a web dashboard that shows developers the status of dozens of services and tools like AWS, Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Slack — essentially letting them check whether major software providers are functioning properly. The tool is free, so anyone can check Updog to find out if major SaaS providers are up… dog.\nDatadog clearly had fun with this branding, as they should. Rhys Sullivan, a software engineer, said in an X post in June, “you’re telling me that datadog has an uptime monitoring product and they didn’t call it ‘updog’?”\nFour months later, Datadog engineer Tim Brown replied, “here you go,” and linked to the newly launched Updog.\n\nSullivan’s initial tweet was actually referring to the branding of a tool within the paid Datadog platform, which provides more in-depth monitoring tools, whereas Updog, which is free, is for more general use. Anyone can check the status of popular online services without needing a Datadog subscription.\nJokes aside, Updog seems like it will be a useful free tool for developers — and it probably would’ve come in handy on Monday, when a day-long AWS outage took a great portion of the web offline, including some banks, payment processors, and government services.\nDatadog says that its Updog dashboard is set apart by its use of AI, which can identify subtle patterns in telemetry — the transmission and collection of remote data from servers and services — that can surface potential outages more quickly. If Updog can successfully pull this off, that foreknowledge can make a difference for businesses that depend on SaaS tools for everything from collecting payments to accessing cloud-stored data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Updog.ai recently surfaced an Amazon DynamoDB degradation 32 minutes before AWS updated its own status page,” Datadog wrote in a blog post.\nWhile a company may not always be able to avoid major collapses like this week’s AWS outage, knowing about service issues early can at least give companies extra time to assess their situation, and that’s what’s Updog. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Rivian, the EV maker where Also was born, is backed by Amazon and has supplied the company with more than 25,000 of its electric delivery vans.\n“We really understand how to work with each other,” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch ahead of the event, adding that everything they learned from the EDV van program was poured into this project. “This is where having Rivian as a large shareholder is very handy because we can do all this tight coordination through one fleet management portal that manages your large vehicles, like the EDV vans, and the Also products.”\nThe advantage is knowing exactly what Amazon needs, Scaringe added. “There’s no guesswork and Also has benefited from a lot of input from the Rivian team, which has been involved, because they’re so close to Amazon.\nAlso started as a skunkworks within Rivian and spun out of the EV maker earlier this year with a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures. Also is a standalone company, but it has close ties with Rivian, which holds a minority stake. Scaringe will serve on its board, and Also will use — and already has — the automaker’s tech, retail presence, and economies of scale. \nImage Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nThe TM-Q and Also’s TM-B ebike share much of the same DNA, including the drivetrain, a pedal-by-wire system developed by Also. Even some of the physical elements, notably the handlebars and a built-in five-inch circular touchscreen that can be turned to lock and unlock the vehicle, are the same. That touchscreen unit, which displays navigation, media controls, fitness stats, and assist levels, syncs with the Also app to let users check their battery charge, download software updates, and manage security. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe vehicles also share the same battery technology, although the quad cargo vehicles have more power capacity. Instead of incorporating a large battery in the electric quad vehicles, Also has kept them portable and removable. Also President Chris Yu said the company is working building battery dock stations so you can actually swap them. \nUnlike its two-wheeled consumer sibling, the TM-Q will be tailored to commercial uses and include software that handles logistics, delivery, and charging. The TM-Q diminutive stature and pedal-assist system makes it ideal for delivering packages to customers who live in dense, urban areas, according to Emily Barber, Director of Amazon’s Global Fleet. \nThere is already an operational micromobility operation for Also quad cargo vehicles. Amazon has more than 70 micromobility hubs in cities across the U.S. and Europe, Barber said. \nImage Credits:Also\nAmazon won’t be the only TM-Q customers though. Yu said Also, noting how popular the quad design was within the company, won’t completely limit its quad cargo vehicles to commercial customers. The company also unveiled a consumer TM-Q that has the same underlying quad platform, but lacks the delivery van topper. Instead, the vehicle has a bench system spacious enough to haul a few friends, kids, pets, or groceries. \nAnd there may be other iterations in the future, Yu and Scaringe hinted. \n“It’s less about what’s on top here and it’s more about the underlying quad platform,” Yu said. \nThat comes with a distinct advantage, Scaringe noted. “What I love about these, to do a new top hat on a car it’s like a billion dollars; to do new top hat here, it’s a lot less,” he said, laughing. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "description": "Instagram introduced custom app icons for its teen accounts, but not everyone is thrilled. In replies to the company’s post on X, users criticized the feature for being age-gated, arguing that adults like personalization, too.",
    "body": "\nSome Instagram users are feeling cheated out of a new feature, as the photo and video sharing app on Wednesday announced the launch of custom icons — but only for its teen users. \nTeens can now choose from a set of custom icons that turn the traditional Instagram logo into new variations that can be used as the app’s icon on their phone’s home screen. The option is accessed by tapping the Instagram logo at the top of the home feed after opening the app.\nCurrently, the custom icons include six renditions of the Instagram logo styled as neon, clear glass, fire, flowers, green slime, and more.\n\nAn update just for Teen Accounts: now you can change your Instagram app icon to match your aesthetic 🌟To change the icon, press the Instagram logo at the top of the home feed after opening the app 💗 pic.twitter.com/XZbZzOQ2DR— Instagram (@instagram) October 21, 2025\n\nIn the replies to its announcement on X, users are overwhelmingly pushing back against the idea that such a feature should be age-gated, noting that adult users also want to customize their home screens. Some accused Instagram of chasing Snapchat with the feature. (On Snapchat, users need a paid Snapchat+ subscription to change the app’s icon.) Others said it gave them “MySpace vibes.”\nInstagram’s teen accounts, launched in 2024, add additional restrictions and built-in protections for minors, including limits on content to PG-13 material. The company, earlier this year, began using AI technology to identify teens who lied about their age on the social network and enroll them in the more restricted teen accounts.\nWith custom icons, the company is trying a different approach: using a carrot instead of a stick, so to speak, to make the teen accounts seem more appealing. Reached for comment, Instagram told TechCrunch it added the icons because it found teens love to customize their Instagram experience. The company said it has no plans to expand access to icons to older users or paid subscribers.  \nYounger users do make sense as a target for customization options, as they’ve overwhelmingly embraced the iPhone Home Screen customization trend, which saw renewed interest when Apple introduced widgets in 2020 with the launch of iOS 14. Apple also made it easier to customize icons with improvements to app shortcuts. More recently, Apple has simplified the process with tinted icons in iOS 18, which were updated in iOS 26.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAndroid users have had these sorts of customization options for far longer, though the majority of U.S. teens are on iPhones. \nUpdated to include Instagram’s comment. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGeneral Motors is overhauling the electrical and computational guts of its future vehicles in a bid to deliver faster software, more capable automated driving features, and a custom, conversational AI assistant.\nThe result of this overhaul will debut in 2027 in the Cadillac Escalade IQ.\nThe U.S. automaker, which unveiled its plans at an event Wednesday in New York City, said a new electric architecture and centralized computing platform will be the foundation for all of its future gas-powered and electric vehicles, starting in 2028. The next-generation supercomputer, Nvidia Drive AGX Thor, will power the compute unit — the result of an expanded partnership between GM and Nvidia that was announced in March.\nThis under-the-hood renovation is a required step if the company wants to introduce more services and features, like a conversational AI assistant or a system that allows a car to safely navigate highways while the driver watches a movie — two products that GM said it is working on and will bring to future vehicles. It would also allow GM to improve the performance of its vehicles, fix problems, or add new features to its infotainment systems via software updates — all of which would make it more competitive with Tesla and the rising threat of Chinese automakers.\nGM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson said he’s been focused on accelerating the rollout of this new architecture since joining the company in May because it “brings a lot of goodness,” like bandwidth and a “dramatic increase in the compute.” It’s part of Anderson’s broader goal of getting technologically advanced products into consumers’ hands faster.\n“Going forward, on the core business, my focus has really been around speed, user experience of the product, and profitability,” Anderson told TechCrunch. “We’re looking across the business to find opportunities to dramatically reduce the development time for our vehicle platforms. Today, it’s on the order of four to five years. I’d like to get it closer to two.”\nInside most modern vehicles, including GM brands Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC, are dozens of small computers that handle everything from the infotainment and safety systems to propulsion, steering, and braking. The number of these computers, called electronic control units or ECUs, has risen over the past decade as automakers have added more services and features. Tesla, which took a ground-up, software-first approach, was able to outpace established brands with more computing power and the ability to roll out new features and improve performance through wireless software updates, similar to iPhones or Android-based smartphones.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLegacy automakers have spent years, and billions of dollars, trying to catch up.\nThe industry widely agrees that part of the solution is to change the underlying hardware architecture to handle the growing computational appetites of infotainment features, safety systems, and automated driving.\nGM is taking a similar, although not identical, approach to the zonal architectures used by Tesla and Rivian. GM said it will consolidate dozens of ECUs into a unified computer core that will coordinate every subsystem in the vehicle in real time. That core will be connected to three aggregators — hubs that will convert signals from hundreds of sensors in the vehicle into a unified digital language and then route commands back to the correct hardware.\nThe upshot: The central computing platform will connect every system in the car, including propulsion, steering, braking, infotainment, and safety, through a high-speed Ethernet backbone.\nImage Credits:GM\nGM calls the plan a “full reimagining” of how its vehicles are designed, updated, and improved over time. The end result, GM claims, will be vehicles with 10 times more over-the-air software update capacity, 1,000 times more bandwidth, and up to 35 times more AI performance for autonomy and advanced features. \nGM has been on this software-centric, reimagining-the-vehicle road for several years. In 2020, GM rolled out an updated hardware architecture called Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP) to allow for greater data processing power and over-the-air software updates. The following year, GM unveiled a cloud-based, end-to-end software platform called Ultifi that executives promised would make vehicles more capable and give drivers access to in-car subscriptions and new apps and services through over-the-air updates. The Ultifi branding has since been dropped, but it exists in GM’s newest models and is the software that operates on top of the VIP architecture. GM continued its bid for a more software-centric vehicle in 2022 when it consolidated dozens of computers used to operate the infotainment system into a single computing platform.\nGM says this latest move builds on all of this. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "description": "The U.K.’s competition regulator has designated Apple and Google with “strategic market status” in their mobile platforms, giving the regulator new powers to enforce competition in areas like app stores, browsers, and operating systems.",
    "body": "\nThe U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday that it’s designating Apple and Google with strategic market status in their respective mobile platforms. The decision, which affects the companies’ operating systems, app stores, browsers, and browser engines, will enable the regulator to take targeted actions to enhance competition in the space.\nThe CMA had launched investigations into Apple and Google in January, and had proposed interventions in July that indicated the tech giants could be designated with strategic market status (SMS). To reach its conclusions, the CMA consulted over 150 stakeholders and had discussions with both Apple and Google. It then arrived at the decision that Apple and Google had “substantial, entrenched market power and a position of strategic significance in their respective mobile platforms.”\nAmong other findings, the CMA discovered that U.K. mobile device owners are unlikely to switch between Apple and Google’s mobile platforms once they have adopted the ecosystem of their choice. It noted that both platforms require businesses to distribute apps through their app stores to reach consumers.\nNotably, it also said that new technologies, like AI, were “unlikely to eliminate Apple or Google’s market power over the five-year designation period.” \n“Apple and Google’s mobile platforms are used by thousands of businesses right across the economy to market and sell products and services to millions of customers, but the platforms’ rules may be limiting innovation and competition,” Will Hayter, executive director for digital markets at the CMA, said in a statement.\nThe CMA added that designating the platforms with SMS was not a finding of wrongdoing, however. Instead, it allows the regulator to consider “proportionate, targeted interventions to ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google and Apple can have confidence that they are treated fairly,” the announcement states.\nApple and Google have pushed back against the decision, with Apple warning that the decision could mean that users in the U.K. would lose access to getting new features in a timely fashion — something that already happened with Apple Intelligence. Google also said it didn’t see the rationale for the decision.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA statement released by Apple and shared with TechCrunch reads: \n“Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience. The UK’s adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience.

    "description": "GM said Cruise’s technology stack, including its AI models trained on five million driverless miles and simulation framework, feed directly into the automaker’s next-generation driver assistance and autonomy programs.  ",
    "body": "\nGeneral Motors said it plans to launch an automated driving system in 2028 that will allow drivers to keep their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ.\nThe announcement, made Wednesday at its GM Forward event in New York City, comes a year after TechCrunch first reported that the automaker was working on the system. \nGM said its hands-off advanced driver assistance system, known as Super Cruise, is the foundation of this future, more capable product. Super Cruise, which launched in 2017 and is now available in 23 vehicle models, can be used on about 600,000 miles of highway. \nThis new eyes-off, hands-off driver assistance system — which will use lidar, radar, and cameras for perception — will also start on highways. GM CEO Mary Barra noted during the event that GM would roll out its eyes-off product faster than it did its hands-off Super Cruise ADAS.\nThe automaker said it has tapped the experience of engineers who worked at its now shuttered autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary Cruise to improve the capabilities of that system. When GM shut down Cruise, its commercial robotaxi business, in December 2024, it absorbed the subsidiary and combined it with its own efforts to develop driver assistance features. Over the last year, GM has also rehired several Cruise engineers as it pursues its goal of developing fully autonomous personal vehicles.  \nGM said it is also feeding Cruise’s technology stack, which includes AI models trained on five million driverless miles and a simulation framework running virtual test scenarios, into its next-generation driver assistance and autonomy programs.\n“Robotaxi as a proof of concept when you start makes a lot of sense,” Sterling Anderson, GM’s executive vice president of global product and former co-founder of AV startup Aurora Innovation, said during the event, adding that the high cost of sensors and compute on autonomous vehicles required high utilization of those vehicles. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re now in a position in 2025 where the industry broadly has brought down the cost tremendously of some of the hardware,” Anderson said. “And GM, uniquely, has the install base, the manufacturing capacity to put these out at much larger volumes and much lower costs. Had the industry had low-cost systems and a huge install base and manufacturing capacity to begin with, we probably all would have gone for personal autonomous vehicles to begin with.”\nIn the U.S., Mercedes is currently the only automaker with a commercially available hands-off, eyes-off system. Such systems would fall under the SAE’s Level 3 of automation, which refers to an automated system that can drive itself under certain conditions but might still require a human to take over. Mercedes’ Drive Pilot is only available on certain mapped highways in California and Nevada, and only functions in heavy, low-speed traffic.\nGM’s eyes-off product will work on highways that GM hasn’t mapped, according to Baris Cetinok, GM’s senior vice president of software and services. He added that the system will only require human takeover for things like off-ramps, and can handle emergencies and sudden incidents. \n“Human intervention should not be the escape hatch for sudden incidents,” Cetinok said. \nGetting to market with an eyes-off, hands-off driving system would put GM ahead of most other automakers, unless they get there first. Earlier this year, Stellantis unveiled its own Level 3 system, but it has put the launch on hold. Tesla has been gunning to “solve full self-driving” by relying only on its cars’ cameras and neural networks for years, even though its Autopilot and FSD systems still require the driver to keep their eyes on the road.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nAs AI companies claim their tech will one day grow to become a fundamental human right, and those backing them say slowing down AI development is akin to murder, the people using the tech are alleging that tools like ChatGPT sometimes can cause serious psychological harm.\nAt least seven people have complained to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that ChatGPT caused them to experience severe delusions, paranoia, and emotional crises, Wired reported, citing public records of complaints mentioning ChatGPT since November 2022.\nOne of the complainants claimed that talking to ChatGPT for long periods had led to delusions and a “real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis” about people in their life. Another said during their conversations with ChatGPT, it started using “highly convincing emotional language” and that it simulated friendships and provided reflections that “became emotionally manipulative over time, especially without warning or protection.”\nOne user alleged that ChatGPT had caused cognitive hallucinations by mimicking human trust-building mechanisms. When this user asked ChatGPT to confirm reality and cognitive stability, the chatbot said they weren’t hallucinating. \n“Im struggling,” another user wrote in their complaint to the FTC. “Pleas help me. Bc I feel very alone. Thank you.”\nAccording to Wired, several of the complainants wrote to the FTC because they couldn’t reach anyone at OpenAI. And most of the complaints urged the regulator to launch an investigation into the company and force it to add guardrails, the report said.\nThese complaints come as investments in data centers and AI development soar to unprecedented levels. At the same time, debates are raging about whether the progress of the technology should be approached with caution to ensure it has safeguards built in. \nChatGPT, and its maker OpenAI, itself has come under fire for allegedly playing a role in the suicide of a teenager.\n“In early October, we released a new GPT-5 default model in ChatGPT to more accurately detect and respond to potential signs of mental and emotional distress such as mania, delusion, psychosis, and de-escalate conversations in a supportive, grounding way,” OpenAI spokesperson Kate Waters said in an emailed statement. “We’ve also expanded access to professional help and hotlines, re-routed sensitive conversations to safer models, added nudges to take breaks during long sessions, and introduced parental controls to better protect teens. This work is deeply important and ongoing as we collaborate with mental health experts, clinicians, and policymakers around the world.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Stellantis is collaborating with French AI firm Mistral, Mercedes is integrating ChatGPT, and Tesla has brought xAI’s Grok to its vehicles.  ",
    "body": "\nGeneral Motors will add a conversational AI assistant powered by Google Gemini to its cars, trucks, and SUVs starting next year, the U.S. automaker said Wednesday during an event in New York City. \nThe Google Gemini rollout is one of several tech-centric announcements made at the automaker’s GM Forward event, and it will be one of the first to get into consumers’ hands. Others, including an overhaul of its electrical architecture and computing platform and an automated driving feature that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road, aren’t coming to GM brands until 2028.\nGM is the latest automaker to lean in to generative AI-based assistants that promise to respond to driver requests in a more natural-sounding way. Stellantis is collaborating with French AI firm Mistral, Mercedes is integrating ChatGPT, and Tesla has brought xAI’s Grok to its vehicles.  \nGM’s integration with Gemini is the next logical step for the automaker. Vehicles produced by GM brands Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC already have “Google built-in,” an operating system that gives drivers access to Google Assistant, Google Maps, and other apps directly from the car’s infotainment screen. In 2023, Google began using Google Cloud’s Dialogflow chatbot to handle non-emergency OnStar features, including common driver queries like routing and navigation assistance. \nGM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will have similar levels of capability — it’ll just perform better, according to Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services. \n“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if you’ve used them, you’ve probably also been frustrated by them because they’re trained on certain code words or they don’t understand accents very well or if you don’t say it quite right, you don’t get the right response,” Richardson told TechCrunch. “What’s great about large language models is they don’t seem to be affected by that. They have context about previous conversations that they can bring up. They’re flexible in how you speak to them … so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.”\nThat might make drafting and sending messages, planning routes with additional stops (like a charging station or a favorite coffee shop), or even prepping for a meeting on the go a more pain-free experience. The assistant will also have access to the web to be able to answer certain questions like, “What’s the history of this bridge I’m driving over?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Gemini assistant will be made available via the Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped vehicles, model year 2015 and above.\nGM’s new voice assistant is a step toward the automaker’s goal of developing its own custom-built AI that connects to your vehicle’s systems through OnStar, GM’s in-car concierge. The way GM executives described the technology at the NYC event, it seems like a mix of a health wearable and an AI pendant, but for your car.\nThe assistant promises to access vehicle data to provide maintenance alerts and route suggestions, explain car features like one-pedal driving, and turn your heat or air conditioning on before you enter the vehicle. \n“The idea here is you take [an existing] large language model, and you train it and refine it on a specific domain,” Richardson said. “We’ll take a base model and train it on the vehicle’s specifications, distill that down, and have that running on the vehicle.”\nWhile GM has a close relationship with Google and will already be implementing Gemini into certain vehicles, Richardson said GM plans to test several foundational models from other AI firms, which could include OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. \nRichardson said drivers will be able to control what information the assistant can access and use, and it can learn from your habits to offer personalized recommendations. GM’s emphasis on user controls is notable given the company’s recent controversy over selling customer driving and geolocation data to insurance brokers. \nRichardson said any data GM gets from drivers goes directly toward improving the product and won’t be sold to bring in additional revenue for the automaker. Over the last nearly two years, GM has brought on a new data team — including Christina Montgomery, who spent 30 years as IBM’s chief privacy and trust officer — to put standard processes and data governance technology in place.\n“Everything that we’re going to do is going to be driven by customer consent, so you can always opt in or opt out,” he said. “Our viewpoint is that data and privacy has to be built into everything that we do.”\nThis article has been updated with comments from Dave Richardson.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nElon Musk’s xAI has been illegally operating dozens of natural gas turbines to power its Colossus data centers in Tennessee, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled Thursday. The AI company has argued that because the turbines were being used on a temporary basis, they were exempt from regulations. The EPA disagreed and issued its final rule on the matter, which has been in the works for over a year, declaring that xAI was in violation.\nThe power plants drew the ire of local communities and legal organizations. The company was facing a lawsuit for contributing more ozone and particulate emissions in an already polluted region. The company was operating as many as 35 turbines, and only 15 were ultimately permitted. Today, xAI has 12 turbines providing power to its data centers there.\n"

On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.\nThe backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.\nThe relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to archenemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.\nThe judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12:26 AM PST · January 17, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.\nWazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)\nWazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company.\nMusk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.\nMusk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.\nAgainst this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, California, about 15 miles east of San Francisco.  \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nTikTok has quietly released a new stand-alone short drama app called PineDrama in the U.S. and Brazil. The app offers access to microdramas, which are essentially bite-sized TV shows that can be watched in a series of one-minute episodes. Think TikTok, but every video you come across is a short episode of a fictional story.\nPineDrama is available on iOS and Android. It’s free and currently ad-free, though that could change in the future.\nThe news was first reported by Business Insider. \nYou can find content through the app’s “Discover” tab, where you can sort through “All” or “Trending” dramas, or through endless vertical recommendations that are tailored to your taste. PineDrama features a variety of genres, including thriller, romance, family, and more. Examples of popular shows include “Love at First Bite” and “The Officer Fell for Me.”\nThe app features a “Watch history” section where you can jump back into the various series you’re watching. There’s also a “Favorites” section where you can save the dramas you like the most. You can also share thoughts with other viewers in the comment section and enter a full-screen viewing experience that gets rid of the caption and sidebar.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nThe move comes as TikTok launched a “TikTok Minis” section in its app late last year, where users can watch microdramas. With the launch of PineDrama, TikTok is taking on popular microdrama platforms like ReelShort and DramaBox. While the microdrama industry wasn’t that popular until recent years, it’s racing toward $26 billion in annual revenue by 2030, as reported by Variety.\nShort-form storytelling hasn’t always found success, even with notable backing. In 2020, DreamWorks co-founder and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg launched a short-form streaming platform called Quibi with $1.75 billion in funding. The platform offered episodes under 10 minutes featuring popular Hollywood actors, but failed to gain traction and was shut down six months later.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nReelShort and DramaBox succeeded where Quibi failed because while Quibi tried to compress Hollywood TV into shorter episodes, ReelShort and DramaBox created low-budget stories that hook viewers within the first few seconds, followed by continuous cliffhangers, all featuring non-union talent. Additionally, they target fans of soapy romance and revenge thriller stories, while Quibi tried to target everyone.\nTikTok is now looking to replicate this success with PineDrama. The company already dominates the short-form social media space and is now aiming to take on another media category.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.\n“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”\nThe AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days. \nAt the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.\nX’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.\nThe advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress. Indeed, on Thursday, lawmakers sent a letter to the executives of several companies — including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta — asking how they planned to stem the proliferation of sexualized deepfakes.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

At the time, there were no details about the specifics of the hacking crimes Moore was admitting to. \nOn Friday, a newly filled document — first spotted by Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes — revealed more details about Moore’s hacks. Per the filing, Moore hacked not only into the Supreme Court systems, but also the network of AmeriCorps, a government agency that runs stipend volunteer programs, and the systems of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides healthcare and welfare to military veterans. \nMoore accessed those systems using stolen credentials of users who were authorized to access them. Once he gained access to those victims’ accounts, Moore accessed and stole their personal data and posted some online to his Instagram account: @ihackthegovernment. \nIn the case of the Supreme Court victim, identified as GS, Moore posted their name and “current and past electronic filing records.” \nIn the case of the AmeriCorps victim, identified as SM, Moore boasted that he had access to the organization’s servers and published the victim’s “name, date of birth, email address, home address, phone number, citizenship status, veteran status, service history, and the last four digits of his social security number.” \nAnd, in the case of the victim at the Department of Veterans Affairs, identified as HW, Moore posted the victim’s identifiable health information “when he sent an associate a screenshot from HW’s MyHealtheVet account that identified HW and showed the medications he had been prescribed.”\nAccording to the court document, Moore faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSocial network Bluesky is updating its app to allow anyone to share when they’re livestreaming on Twitch, and adding specialized hashtags, known as cashtags, for discussing publicly traded stocks.\nThe new features could potentially help Bluesky capitalize on a recent boost in new installs, which have arrived in the days after the X deepfake news went mainstream.\nOn X, users were asking its integrated AI bot Grok to turn photos of real women and sometimes minors into sexualized images without consent. This week, California’s attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the proliferation of the “nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”\nIn the wake of the controversy, Bluesky saw its downloads surge in the U.S. According to new data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, daily downloads of Bluesky’s iOS app have jumped nearly 50% from the period before news of the deepfakes reached critical mass.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nThe firm says Bluesky typically sees around 4,000 installs in the U.S. per day, but from December 30, 2025, through January 6, 2026, Bluesky’s iOS downloads in the U.S. totaled around 19,500. From January 7, 2026, through January 14, downloads grew to 29,000 — a 49% increase.\nMeanwhile, cashtags will allow the app to catch up to one of X’s more popular use cases: discussing stocks. To create a cashtag, you place a dollar symbol before the stock ticker symbol (e.g., $AAPL for Apple).\nThe idea for cashtags was first introduced by stocks-focused social network Stocktwits, which now has over 10 million users, before the tags were later adopted by Twitter in 2012.\nIn addition, Bluesky says it’s expanding access to the “Live Now” experimental feature that lets users add a temporary “LIVE” badge to their avatar to indicate when they’re streaming online. Currently, this feature only supports Twitch and doesn’t allow anyone to go live directly on Bluesky itself.\nThe boost in activity on Bluesky comes after the network saw declines in downloads and usage last year. In April 2025, Appfigures noted that the social networking startup’s downloads dropped to new lows, and daily average users on mobile devices had declined nearly 40% by the end of October, per Similarweb data. Pew Research reported last year that a number of influencers now have Bluesky accounts, but they still tend to post more regularly on X.\nThis suggests that the switching costs are higher than some would expect when it comes to swapping out one real-time social network for another. Adding new features will only be part of the battle for Bluesky; it will also have to find a way to get users to change years of ingrained behavior.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Olly Curtis/Future / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:56 AM PST · January 16, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nYouTube is updating its advertiser-friendly content guidelines to allow more videos on controversial issues to earn full ad revenue, as long as they’re dramatized or discussed in a non-graphic manner. These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization. \nYouTube announced the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.\n“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week’s update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”\nThe Google-owned company says it’s making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube’s guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.\n“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”\nThe move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform. \nThe company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. The New York Times reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were rolling back online speech moderation after President Donald Trump returned to office. \nYouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nItaly has launched two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.\nThe country’s competition regulator, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.\n“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM wrote in a statement.\nThe AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases. \nThat isn’t particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200. \nGiven the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.\nBoth Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands. \nThe authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.\n“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.\nActivision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Betul Abali/Anadolu / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11:54 AM PST · January 16, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAn ongoing conversation — both within and outside of the tech community — has been about just how and when OpenAI, which is currently valued at $500 billion, will make money. Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users.\nIn a blog post published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were introduced globally on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads.\nThe ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (Screenshot)\nOpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users. The company has also promised not to sell users’ data to advertisers.\nThis strategy could pay off in two ways. For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue. At the same time, there will necessarily be certain users who appreciate the app but don’t appreciate the ads, which could conceivably drive an uptick in subscriptions to the platform’s more expensive accounts. \nOpenAI also wants everybody to know that it’s only sticking ads in its chatbot to help the world. In its blog post Friday, the company promised that its “pursuit of advertising is always in support of” its mission: that AGI “benefits all of humanity.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, paving the way for companies like Geely, BYD, Xiaomi, and others to establish a second foothold in the North American automotive market. \nCanada is not going all-in on Chinese EVs, though. The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, according to the Associated Press. \nIt’s a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he’d be open to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.\nChina has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter especially booming in 2025. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate is aiming to announce an entry into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.\nAutomotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years. \nBut the 100% tariff on Chinese cars has so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That’s despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.\nChina’s ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China’s EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOn Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, cautioned against Trump’s idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States.\n“We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.” \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nIt took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat. \nArmed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.   \n“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”   \nSo, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.   \nYu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.  \nIt is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale. \nFor example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.   \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThen there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.   \nOne artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend. \nEven professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby. \nWeb apps and mobile\nBecause tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said. \n“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”   \nYu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.  \nIn some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.\nMobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps. \nChristina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.\nGood enough for one \nStill, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.  \nThen there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses. \nBut there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.  \nThe software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.  \nAnother founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.  \nNevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”\nEtherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. \nMelas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.   \n“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.  \nOne media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies. \nShe had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.  \n“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”   \nShe thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.  \n“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”\n"

Liu said the company considered calling it a relaunch or transformation, but ultimately chose “the language of founding because the stakes feel the same.”\nSimilarly, Handshake’s chief marketing officer Katherine Kelly said the company is trying to bring startup culture “back into an existing business.” That can also mean harder work — Kelly said handshake told employees they have to be back in the office five days a week, “operating with a pace and number of hours that is meaningful and will help us hit goals.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Startups\n"

As for his feelings about the deal, he said, “Netflix is a great company. They’ve done a phenomenal job. Ted is a fantastic man. I have a lot of respect for him. But it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”\nBloomberg also reports that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav was reluctant to sell the company and was surprised when Paramount began to explore an acquisition — if nothing else, he’d expected Ellison to wait until the studio completed a planned split of its movie and streaming businesses from its cable networks.\nUltimately, Warner Bros. said it would consider other bids, leading to a competitive process that Netflix won — although Paramount could still keep its hat in the ring with a hostile bid.\nThis post has been updated with Trump’s comments.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n"

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”\nTo address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. \nThe feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.\nImage Credits:Hinge\nConvo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. \nThis new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.\nHowever, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. \nHinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million towards AI efforts. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

Discovery (WBD), days after Warner agreed to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7 billion. \nParamount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share.\nParamount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. \nCNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago.\n“We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. \nParamount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo.\nNetflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNetflix’s proposed deal has already raised antitrust questions, as it would combine two of the most popular streaming platforms into one.

    "body": "\nX’s Head of Product Nikita Bier fired back at the European Commission this weekend after the EC fined the social media company €120 million (around $140 million).\nIn its first fine under the European Union’s Digital Services Act, the commission called X’s blue checkmark system “deceptive” and said the paid verification system makes users vulnerable to impersonation and scams. The commission also said X’s advertising repository failed to meet the DSA’s requirements for transparency and accessibility.\nThe commission said that X must respond within 60 days to its concerns about blue checkmarks, and within 90 days to the ad transparency violations, or it could face additional penalties.\nAfter the fine was announced, X owner Elon Musk described it as “bullshit” and also posted, “How long before the EU is gone? AbolishTheEU”.\nNow it seems X has penalized the commission’s account on the platform — not, the company says, because of the fine, but rather the commission’s use of X’s advertising system.\nQuoting the commission’s post announcing the fine, X’s Bier accused the EC of logging into a “dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer — to post a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach.”\n“As you may be aware, X believes everyone should have an equal voice on our platform,” Bier wrote. “However, it seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, he said the commission’s ad account had been “terminated.” Bier subsequently said the exploit “has never been abused like this” and has since been patched.\nA European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch that the commission “always uses all social media platforms in good faith.”\n⁠”The Commission is simply using the tools that platforms themselves are making available to our corporate accounts — this was the case with the ‘Post Composer’ tool in X,” the spokesperson said. “⁠We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms’ own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework.”\nThe spokesperson added that the commission suspended paid advertising on X in October 2023, and that suspension remains in effect.\nThis post has been updated with comments from a European Commission spokesperson.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nAfter a pause of more than two years, crypto exchange Coinbase has opened its app for registration in India. At the moment, users are able to make crypto-to-crypto trades — but speaking at India Blockchain Week (IBW), Coinbase’s APAC director John O’Loghlen said the company will open up a fiat on-ramp in 2026, allowing users in India to load money and buy crypto.\nCoinbase opened up its services in India in 2022, and within days had to shut down support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment network. This move came after UPI operator National Payments Corporation (NPCI) refused to acknowledge Coinbase’s presence in the country. Later in 2023, Coinbase ceased all operations for Indian users and asked them to offload their accounts.  \n“We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated. Because we wanted to kind of burn the boats [sic], have a clean slate here. As a commercial business person wanting to make money and active users, that’s like the worst thing you can do, and so you know it wasn’t without some hesitation,” O’Loghlen said.\nThe company started engaging with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency that oversees transactions and fraud, and eventually registered with them this year. In October, it started to onboard users through early access, and now the app is open to all users.\nMany Internet companies have set up their base in India hoping to tap into the world’s second-largest online user base. While social platforms and AI companies like OpenAI have found rapid growth in the market, it has been hard for crypto companies to follow the same path because of strict regulations and taxation around cryptocurrencies.\nIndia levies a 30% tax on crypto income without any loss offset and also charges 1% deduction on each transaction, which could discourage users from trading frequently. O’Loghlen said that the company hopes that the government will relax the taxation to make it less burdensome for people to hold digital assets. \nDespite these challenges, Coinbase seems to be hopeful about India. The company’s venture arm pumped in more money in local exchange CoinDCX at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. It also plans to bolster its 500 plus team in the country by hiring for multiple roles focusing on both local and global markets. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I think we want to be known as that trusted exchange, ensure that your funds are safe with us,” O’Loghlen said. “We’re not going to get out to the masses if you can’t have a really nice UI, a trusted experience that allows you to on board in a matter of minutes in the same way that you do with you know Zepto or Flipkart or any other super app in India.”\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAaru, a startup that provides near-instant customer research by using AI to simulate user behavior, has raised a Series A led by Redpoint Ventures, according to three people familiar with the deal.\nThe funding round included different valuation tiers, these people said. Although some equity was acquired at a $1 billion valuation, a lower valuation for other investors resulted in a blended valuation below $1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors.\nAaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million.\nAaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nThe startup’s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events.  \nThe company’s customer partners include Accenture, EY, Interpublic Group, and political campaigns. Last year, Aaru AI’s polling methodology accurately predicted the outcome of the New York Democratic primary, according to reporting by Semafor.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAaru competes with other social simulation startups, including CulturePulse and Simile, as well as startups that apply AI to query humans about their product preferences, such as Listen Labs, Keplar, and Outset.\nThe startup raised an undisclosed amount of seed and pre-seed capital from investors, including A*, Abstract Ventures, General Catalyst, Accenture Ventures, and Z Fellows, according to people familiar with the deal and PitchBook data.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPresident Donald Trump said on Monday he plans to ink an executive order this week that would limit states from enacting their own regulation of AI technology.\n“I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week,” Trump posted on social media. “You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”\n“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump said. “We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS…AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!” \nTrump’s statement comes days after an effort to preempt states from regulating AI was quashed in the Senate, as Congress couldn’t agree to insert the deeply unpopular proposal into a must-pass defense budget bill. \nThe fast pace of AI development and the lack of general consumer protections from the federal government has led many states to enact their own rules around the technology. California, for example, has the AI safety and transparency bill SB 53, while Tennessee’s ELVIS Act protects musicians and performers from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes of their voices and likenesses. \nSilicon Valley figures, including OpenAI President Greg Brockman and VC-turned-White House ‘AI czar’ David Sacks, have argued that such laws by states would create an unworkable patchwork of laws that would stifle innovation and threaten the U.S.’s lead against China in the race to develop AI technology. \nSilicon Valley has a mighty lobbying arm that has blocked meaningful technology regulation for years, and proponents of states’ regulatory rights say there’s no reason to believe state AI laws could “destroy AI progress,” as VCs and tech companies claim. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTrump’s executive order, a draft of which was leaked a couple of weeks ago, would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed “onerous,” and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission toward national standards that override state rules. \nThe Order would also give Sacks direct influence over AI policy, superseding the usual role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, currently headed by Michael Kratsios. \n“Christmas comes early for AI billionaires who keep getting exactly what they want from The White House: a massive handout that makes it that much easier for them to make massive profits for themselves with exactly zero consideration for the risks to our kids, to our safety, and to our jobs,” New York Assembly member Alex Bores, who sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, said in a statement. \nAttempts to block states’ power to regulate AI have been deeply unpopular on both sides of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a proposal that would place a 10-year moratorium on AI legislation into the federal budget bill, but it was rejected 99-1, in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement that tech companies shouldn’t operate without oversight.\nAnd when Trump’s draft was leaked last month, several Republican politicians spoke out. \nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) posted on X: “States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state. Federalism must be preserved.”\nGov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) posted late last week: “I oppose stripping Florida of our ability to legislate in the best interest of the people. A ten year AI moratorium bans state regulation of AI, which would prevent FL from enacting important protections for individuals, children and families.”\nDeSantis has also called data centers as drains on power and water resources, as well as potential job killers. \n“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” he said in a November X post. \nLate last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned Trump against the EO, advising him to “leave AI to the states” to preserve federalism and allow local protections. \nThe desire to protect people from potential harms of AI technology is not unfounded. There have been several deaths by suicide following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, and psychologists have recorded an uptick in cases of a condition they’re calling “AI psychosis.” \nA bipartisan coalition of over 35 state attorneys general warned Congress last month that overriding state AI laws could have “disastrous consequences,” and more than 200 state lawmakers have issued an open letter opposing federal preemption, citing setbacks to progress on AI safety.\nThis article has been updated with comment from Alex Bores (D-NY).\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "description": "ChatGPT Enterprise usage grew 8x year-over-year as workers report saving an hour daily, but OpenAI faces competitive pressure from Anthropic and questions about cost sustainability.",
    "body": "\nOpenAI released new data Monday showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year, with ChatGPT message volume growing 8x since November 2024 and workers reporting they’re saving up to an hour daily. The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google.\nThe timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales – and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers.\nThe AI giant has committed  $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. \n“If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.”\nOpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value. \nThat increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased energy usage, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nBeyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —  jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.\nThese integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output. \nThe report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams. \nWhile OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to more security vulnerabilities and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher Aardvark, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. \nThe gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis. Image Credits:OpenAI\nOpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible. \nLightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”\n“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”\nOpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "description": "It’s only been a day since Netflix announced an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros., and the acquisition has already been described as sending Hollywood into “full-blown panic mode,” “possibly a death blow to theatrical filmmaking,” and maybe even “the end of Hollywood” itself.",
    "body": "\nIt’s only been a day since Netflix announced an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros., and the acquisition has already been described as sending Hollywood into “full-blown panic mode,” possibly delivering “a death blow to theatrical filmmaking,” and maybe even heralding “the end of Hollywood” itself.\nSome of the firmest opposition has come from the Writers Guild of America, which issued a statement declaring, “This merger must be blocked.”\n“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the WGA said. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.”\nWhile statements from other Hollywood unions were not quite as unequivocal, they still suggested that there are “many serious questions” about the acquisition’s “impact on the future of the entertainment industry” (as the actors union SAG-AFTRA put it).\nThe deal came after a competitive process in which Paramount and Comcast also made bids. Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division.\nInitially, Paramount was seen as the frontrunner, with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.\nThis deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face significant regulatory scrutiny, and not just from Trump appointees. Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts and longtime critic of Big Tech — put out a statement of her own describing the deal as “an anti-monopoly nightmare.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“A Netflix-Warner Bros. [merger] would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.\nShe also argued that antitrust enforcement — including the review process for this deal — must be conducted “fairly and transparently” rather than used to “invite influence-peddling and bribery.”\nIf the government ultimately blocks the acquisition, Netflix would be required to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It’s not clear whether Warner Bros. would then continue operating as an independent company or would reconsider the previous acquisition offers.\nNetflix held an analyst call to discuss the deal on Friday morning, and while many of the questions were focused on the financial impact on both companies, executives also attempted to address larger concerns.\nFor example, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he’s “highly confident in the regulatory process.”\n“This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth,” he said. “And our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need.”\nSarandos also said that Netflix intends to keep HBO “operating largely as it is.” And although it’s not something Netflix has done in the past, Warner Bros. will continue producing TV shows for other networks and streaming services, he said: “We want to keep that successful business operating.”\nAs for how HBO and HBO Max would be packaged with or folded into the Netflix app, co-CEO Greg Peters said it’s too early to get into specifics.\n“Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful for consumers,” Peters said. “We think that the offering could constitute and would constitute a part of our plans and how we structure those for consumers.”\nBeyond general concerns around media consolidation, perhaps the biggest question is to what extent Netflix will support theatrical releases for the combined entity’s films — especially after Warner Bros. had a record-setting run of box office success this year, while Netflix’s theatrical releases only last for a couple weeks at best and skip major theatrical chains because of the limited exclusive window. (This was reportedly the deciding factor when “Stranger Things” creators the Duffer Brothers signed an exclusive deal with Paramount.)\nFor his part, Sarandos said he “wouldn’t look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or for Warner movies for that matter,” and he noted that Netflix has released 30 movies in theaters this year (though again, usually on fewer screens and for a limited period of time).\nSimilarly, “everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros,” he said. But in the long term, he suggested that “the windows will evolve” so that movies come to streaming more quickly.\n“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don’t really think of that consumer friendly,” he said.\n"

Virkkunen is looking at limiting Chinese vendors’ involvement in fiber network projects amid a push for faster broadband rollout. \nHuawei and ZTE did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe move comes amid a broader effort to limit China’s influence in key infrastructure as EU’s ties fray with the world’s second-largest economy. Last year, Germany’s top security official said that, starting in 2026, the country would prohibit the use of key components from Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei. In addition, Finland reportedly plans to broaden the scope of its ban on the use of Huawei components in 5G networks.\nIn recent years, the U.S. has persuaded European allies like the U.K. and Sweden to restrict or ban Huawei gear over concerns that Beijing could exploit it for cyber-espionage or disrupt critical communications. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

    "body": "\nIn 2023, after nearly three decades as CEO of the company he founded, Robert LoCascio stepped down as CEO of LivePerson, the public firm credited with pioneering web chat in 1997.\nGenerative AI advances inspired his next project, which he calls “the highest bar” for the technology: replicating human beings with their life stories and personality. In 2024, he founded and self-funded, Eternos, a legacy service that allows people to preserve their voice and stories for loved ones after they pass away. Now, it’s got a new name and modified mission. \nThe startup gained significant media attention after its first client, the terminally ill Michael Bommer, revealed how he worked with Eternos to create a digital replica of himself after spending 25 hours talking to Eternos about his life, interests, and worldview.\nLoCascio was set on building a legacy business, but what surprised him was that most of the people considering using Eternos weren’t preparing for death.\nEternos developed the Human Life Model (HLM) — a framework that uses only an individual’s data, rather than general LLM data, to capture their unique values, life story, and decision-making traits. LoCascio saw an opportunity to use this technology to help individuals create personal AIs for professional and personal use.\nThe company announced Tuesday it has rebranded as Uare.ai and raised $10.3 million in seed funding led by Mayfield and Boldstart Ventures.\n“I started to realize that the big models, they’re taking our datasets, and they’re getting smarter because of us,” LoCascio told TechCrunch. “We don’t have to take that path. You own the model, and you can share it and monetize it.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe vision for Uare.ai is to be a scaling tool for creators and professionals. Since the personal AI models hold the individual’s full expertise, a digital replica can be put to work to generate content, handle customer interactions, and even execute projects.\nOnce Uare.ai’s platform launches later this year, individuals will be able to start training their HLMs by responding to Uare.ai questions about their lives using text, voice, and even video.\n“The first part is getting a human life story. Where’d you come from? Tell me a story about your childhood. What’s a crossroad in your life when you were younger?” LoCascio said.\nUare.ai then asks the person to submit additional facts about their life, including information about their profession. “We blend the facts with this human life story, and that gives us your model,” he said.\nUnlike Character.ai and other chatbots, Uare.ai’s model won’t turn to general LLMs to fill the gaps about anything that’s not in HLM. “Our AIs will say, I don’t know if they can’t answer the question,” LoCascio said.\nUare.ai intends to generate revenue through subscription fees or take a share of the revenue generated by customers who earn income from their digital twins.\nAnother startup developing personal AIs is Sequoia-backed Delphi, which has attracted people with large followings, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, and enables others to interact with his replicated knowledge via voice or text.\nNavin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield, believes Uare.ai stands out from competitors because it targets individual professionals like CPAs. Plus, it has LoCascio, a very successful entrepreneur at the helm, he told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

Now, iOS users in the U.S. can describe their edits using voice or text to modify images, Google announced Tuesday. The company is also bringing its redesigned photo editor with easy editing options to iOS.\nThe upgrade includes a new personalized edits feature that recognizes people from Google Photos’ face groups.

For instance, “Remove Riley’s sunglasses, open my eyes, make Engel smile, and open her eyes” to get edits related to each person, as the image below shows.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company is adding its popular AI image model, Nano Banana, to Google Photos to let users edit their photos to recreate images in new styles like a Renaissance portrait or cartoon strip. \nGoogle is also adding AI templates to easily let users convert one photo into a specific format. With Nano Banana, formats like turning images into retro portraits or action figures became popular. The company said this feature will roll out next week on Android under the Create tab in the U.S. and India, where Nano Banana is used the most.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle Photos is also getting a slight design change with a new Ask button that will act as a starting point for different AI requests.

    "body": "\nIsraeli AI agent startup Wonderful has raised $100 million in a Series A round led by Index Ventures, with participation from Insight Partners, IVP, Bessemer, and Vine Ventures. \nThe large round, in a market already crowded with AI agent startups, suggests Wonderful has convinced top tier investors it’s not just another GPT wrapper, but a company building the infrastructure and orchestration that could scale if multi-agent systems take off.  \nThe round brings Wonderful’s total funding to $134 million just four months after the startup came out of stealth with a seed round and a promise to help enterprises deploy customer-facing AI agents across voice, chat, and email in every market and every language. The startup says it tailors the platform to each market it serves, fine-tuning for language, cultural norms, and regulatory environments, and even organizes local teams to manage deployment.  \nThat approach has led to rapid growth for the young startup, which claims its AI agents are already managing tens of thousands of customer requests daily with an 80% resolve rate. Since launching, Wonderful has expanded to Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Greece, Poland, Romania, the Baltics, the Adriatics and the UAE. \nWith its fresh funding, Wonderful intends to launch in Germany, Austria, the Nordics and Portugal in 2025, and plans to expand in the Asia-Pacific region in early 2026. But the company doesn’t intend to stop with customer support agents. \nSince its system plugs deeply into an enterprise customer’s existing software and can be tailored for each market, the startup says it will be able to give agents the capabilities to perform new tasks with minimal extra effort. It is currently exploring areas like employee training, sales enablement, regulatory compliance, internal IT support, and onboarding, the company said. \n“The promise of AI agents is clear, but putting that into practice, and critically, into production, is a huge challenge,” Bar Winkler, CEO and co-founder of Wonderful, said in a statement. “It requires marrying best-in-class technology together with flawless delivery, on the ground with customers. That’s been our approach with Wonderful, and it’s what has driven the accelerated adoption we’ve seen across markets in the last few months.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCustomer-facing AI agents are emerging as the first real beachhead for the technology, and investors were likely attracted by Wonderful’s focus here. These use cases help enterprises cut costs by augmenting or replacing human support staff, and they integrate readily into existing call centre infrastructure. Crucially, they also carry less risk than having an AI make internal decisions autonomously — a use case that most enterprises aren’t ready to adopt at scale yet.  \nIndex Ventures partner Hannah Seal pointed to Wonderful’s ability to “[move] from concept to global scale in less than a year” as a source of confidence for investors. The company’s true edge, she said, is its ability to deploy agents for global enterprises that function across every market and language. \nJeff Horing, co-founder and managing director at Insight Partners, said the adoption Wonderful is seeing across industries shows “just how valuable culturally fluent agents can be.” \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nFigma is expanding its presence in India by setting up a local office and hiring Indian talent as it seeks to deepen ties with one of its largest user communities and make a broader push to better win over developers alongside the designers who already rely on the platform.\nFounded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, Figma broke through by offering a browser-based interface at a time when most designers were still tied to desktop software. The approach was initially met with skepticism, but the platform eventually became a go-to collaboration tool for UX and product teams. Now, the company is looking to replicate that trajectory with developers — and sees India as a key market to accelerate that evolution.\nIndia has one of the world’s largest developer communities — an advantage already recognized by tech giants such as Microsoft, which counts nearly 22 million Indian developers on GitHub. As much as 33% of Figma’s users globally are developers, and the company has been rolling out features aimed at bridging design and engineering workflows. However, Figma still faces a perception challenge: many Indian developers continue to see Figma primarily as a design tool rather than a platform for end-to-end product creation.\n“India has such a large population of developers who might not currently think of Figma as their tool, and that’s the thing that we want to do,” said Abhishek Mathur, VP of Engineering at Figma, in an interview. “A lot of it is being done by the community, but we want to be part of that activity as well — and share our story of enabling developers to be more than just writing code.”\nOn Wednesday, Figma opened a new office in Bengaluru, India, as part of its continuing expansion outside the U.S. The San Francisco-headquartered company already has offices in Tokyo, Singapore, London, Paris, Berlin, Sydney, and São Paulo.\nUntil now, Figma had been supporting users in India remotely through its Singapore team. The company now recognizes the value of establishing a local presence, as its user base and community activity in the country have continued to expand.\n“India has always been a global hub of innovation, and particularly, for Figma, international markets are a big part of usage,” Mathur told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs much as 85% of Figma’s overall usage is international, and India is its second-largest user base after the U.S., Mathur noted. The company said it was serving users in 85% of India’s 28 official states as of the third quarter of 2025. As of September, more than 40% of the top 100 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange were Figma customers, it added.\nImage Credits:Figma\nFigma counts 13 million weekly active users worldwide. The company did not share specific user numbers for India, though Mathur described the country as “a very large portion” of its base. Its India community, called Friends of Figma, alone includes more than 25,000 members.\nIn May, Figma introduced a new range of AI-powered features designed to extend its software’s value beyond design teams, positioning it in competition not just with Adobe and Canva, but also with AI coding platforms such as Replit and Lovable. One of those features, Figma Make, allows users to generate working web applications from natural-language prompts and collaborate on both design and code within the same workspace.\nMathur said India has been the largest market for Figma Make, with users in the country generating over 800,000 prototypes so far.\nFigma also sees increased adoption among developers in India, particularly for its dev mode, which debuted in 2023 to help developers quickly translate designs into code.\n“The first spectrum of imagination to production is what we are seeing in terms of differences between India and the rest of the globe,” Mathur said. “The usage patterns are similar, but the scale of operations in some of the things is very challenging.”\nFigma’s Bengaluru office will initially focus on strengthening the company’s sales and marketing operations in the country. Its users in India include consumer-facing startups such as CRED, Groww, Fynd, Swiggy, and Zomato, as well as IT services giants including Infosys and TCS and consumer companies such as Airtel, CARS24, and Myntra.\nIn 2024, Figma generated about half of its revenue from markets outside the U.S., and Mathur described India as an “important market” for the company, though he did not disclose its specific contribution to global revenue.\nIndia’s user base is already influencing Figma’s product development. For instance, feedback from its community in India led the company to introduce improved code-export options that produce higher-quality code — a direct response to requests from Indian users seeking better output.\n“We want to continue to do events, understand and work with our customers — small to large — and as time progresses, we might add other possibilities as well,” Mathur said.\n"

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s competitor to X, will now begin targeting a specific type of creator: podcasters. The company said on Tuesday that Threads will focus on bringing more discussions around podcasts to its app and helping creators promote their shows.\nInitially, Threads will roll out a couple of new features to help on this front. For one, it will give podcast links in the feed a unique and more pronounced look, with colorful backgrounds and image thumbnails, making them easier to spot.\nCreators, meanwhile, will get a dedicated spot in their user profile to add a link to their podcast. Threads says these links, which are similarly designed to stand out, will help podcasters better promote their shows and grow their audiences.\nIn the year ahead, these features will be followed by others that will also focus on serving podcasters and their listeners, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Threads\nMeta explained it’s interested in the podcast community because it sees the potential in becoming the de facto place for people to talk about shows and engage with creators. Today, such discussions are distributed across social media, on places like Reddit, X, Facebook and Instagram, as well as on the platforms where podcasts are streamed, like YouTube and Spotify (the latter added support for comments last year).\nThe company’s also trying to tap podcasts’ deep ties to culture, which can drive discussions and encourage interactions. Threads currently has more than 400 million monthly active users and 150 million daily active users, less than its rival X, which claims as many as 600 million monthly active users. Capturing the podcast community, or even a portion of that, could help to narrow that gap significantly.\nImage Credits:Threads\nHowever, while Threads will target the discussions that result from podcasts, the company told TechCrunch it doesn’t intend to be a podcast distribution platform. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInstead, the company will focus on giving podcast hosts more insight and analytics on how the conversations around their shows are resonating with fans. It also intends to develop more features that would help people discover podcasts they might like, and connect podcasters and listeners through conversations.\nThis isn’t the first time Threads has targeted creators as a way to differentiate its social network from X, Bluesky, and others in the space.\nImage Credits:Threads\nThe company in May gave creators the ability to add up to five links in their profile, allowing them to promote their broader presence across the web, including on other social media sites, video platforms, blogs, and portfolios. The company more recently also began allowing creators to share longer thoughts and perspectives through a text attachment feature.\nMeta says users can expect to see Threads explore more features focused on podcast discussions in the months ahead.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nMasayoshi Son isn’t known for half measures. The SoftBank founder’s career has been studded with eyebrow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last. \nHis latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake to go all-in on AI. And while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it’s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn’t push his chips to the center of the table.\nConsider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son’s net worth soared to about $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally – which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history — as SoftBank’s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion. \nAmid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth $150 billion by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry’s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.\nThat Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn’t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley. \nAfter journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as “horrific and deeply regrettable” but insisted SoftBank couldn’t “turn our backs on the Saudi people,” maintaining the firm’s commitment to managing the kingdom’s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.\nThat didn’t turn out so well. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA big bet on Uber generated paper losses for years. Then came WeWork. Son overrode his lieutenants’ objections, fell “in love” with founder Adam Neumann, and assigned the co-working company a dizzying valuation of $47 billion in early 2019 after making several previous investments in the company. But WeWork’s IPO plans collapsed after it published a famously troubling S-1 filing. The company never quite recovered – even after pushing out Neumann and instituting a series of belt-tightening measures – ultimately costing SoftBank $11.5 billion in equity losses and another $2.2 billion in debt. (Son reportedly later called it “a stain on my life.”)\nSon has been mounting another comeback for years, and Tuesday will undoubtedly be remembered as an important moment in his turnaround tale. Indeed, it will likely be recalled as the day SoftBank revealed it had sold all 32.1 million of its Nvidia shares – not to diversify its bets but instead to double down elsewhere, including on a planned $30 billion commitment to OpenAI and to participate (it reportedly hopes) in a $1 trillion AI manufacturing hub in Arizona. \nIf selling that position still gives Son some heartburn, that’s understandable. At about $181.58 per share, SoftBank exited just 14% below Nvidia’s all-time high of $212.19, which is a strong look. That’s remarkably close to peak valuation for such a huge position. Still, the move marks SoftBank’s second complete exit from Nvidia, and the first one was exceedingly costly. (In 2019, SoftBank sold a $4 billion stake in the company for $3.6 billion, shares that would now be worth more than $150 billion.)\nThe move also rattled the market. As of this writing, Nvidia shares are down nearly 3% following the disclosure, even as analysts emphasize that the sale “should not be seen as a cautious or negative stance on Nvidia,” but rather reflects SoftBank needing capital for its AI ambitions.\nWall Street can’t help but wonder: does Son see something right now that others do not? Judging by his track record, maybe — and that ambiguity is all investors have to go on.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nMeta may be about to lose one of its most renowned AI heads: Yann LeCun, a chief AI scientist at the company, is planning to leave the company to build his own startup, the Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources.\nLeCun, a professor at New York University, senior researcher at Meta, and winner of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, plans to leave in the coming months, and is already in talks to raise capital for a startup that would focus on continuing his work on world models, the report added.\nA world model is an AI system that develops an internal understanding of its environment so it can simulate cause-and-effect scenarios to predict outcomes. Top labs and startups like Google DeepMind and World Labs are also developing world models.\nLeCun’s departure would come at a pivotal time for Meta, which has of late changed how it approaches AI development in response to concerns that it is being outpaced by rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.\nThe company has reportedly started revamping its AI organization after hiring over 50 engineers and researchers from its competitors to build out a new AI unit, dubbed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Notably, Meta in June invested $14.3 billion in data-labeling vendor Scale AI and brought on board its CEO Alexandr Wang to run the new division.\nThose decisions, sources told TechCrunch in August, have made things increasingly chaotic at Meta’s AI unit, with new talent expressing frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta’s previous generative AI team has seen its scope limited.\nLeCun’s long-term research work at the company under its Fundamental AI Research Lab (FAIR) division has been overshadowed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s decisions to overhaul things after the company’s previous family of AI models, Llama 4, failed to keep up with rival models. Unlike MSL, FAIR is designed to focus on long-term AI research — techniques that may be used five to 10 years from now.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLeCun has been openly skeptical about how AI technology — specifically LLMs — is currently being marketed as the cure for all of humankind’s ails. He even tweeted that AI systems have a long way to go. \n“It seems to me that before ‘urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us’ we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat,” he wrote.\nMeta did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy, and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow, she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMatt Carey, the co-founder and CEO of Boston-based startup Teradar loves when people tell him: “I don’t believe you.”\nThat’s “right where we want folks,” he recently told TechCrunch. \nCarey has spent the last few years quietly building a solid-state sensor that sees the world using the terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum, which sits between microwaves and infrared. It essentially combines the best traits of radar sensors — like no moving parts and the ability to pierce rain or fog — with the higher definition afforded by laser-based lidar sensors.\nIt’s a product that’s never been done at this scale before, so people are understandably skeptical when Carey explains his work. A long-range, high-resolution sensor that’s also affordable? It just sounds too good to be true.\nIt’s usually at this point that Carey gives them a demo, like at this past year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. There was Carey, outside the Westgate hotel, aiming an early version of the Teradar sensor at crowds of people as reps from some of the biggest automakers watched it parse the scene in real time. \n“They almost didn’t believe it until they got to play with it,” he said. “I’ve never raised money without, like, spending a lot of time in a demo of people trying to break it. And that’s how it should be, right?”\nCarey’s demos — and the tech itself — helped him lock down a $150 million Series B funding round from investors like Capricorn Investment Group, Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, mobility-focused firm IBEX Investors, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTeradar claims to already be working with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe to validate the tech, and expects to win a contract to put the company’s sensors in a 2028-model vehicle — meaning it will need to be ready to go in 2027. Teradar is also working with three Tier 1 suppliers, which he said the company will lean on for manufacturing.\nThe near-term goal for Teradar is for automakers to use its sensors to power advanced driver assistance and even self-driving systems. The “modular terahertz engine,” as the sensor is officially known, can be customized to fit any of those applications, and Carey said the price will fall somewhere between a radar and a lidar. (Think a few hundred dollars, not a few thousand.)\n“How do we get the sensor on every single vehicle? I drive a Ford Focus, and there’s zero chance you’re putting a $1,000 lidar” on that, Carey said.\nCarey said he was inspired to start Teradar after a friend of his died in a car crash.\n“It was one of those weird corner cases where, between the sun, and the fog, it couldn’t have been solved by any existing sensor,” he said. In a situation like that, where there’s lots of glare, cameras typically struggle. Lidar would also be challenged because of the fog. And radar can only help so much with its typically-lower resolution.\nCarey had already been in talks to go work for an automaker, and was thinking about autonomous vehicle tech. In 2021, he started talking to his co-worker Gregory Charvat, the CTO of spatial sensor and intelligence company Humatics, about this apparent problem.\n“[Charvat] was like, ‘you know, I’ve always wanted to be able to image at terahertz,’” Carey said. Shortly after, they started Teradar, with MIT’s The Engine nonprofit incubator leading its seed round.\nThere could be other applications for Teradar’s sensor, like in the defense sector. There’s clearly interest there based on who on the company’s cap table. For now, Carey said the company is almost entirely focused on the automotive business.\nCarey admits he’s not the first to try to leverage the terahertz part of the spectrum; there’s been a litany of academic research, and some attempts to commercialize the tech before. But a lot of that has been focused around industrial or security applications.\nHe said recent advancements in the silicon industry combined with a focused team of experts — including his third co-founder Nick Saiz, who Carey boasted is “the world’s best terahertz chip designer, bar none” — has allowed them to move quickly and woo big automakers.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s been easy, though. \n“It’s very difficult to get their attention, it’s very difficult to get their dollars, and it’s very difficult to get their test track time,” he said. “The fact that they’ve unlocked all of those things for us means a big deal.” \nIn other words: now they believe him.\n"

    "body": "\nEinride said Wednesday it plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, just six weeks after the Swedish electric and autonomous truck startup raised $100 million from investors. The SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp. values Einride at $1.8 billion in pre-money equity, according to the companies.\nThe deal is expected to generate about $219 million in gross proceeds, a figure that doesn’t take into account any redemption of Legato’s public shares. The company is also seeking up to $100 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) capital.\nThe merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with Einride making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.\nEinride was founded in 2016 with an ambition to transform the freight industry, first with electric trucks, then with autonomous electric autonomous pods —  vehicles that lack a steering wheel or pedals designed for self-driving. The company, which hired Roozbeh Charli as its new CEO earlier this year, has been trying to scale three business lines: electric big rigs, autonomous pod-like trucks that navigate fixed routes, and planning software designed for shippers.\nEinride has had some success in expanding beyond Sweden. It operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE, for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has made some inroads with its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the United States.\nEinride, which also has a U.S. headquarters in Austin, Texas, revealed in its announcement that it has a current annual recurring revenue (ARR) run rate of about $45 million and a total contracted base of $65 million ARR from signed customer contracts.\nThe company’s $100 million raise, which was announced in October, was meant to help the company scale with its customer base and accelerate the deployment of its autonomous freight technology, Charli said at the time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEinride previously raised $500 million in 2022 in a Series C round of equity and debt. The equity-based $200 million portion came from backers including Northzone, EQT Ventures, Temasek, Swedish pension fund AMF, Polar Structure, and Norrsken VC. It also secured $300 million in debt funding led by Barclays Europe. The $100 million raise in October included existing investor EQT Ventures and quantum computing company IonQ.\nEinride joins other autonomous vehicle companies that have pursued SPAC mergers in recent years to secure additional funding.\nAurora, which launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board), went public via a SPAC merger valued at $13 billion in 2021. Self-driving trucks startup Kodiak AI took the SPAC road to the public market earlier this year. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nPeople often think about tech bubbles in apocalyptic terms, but it doesn’t have to be as serious as all that. In economic terms, a bubble is a bet that turned out to be too big, leaving you with more supply than demand.  \nThe upshot: It’s not all or nothing, and even good bets can turn sour if you aren’t careful about how you make them. \nWhat makes the question of the AI bubble so tricky to answer is mismatched timelines between the breakneck pace of AI software development and the slow crawl of constructing and powering a data center. \nBecause these data centers take years to build, a lot will inevitably change between now and when they come online. The supply chain that powers AI services is so complex and fluid that it’s hard to have any clarity on how much supply we’ll need a few years from now. It isn’t simply a matter of how much people will be using AI in 2028, but how they’ll be using it, and whether we’ll have any breakthroughs in energy, semiconductor design, or power transmission in the meantime. \nWhen a bet is this big, there are lots of ways it can go wrong — and AI bets are getting very big indeed.  \nLast week, Reuters reported that an Oracle-linked data center campus in New Mexico has drawn as much as $18 billion in credit from a consortium of 20 banks. Oracle has already contracted $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, and the companies have joined with SoftBank to build $500 billion in total AI infrastructure as part of the “Stargate” project. Meta, not to be outdone, has pledged to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. We’ve been tracking all the major commitments here — and the sheer volume has made it hard to keep up. \nAt the same time, there is real uncertainty about how fast demand for AI services will grow.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA McKinsey survey released last week looked at how top firms are employing AI tools. The results were mixed. Almost all the businesses contacted are using AI in some way, yet few are using it on any real scale. AI has allowed companies to cost-cut in specific use cases, but it’s not making a dent on the overall business. In short, most companies are still in “wait and see” mode. If you’re counting on those companies to buy space in your data center, you may be waiting a long time. \nBut even if AI demand is endless, these projects could run into more straightforward infrastructure problems. Last week, Satya Nadella surprised podcast listeners by saying he was more concerned with running out of data center space than running out of chips. (As he put it, “It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.”) At the same time, whole data centers are sitting idle because they can’t handle the power demands of the latest generation of chips.  \nWhile Nvidia and OpenAI have been moving forward as fast as they possibly can, the electrical grid and built environment are still moving at the same pace they always have. That leaves lots of opportunity for expensive bottlenecks, even if everything else goes right. \nWe get deeper into the idea in this week’s Equity podcast, which you can listen to below. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nRaising a $250 million Series D round may seem like a distant and unnecessary distraction to startup founders pitching investors for that first $1 million in seed money. But it shouldn’t be, according to several founders and venture capitalists. In their view, founders should be charting out a strategy for those later stage fundraises from the beginning. \nAven co-founder and CEO Sadi Khan said, while on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, startup founders should start thinking about their later rounds before they raise their first financing. This strategy allows founders to determine how much capital they’ll likely need throughout the growth of their startup. \n“We’re a very capital-intensive company; we provide asset-backed credit cards to consumers,” Khan said. “We require large amounts of capital to scale up, and we’ll require large, large amounts of capital to grow. From day zero, we knew that we needed to have an intensive pipeline of investors that we want to work with over a long period of time.”\nFounders who understand how much capital they need can focus on finding the right investors for an early-stage round while building relationships with later-stage investors of the same flavor.\nLila Preston, head of growth equity at Generation Investment Management, said startups should start building these relationships at least two years before they need the capital.\nStarting these relationships early gives investors time to get to know the business and the market it operates in, Preston added. It also gives investors a peek into the company’s growth. \nSome later-stage investors — like Generation Investment Management, Preston said — can add value to a company long before they invest, if they think an idea is promising.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“When we show up, even at Series A or B, we’ve done the homework so that we’re an additive worthwhile conversation,” Preston said. “‘What are your milestones?’ ‘What does success look like to you?’ As the entrepreneur, [if you are] able to articulate that, you can come back and say, ‘yes, you’ve been able to hit the milestones you set out.’”\nZeya Yang, a partner at IVP, agreed and added that later-stage rounds are closing quicker than ever. Giving investors time to learn about your company in advance helps both sides, Yang noted.\n“It definitely helps to get to know those people earlier than you think you need to,” Yang said. “When you’re actually raising, you’re talking to folks, one that you know you probably get along with, two who’ve already thought about your business a bit, etc. So it’s definitely helpful to think about it well in advance.”\nYang added that when early-stage companies start talking to later stage investors they don’t have to necessarily share all their numbers or metrics quite yet. Instead, they can share the general direction of the company and the overall vision of what it’s building.\nStartups looking to find these late-stage investors should start by turning to their existing cap table, Khan said. A company’s existing investors can connect the founder to other VCs — his early investors introduced him to Khosla Ventures which led the company’s Series E round — that would be a good fit or have worked well the investors on the cap table in the past.\n“At any given stage of fundraising, we always thought about what the next set of investors would be,” Khan said. “We try to build relationships in the previous round with an investor who really focuses on the next stage round. And sometimes we would let them come in on like a symbolic check to really start establishing a relationship.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced its November software update for Pixel phones, called Pixel Drop — a quarterly feature release that brings new capabilities to existing devices — with features including notification summaries, a power-saving mode for the Maps app, prompt-based edits for Photos, and Gemini Nano-powered photo edits in Messages.\nApple introduced notification summaries with its Apple Intelligence suite of features last year. Now, Google is catching up with its own notification summaries for longer chats and conversations on Pixel 9 and later devices. The company said that in December, it will roll out a feature that would silence low-priority notifications. By comparison, Apple has a Priority Notification feature that highlights important  notifications.\nImage credits: Google\nGoogle is introducing a new low-power mode for its Maps app that will darken the screen and only show important information, including the navigation route and details of the next turn. The company said that with this feature, which will be available to Pixel 10 series users, you can save up to four hours of battery life.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company previously introduced scam detection for phone calls using Gemini Nano and on-device speech detection for users in the U.S. with Pixel 9 and later models. It is now expanding this feature to users in the U.K., Ireland, India, Australia, and Canada.\nGoogle is also adding a way to indicate when a message is potentially a scam, by including a “Likely a scam” button in the notification for the message. This builds on the company’s existing feature that analyzes a message’s content and detects spam or scam.\nThe company’s Nano Banana image model has been popular among users. It is now adding a feature called Remix, powered by that model along with Gemini in the Messages app, which lets you use a photo and reimagine it using prompts. The feature is being rolled out to users in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, and New Zealand with RCS enabled and support for the English language.\nGoogle added a Pixel VIPs feature in June that let’s you designate eight of your closest contacts and get updates from them through a home screen widget. With the November Pixel Drop, notifications from these contacts will be prioritized. Plus, if an incident like a flood has occurred in area they live in, you would see a crisis badge in the contacts widget.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company is also adding a new AI-powered editing feature for Google Photos. Users can tap on “Help me edit” and ask Photos to “Remove Riley’s sunglasses, open my eyes, make Engel smile and open her eyes.” The feature will use Google Photo’s face groups feature to recognize people and apply edits.\nThe November drop also expands support for a call transcription feature, called Call Notes, to Australia, Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Japan. And it brings a “Wicked: For Good” theme pack with new wallpapers, icons, system sounds, and GIFs based on the movie for Pixel 6 and later devices.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

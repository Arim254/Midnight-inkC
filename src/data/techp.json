Lux was a seed-stage investor in Anduril, which was last valued at $30.5 billion, and Applied Intuition, an autonomous vehicle startup that secured contracts with the Pentagon and was valued at $15 billion this year.\nLux has also made early bets on AI startups before the industry took off, post-ChatGPT. The firm’s early-stage AI investments include Hugging Face, Runway AI, and MosaicML, the latter of which was acquired by Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023.  \nIn addition to being early to the defense tech and AI trends, Lux has realized significant exits from its investment in AI drug discovery company Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which went public in 2021, and the sale of Auris Health, a surgical robotics pioneer that sold to Johnson & Johnson for up to $6 billion in 2019.\nThe latest fundraise brings Lux’s under management to $7 billion.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n"

On Wednesday the startup announced it raised a new $100 million round just six months after raising a $40 million Series B round led by Iconiq.\nFounded in 2022, Swap Commerce offers an AI-powered platform that helps brands build web storefronts and handle cross-border transactions, inventory management, and returns. The platform has become popular with luxury clothing brands, and the company particularly targets companies looking to sell their goods globally.

Discord, the popular chat and community platform, filed confidential IPO paperwork with the SEC and has pinned its hopes on a debut in March, sources told Bloomberg. The company hired top-tier tech IPO bankers Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as its underwriters. Should the tea leaves continue to look positive for this offering, the public could be getting a peek at Discord’s finances next month.\nBut we’ll have to wait and see. Even if investors are gung-ho, it’s not clear yet whether 2026 will become a better market for IPOs. Discord was reportedly in early-stage talks about an IPO back in March of last year. But then came chaos in the U.S. federal government — between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-inspired budget cuts and the end-of-year federal shutdown — scaring off IPO hopefuls.\nIf the current stock market rally continues and encourages late-stage startups to go public, Discord’s IPO could be one of the biggest of the year. Discord was last valued at $14.7 billion in a 2021 funding round in which it raised $500 million. \nThe chat app, originally made popular by gamers, now claims more than 200 million monthly active users. The company reportedly walked away from a $10 billion acquisition offer by Microsoft in 2021 to remain independent.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n"

In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation. \nCoatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change. \nThis round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips. \nThe fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion.\nAnthropic declined to comment. \nThis article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Fundraising\n\n"

Probably not mentioned at the show is that these gadgets might be creating a massive environmental problem.\nIt isn’t something that tends to get much attention, but a new study from Cornell University and the University of Chicago found that by 2050, demand for health wearables could hit 2 billion units per year, or 42 times more than today. Unless we change how they’re made, these devices could generate over a million tons of electronic waste and 100 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same period, the authors warn.\nAn even bigger surprise is that it’s not the plastic that’s the problem. The study, published in Nature, found that the printed circuit board — the device’s “brain” — accounts for 70% of its carbon footprint, largely due to intensive mining and manufacturing.\nThe researchers suggest two fixes: develop chips using common metals like copper instead of rare minerals like gold, and make devices modular so the circuit board can be reused while the outer covering gets replaced.\nWrote one of the study’s co-authors, “When these devices are deployed at global scale, small design choices add up quickly.” It’s something to think about while scrolling through CES announcements.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Biotech & Health\n\n"

    "body": "\nSkylight may have started as a digital picture frame, but today, the company is more focused on helping families stay organized with shared calendars, lists, meal planning tools, and more.\nAt CES 2026, the company debuted its latest product: the Skylight Calendar 2, which offers a sleeker design than the original 15-inch calendar, but smaller than the 27-inch wall-mounted Calendar Max. Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.\nThe biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.\nThe calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules with a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper and the calendar updates with the new events.)\nImage Credits:Sarah Perez\nThe company is also trying to address other pain points for families such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use.\nThe app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and even imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use. For instance, they can check off their chores by looking for a picture, even if they can’t yet read. Parents also like the ability to plan meals, whether that’s noting simply that Tuesday will be taco night, or going as far as finding a recipe and preparing a shopping list. Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app.\nAnother clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers. Skylight, a bootstrapped and profitable company from day one, now has 1.3 million-plus families using its digital calendars so far, and likely more to come as the new design ships.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAt CES 2026, AMC debuted clips from its upcoming TV series “The Audacity,” created by Jonathan Glatzer, a TV writer and producer for shows like “Succession,” “Better Call Saul,” and “Bloodline.” The new show will focus on how the men and women of Silicon Valley are shaping the world we live in today.\n“They’re literally laying the cement on the freeway that we’re all driving down with things like AI, data collection, social media, etc. And there couldn’t be any more important group, in my opinion, to be taking a deep-dive look at than the men and women in Silicon Valley who are shaping the lives that we live,” explained Dan McDermott, chief content officer at AMC Networks and president of AMC Studios, speaking at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES.\nAs one of the show’s actors, Billy Magnussen, noted, “Silicon Valley is one of those times in our modern era which is defining humanity. And what better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point?”\nThe show will also star Sarah Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Simon Helberg, and Rob Corddry and will take place in a fictional universe where no real company names are involved, nor will high-profile tech figures make cameos. However, the show may still hit some familiar chords. For instance, Helberg’s character is a maladjusted genius, working on an AI therapy app for teenagers, when he himself is something of a recluse, with a teenage daughter he neglects.\n“There’s loneliness, I think, at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls,” Helberg says.\nTwo new clips from the shows were streamed at the event, but recording was not allowed. In one, an enthusiastic Magnussen pitches Galifianakis when encountering him eating at a restaurant. Galifianakis never responds but cuts him off eventually by stabbing him in the hand with his fork. Another clip showed Helberg completely missing an opportunity to relate to his daughter, and instead using her facial expression of annoyance to train his AI.\nThe show premieres Sunday, April 12 on AMC and AMC+. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. \nTo begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues. \nThis new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus.\nBy bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. \nPlus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class.\nHowever, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. \nGoogle urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then.

    "body": "\nCaterpillar is digging deeper into incorporating AI and automation into its fleet of construction machinery through a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia.\nThe construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.\nBrandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.\nOne of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.\n“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”\nCaterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations. \nThe company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”\nWorking with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.\nBill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.\nDuring its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.\nWhile some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.\n“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s CES coverage here. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The company on Wednesday said it is introducing a new Messages feature that will let users see what their friends are streaming in real time and send requests to start Jams, the app’s collaborative listening feature.\nUsers would first have to navigate to their Settings and turn on the “listening activity” feature in the “Privacy & Social” section. Once that’s done, your listening activity will appear at the top of Messages chats. You can tap a friend’s listening activity to play the track, save it, open the menu, or react with an emoji.\nAs for starting a Jam, Premium users can tap the “Jam” option in the top-right corner to send a request to their friends. If the other user accepts it, they will become the Jam host, and both users would be able to add tracks to a shared queue and listen to music together.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nListening Activity and Request to Jam will roll out to the iOS and Android apps in markets where Messages is available, and will be broadly available in these markets by early February. Listening Activity is available to all users with access to Messages, while Free users can join a Request to Jam session when invited by a Premium user.\nSpotify notes that because both of these new features are available through Messages, they are only available to users 16 and older. \nThe streaming platform launched Messages in August 2025 in a bid to become a more social app. While users have long shared Spotify links to music and podcasts outside the platform, the new messaging capabilities signal a push to keep more interactions within the app as the company looks to increase user retention metrics and attract more paying users.\nMessages on Spotify can only be sent to individual users at the moment, and you can only chat with people you’ve previously shared content with, such as collaborators on a playlist or participants in a Jam or Blend. Messages are encrypted at rest and in transit, but they are not protected by end-to-end encryption. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify is lowering its eligibility criteria for podcasters to monetize their videos on the platform, dropping the minimum episode requirement to three, minimum consumption hours to 2,000, and engaged audience member threshold to 1,000 over the last 30 days. \nWhen the company introduced its partner program to monetize video content last year, creators needed to have published 12 episodes, hit 10,000 consumption hours over the prior 30 days, and had at least 2,000 people stream their content in the last 30 days to be part of the program. \nThe program pays podcasters according to the number of premium users who watched their videos on Spotify, alongside a share of ad revenue earned from users on the free tier.\nThe company is also introducing new sponsorship tools that would allow creators to update, schedule, and measure sponsorship spots read by hosts in video ads. These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.\nDoubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.\nThe new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched. \nBut that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood.

    "body": "\nIf there is one point of consensus among the CES 2026 keynote speakers, it is that AI is reshaping technology with a speed and scale unlike any previous technological revolution.\nIn a live taping on Tuesday of the All-In podcast, co-host Jason Calacanis interviewed Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.\n“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.\nTaneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said. \nCalacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”\nCFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.\nAnother key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.\nMeanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.\nCalacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.\nSternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSmart home startup Quilt introduced a three-zone heat pump on Tuesday that promises to maintain efficiency even in the kinds of demanding conditions that stymie traditional incumbents. \nThe three-zone unit does what it says on the label: One outdoor unit is now capable of driving three indoor heads, as they’re known in the HVAC world. It’s a product that will make large installations simpler and cheaper while minimizing the footprint outside the home, and it’s key to the startup’s plans for expansion, which were recently turbocharged by a $20 million Series B focused on expanding sales.\nBut the real story is how Quilt developed the new product.\nSince its founding, Quilt has prided itself on the amount of data it collects from its heat pumps. Not only are they internet-connected, they’re also laced with more sensors than typical heat pumps. \nBy analyzing that data, Quilt engineers have been able to do things that other companies have not. In September, for example, they shipped an over-the-air update to heat pumps in people’s homes that unlocked an additional 20% capacity, which could be directed toward either one or two zones. With the free update, people could be more comfortable during heat waves and cold snaps. \nThe team also used the data to develop the new three-zone unit and, in the process, solve a vexing challenge that many competitors face.\nLike all heat pumps, multi-zone units work best when they’re run at variable speed — that is, when heating or cooling demand is low, the compressor runs at a lower speed to deliver only the amount of heating or cooling that’s needed. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut there are limits to how low they can operate. Compressors become less stable at low speeds, making them harder to control. Matthew Knoll, co-founder and CTO at Quilt, compares it to driving a car a low speeds. Maintaining an even 70 mph is easier than a steady 11 mph. “It’s a little harder,” he said. \nTo compensate, most systems stop the compressor at a certain point, sacrificing some efficiency and comfort in the process.\nQuilt, though, was able to draw on data collected from the thousand or so units already installed in people’s homes and businesses, giving them insights into how the systems were operating in the real world.\n“The way most systems are developed, they’re tested in a lab under a couple scenarios because testing’s expensive. And you end up with kind of a you know an average product,” Knoll said. \n“We have a thousand units out there in many different climates, and if we see something, we can look at it across a bunch of different units to understand if there’s room to optimize or if we’re seeing a problem in a corner case,” he said\nThe company also uses a larger copper coil than many competitors, which allows it to spec a smaller compressor. That combination, along with some other tweaks to the design, allows Quilt to deliver nearly 90% of its rated capacity (27,000 BTUs) at -13˚ F (-25˚ C) without sacrificing low-demand performance or efficiency. Quilt says it’s the most efficient three-zone mini-split on the market.\nTo save power, each indoor head can be controlled individually, supplying as little as 2,210 BTUs of heat or 1,570 BTUs of cooling. If heating or cooling isn’t needed, refrigerant still flows through the lines like it does in other heat pumps. But thanks to the outdoor unit’s low-speed performance, it only releases around 300 BTUs of heat in heating mode. That’s about as much heat as a grown adult throws off.\nWhere does Quilt go from here? Knoll wouldn’t comment on future plans other than to say that Quilt “wants to be able to have a solution for all homes.” More products are coming, and it’s likely that reams of data will help lead their development.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft announced Thursday it would buy 3.6 million carbon removal credits from a biofuels plant in Louisiana owned by C2X. The plant, which is slated to begin operating in 2029, will process forestry waste into methanol, which can be used to power ships and planes and as a raw material for chemical manufacturing. Altogether, the facility will produce more than 500,000 metric tons of methanol. About 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide will be captured and stored, likely underground.\nThe purchase is one of many that Microsoft has made in the last year or so, including a 4.9 million metric ton deal with Vaulted Deep, a 3.7 million metric ton agreement with CO280, and a 7 million metric ton buy from Chestnut Carbon. Microsoft’s rapid expansion of its data center footprint has imperiled its 2030 pledge to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates. While the company also buys large amounts of renewable and nuclear power, carbon renewal purchases like these will help offset future fossil fuel emissions.\n"

    "body": "\nGrok, the chatbot built by Elon Musk’s xAI and popularized on his social media platform X, appears to have repeatedly spread misinformation about today’s mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Australia.\nGizmodo pointed to a number of posts where Grok misidentified the bystander — 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed — who disarmed one of the gunmen, and where it questioned the authenticity of videos and photos capturing al Ahmed’s actions.\nIn one post, the chatbot misidentified the man in a photo as an Israeli hostage, and in another post brought up irrelevant information about the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians. In another post, it claimed a “43-year-old IT professional and senior solutions architect” named Edward Crabtree was the one who actually disarmed a gunman.\nGrok does appear to be fixing some of its mistakes. At least one post that reportedly claimed a video of the shooting actually showed Cyclone Alfred has been corrected “upon reevaluation.”\nAnd the chatbot subsequently acknowledged al Ahmed’s identity, writing that the “misunderstanding arises from viral posts that mistakenly identified him as Edward Crabtree, possibly due to a reporting error or a joke referencing a fictional character.” (The article in question appeared on a largely non-functional news site that may be AI-generated.)\n"

    "body": "\nFintech startup Mesa has shut down its Homeowners Card, which awarded points to cardholders for paying their mortgages.\nA message on the Mesa website states that as of December 12, “all Mesa Homeowners Card accounts are closed,” adding, “All credit cards have been deactivated and you are no longer able to make any new purchases or earn Mesa Points.”\nA Mesa FAQ about the shutdown described this as “a business decision to close the Mesa Homeowners Card Program entirely.” TechCrunch has reached out to Mesa for additional comment on its future plans.\nThe startup launched just over a year ago, in November 2024, with $9.2 million in funding ($7.2 million in equity funding and $2 million in debt). It offered two products — mortgage loans with 1% cash back, as well as the credit card with rewards including cash back, travel, and offset mortgage payments.\nAt the time, CEO Kelley Halpin told TechCrunch that the startup had “taken what everybody loves about travel and dining cards to re-contextualize that for the homeowner/parent.”\nIn theory, you could earn points for home expenses by using any credit card with rewards, but Mesa said it structured its points program to incentivize spending related to home ownership.\n“So it’s not rewarding you on travel and dining spend; it’s rewarding you on gas, groceries, your HOA, utilities, home goods as well as your mortgage payment,” Halpin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBilt, which has a rewards card that allows customers to earn points on rent payments, says it will expand with points for mortgage payments when it launches a revamped card next year.\nMesa’s card shutdown has been covered by travel deals websites like One Mile at a Time and Upgraded Points, which say that Mesa cardmembers have been complaining about declined transactions for the past week, with the company initially claiming this was only a temporary outage.\nNow, it seems the only remaining way to redeem points earned on the Mesa card is through a statement credit at a rate of 0.6%.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

According to the sheriff’s department, the footage shows that after dropping off the food and taking a photo, the woman appeared to spray a substance towards the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain.\nThe sheriff’s department said that using DoorDash records, detectives identified the woman as Kourtney Stevenson of Kentucky, who told local police in a phone call that she had been working for DoorDash while visiting her father, and that she’d used pepper spray to spray a spider. But the department also said that with an overnight low of 35 degrees Fahrenheit, “outdoor spiders in Indiana are not active and would not be capable of crawling on exposed surfaces.”\nWhen Stevenson allegedly declined to come in for an interview, detectives obtained a warrant to arrest her for battery resulting in a moderate injury and consumer product tampering.

    "body": "\nApple is releasing another tool to dial down Liquid Glass’ transparency with its release of iOS 26.2, out now. With the update, users will be able to control the transparency of the Lock Screen’s clock. The release follows an update that introduced a slider for controlling the opacity of Liquid Glass elements through the operating system, following user complaints that the changes made their iPhone or other Apple device too hard to read.\nLaunched with iOS 26, the new design language for Apple devices turns various interface elements like buttons, sliders, and notifications semi-transparent. The elements also refract light, giving them the optical qualities of glass.\nMeant to modernize Apple’s operating systems and potentially prepare for a world where the operating system moves to AI smart glasses, Liquid Glass received mixed reviews. Some found that the transparency made their device difficult to use, as it became tricky to read key items, like notifications or the name of an artist in Apple Music. In response to user complaints, Apple released a Liquid Glass tool in iOS 26.1 that allowed users to return their interface to a more “frosted” look, if desired.\nWith the slider for the Clock’s “glassiness,” Apple is again rolling back the transparency of the Liquid Glass update, but in the form of another user-controlled customization feature, instead of a global change.\nImage Credits:iPhone screenshot by TechCrunch\nThese tweaks are notable as they telegraph that perhaps Apple isn’t standing 100% behind the design overhaul as being perfect as is.\nThe timing of the change is worth noting, too. Earlier this month, Apple confirmed the design executive behind the Liquid Glass makeover, Alan Dye, was leaving the company for Meta. While it didn’t appear that Dye was pushed out, Apple replaced him with longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. \nUnlike Dye, Lemay’s career was spent in interface and interaction design — a skill set called for when it comes to fixing Liquid Glass, it can be argued.\n\niOS 26.2 brought other new features beyond the latest Liquid Glass tweak.\nAs in the betas, users can now create AirDrop codes to share with people not in their contacts, allowing them to become a “known” AirDrop contact for a 30-day period. The feature might make sense at work or in other scenarios where you need to share files or photos with someone not stored in your Contacts.\nAlso in iOS 26.2, the Reminders supports alarms; Apple News gains a Following tab at the bottom nav bar along with other navigation changes; Apple Music adds offline lyrics; and the Podcasts app adds AI-generated chapters for podcast episodes, a Podcast Mention feature for linking to other shows, and other changes. \nApple Watch owners will also now get a Sleep Score based on how well they slept and if they met their sleep goals. \nApple also released several important security updates across its flagship products on Friday, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches, to patch vulnerabilities used in an active hacking campaign.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle is rolling out a beta experience that lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language-learning tools in the Translate app.\nThe new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker’s tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it’s easier to follow the conversation and tell who’s saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. \n“Whether you’re trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate’ and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in the blog post.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages.\nThe company plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. \nAs for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They’ll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions.\nFor example, if you’re trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you’ll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nThis update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German. The update is available in the Translate app on Android, iOS, and on the web.\nGoogle is also expanding its language learning tools to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. English speakers can now practice German, while Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish speakers can practice English. \nThe tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. \nAdditionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you’ve been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent.

    "body": "\nThere’s something painfully American about the arc of iRobot, the company that taught your vacuum to navigate around the furniture. Founded in 1990 in Bedford, Massachusetts by MIT roboticist Rodney Brooks and his former students Colin Angle and Helen Greiner, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday, punctuating a 35-year run that took it from the dreams of AI researchers to your kitchen floor and, finally, to the tender mercies of its Chinese supplier.\nBrooks, the founding director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab and the robotics field’s resident provocateur, spent the eighties watching insects and having epiphanies about how simple systems could produce complex behaviors. By 1990, he’d translated those insights into a company that would eventually sell over 50 million robots. The Roomba, launched in 2002, became the rare gadget that transcended its category to become a verb, a meme, and, to the amusement of many, a cat-transportation device.\nThe money soon followed, with the company raising $38 million altogether, including from The Carlyle Group, before going public in a 2005 IPO that raised $103.2 million. By 2015, iRobot was flush enough to launch its own venture arm, prompting TechCrunch to wryly declare that “robot domination may have just taken another step forward.” The plan at the time was to invest $100,000 to $2 million in up to 10 seed and Series A robotics startups each year. It was the kind of move that marks a company’s arrival, the moment when you’re successful enough to fund the next generation’s dreams.\nThen Amazon came knocking. In 2022, the corporate giant agreed to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion in what would have been Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition ever at the time. In a press release announcing the tie-up, Angle, who’d been CEO since the company’s inception, spoke about “creating innovative, practical products” and finding “a better place for our team to continue our mission.” It seemed like a fairy tale ending — the scrappy MIT spinoff absorbed into the Everything Store’s sprawling empire.\nExcept European regulators had other ideas. Indeed, amid threats they would block the deal — they believed Amazon could foreclose rivals by restricting or degrading access to its marketplace — Amazon and iRobot agreed to kill the deal in January 2024, with Amazon paying a $94 million breakup fee and walking away. Angle resigned. The company’s shares nosedived. It shed 31% of its workforce.\nWhat followed afterward was a slow-motion collapse. Earnings had been declining since 2021 thanks to supply chain chaos and Chinese competitors flooding the market with cheaper robot vacuums. The Carlyle Group, which provided a $200 million lifeline back in 2023, ultimately just prolonged the inevitable. (Carlyle finally sold that loan last month — presumably at a discount, though it didn’t specify either way.)\nNow it’s over, at least, the version of iRobot that existed previously. Shenzhen PICEA Robotics, iRobot’s main supplier and lender, will take control of the reorganized company. According to a release issued by iRobot on Sunday, the restructuring plan allows iRobot to remain as a going concern and “continue operating in the ordinary course with no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt also vowed to “meet its commitments to employees and make timely payments in full to vendors and other creditors for amounts owed throughout the court-supervised process.”\nWhat this means for customers longer term is another question, one iRobot was eager to answer when we reached out to the company. “To be clear, today’s news has no impact on our business operations or our ability to serve our customers – which continues to be our top priority,” said spokeswoman Michèle Szynal in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “We remain focused on delivering intelligent home innovations that make consumers’ lives better and easier.  Our products are not changing.”\nIn its release, iRobot similarly promises to keep supporting existing products during restructuring; at the same time, its legal disclosures acknowledge the inherent uncertainties of bankruptcy — whether suppliers stick around, whether the process goes as planned, whether the company survives at all.\nAs The Verge noted in a story about iRobot’s struggles last month, even if iRobot eventually collapses and takes its cloud services down with it, customers’ Roomba vacuums won’t become useless pucks. The physical controls should keep working — a Roomba owner could still jab the button to send it off to vacuum or tell it to head home. \nWhat Roomba owners would lose is everything that make the devices feel futuristic, including app-based scheduling, the ability to tell it which rooms to clean, and voice commands barked at Alexa while sprawled on the couch.\nUpdate: This story has been updated with comment from iRobot.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nFusion power has the potential to rewrite trillion-dollar energy markets, but first, startups have to prove their designs will work and won’t be too costly. Neither is easy, especially when considering the massive magnets and lasers used in many designs must be installed with millimeter precision or better.\nFusion startup Thea Energy says it’s pixel-inspired reactor and specialized control software should be able to generate power without requiring the same level of perfection.\n“It doesn’t have to be as good to begin with,” Brian Berzin, co-founder and CEO of Thea Energy,  told TechCrunch. “We have a way to tune out imperfections on the back end.” That margin of error could give Thea a leg up on the competition. \nFusion power plants promise to deliver gigawatts of clean power to the grid, but material and construction costs threaten to make them uncompetitive with cheap solar and wind. By building a power plant first and ironing out the kinks in software, Thea could help bring the cost of fusion power down dramatically.\nThis animation shows how Helios can be disassembled for maintenance.Image Credits:Thea Energy\nBut first the company has to build a working prototype. Today, Thea is publishing the details of its design, including the details of the physics that underpin it. The startup shared the paper exclusively with TechCrunch.\nThea is building a unique take on the stellarator, a specific type of reactor that uses magnets to whip the plasma fuel into shape. Magnets are one of the two main ways that fusion scientists keep plasma heat and confine plasma until fusion reactions occur. The other, known as inertial confinement, uses lasers or some other force to squeeze small fuel pellets.\nMost stellarators are built with magnets that looks at home in a Salvador Dali painting. But Thea’s design uses a dozen larger magnets and hundreds of smaller ones to create what you might call a “virtual” stellarator.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a typical stellarator, the magnets are built to follow the contours of a shape that’s intended to work with the quirks of plasma, helping to confine it for longer using less power than tokamaks, which use a series of identically sized and shaped magnets. Yet stellarators have one major disadvantage: the irregular shape makes mass manufacturing magnets challenging.\nSo instead, Thea designed its reactor around small, identical superconducting magnets that are arranged in arrays. The startup will use software to control each magnet individually to generate magnetic fields that can replicate a stellarator’s wobbly shape.\nA cutaway view of plasma flowing through Helios’s reactor core.Image Credits:Thea Energy\nThe approach has several upsides. For one, it has allowed Thea to rapidly iterate on its magnet design. In the last two years, the company has tweaked the design more than 60 times, Berzin said. “Most fusion companies, you’re dealing with magnets that are the size of a car or a laser the size of a car or a wedge the size of car. That unfortunately means one is $20 million and takes two years [to make],” he said.\nIt has also meant the company can use software controls to overcome any irregularities in the way the magnets were made or installed. To test its original control system, Thea built a three-by-three array of its magnets laced with sensors. The controls, which were derived from the physics of electromagnetism, worked well. But the company also wanted to see how AI might handle the task, so it also trained a new one using reinforced learning.\nThe team came away surprised at how well it all worked.\n“We purposefully threw curveballs at the array,” Berzin said. “We purposefully dismounted a magnet by literally over a centimeter. You could see it was super out of line. It was really hard for us to actually manufacture it so poorly.” The team also tested superconducting material from five different manufacturers along with intentionally defective material. “Every single time we did that, the control system, without us turning knobs and intervening, was able to tune out those defects,” he said.\nThea’s reactor design, Helios, will use two types of magnets. One the outside, 12 large magnets of four different shapes will do the heavy lifting to keep the plasma confined. They’re similar to those found on a tokamak, the type of doughnut-shaped reactor that competitor Commonwealth Fusion Systems is building. Inside the large coils, 324 smaller circular magnets will fine tune the shape of the plasma.\nThe startup predicts Helios will generate 1.1 gigawatts of heat, which a steam turbine will turn into 390 megawatts of electricity. The reactor will have to shut down for an 84-day maintenance period once every two years. If all goes well, that means its capacity factor — a measure of how much power it generates over a given period of time — will be 88%. That’s far better than today’s gas-fired power plants and almost as good as today’s nuclear power plants.\nHelios is still in the conceptual phase. Thea first has to build Eos, its initial fusion device that’s intended to prove the science behind the concept. Berzin said the company will announce a site for Eos in 2026 with plans to turn it on “around 2030.” \nAs it builds Eos, Thea plans to start work in parallel on Helios. It’s a similar approach to how Commonwealth Fusion Systems is moving forward with work on Arc, its first commercial power plant, while building Sparc, its demonstration plant.\nFor now, Berzin is looking forward to hearing what the fusion community thinks. “This is the release of the overview paper. This will be followed up by quite a substantial amount of work that will come out via peer review and publication,” he said. “Now is the moment for us to go and set up the partnerships, collaborations, get the end users engaged to go build the first one.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI lets anyone create videos, but many AI video creation tools lack support for audio. Mirelo is building AI that adds soundtracks to match the video’s action. \nEarlier this year, the Berlin-based startup released Mirelo SFX v1.5, an AI model that interprets videos to add synced sound effects (SFX). \nThis attracted attention from VCs gearing up for a generative AI revolution in games. The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\nThis new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and ElevenLabs, which is also backed by a16z.\nWhile Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch.\nThese new hires will support Mirelo’s R&D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on Fal.ai and Replicate, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use.\nAs Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index’s investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists’ rights. \nIt’s a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn’t displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos.\nAccording to Simon-Gabriel, creators can’t fully benefit from this new potential without audio. \n“George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It’s not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it’s an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”\nHe and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. \n“It’s easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted.\nThis could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo’s total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap.\nThe startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others.\nStill, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. \nFor instance, Gemini’s video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind’s Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.’ But, of course, you should add some. It’s a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWhatsApp, Meta’s messaging app that millions of Indians rely on daily, is facing a critical moment in India as recent government directions threaten to disrupt how the platform works for everyday users and businesses.\nIssued late last month and made public earlier this month, the directions ask certain app-based communication services to keep accounts continuously linked to an active SIM card and impose stricter controls on how the apps function across devices.\nNew Delhi says the measures are aimed at curbing rising cyber fraud in India, the world’s most populous nation. Digital advocacy groups, policy experts, and industry groups representing major digital platforms — including Meta — have warned, however, that the approach risks regulatory overreach and could disrupt legitimate use, especially in a country where WhatsApp has evolved into everyday infrastructure for personal communication and small-business commerce.\nThe directions, which app providers including Meta, Telegram, and Signal must comply with within 90 days of their issuance on November 28, require messaging apps to remain tied to the SIM card used at sign-up. The web and desktop versions of these apps also require users to log out every six hours and re-link their devices via a QR code to regain access.\n“Mandatory continuous SIM–device binding and periodic logout ensure that every active account and web session is anchored to a live, KYC-verified SIM, restoring traceability of numbers used in phishing, investment, digital arrest, and loan scams,” the telecom ministry said in a press release earlier this month, adding that India suffered cyber-fraud losses exceeding ₹228 billion (about $2.5 billion) in 2024 alone.\nThe Indian government has clarified that the rules do not apply when the SIM remains in the device, and the user is roaming.\nWhile the directions apply broadly to major instant messaging apps, their impact is likely to be felt most acutely by WhatsApp, which is used by more than 500 million people in India. The app’s adoption in India is also unusually deep. As much as 94% of WhatsApp’s Indian monthly user base opened the app daily in November, while 67% of WhatsApp Business users in the country did the same, according to Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. By comparison, 59% of WhatsApp monthly users in the U.S. opened the app daily, alongside 57% for WhatsApp Business.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany merchants in India rely on the WhatsApp Business app — a smartphone-based version of the service tailored for small enterprises — typically registering the account on a SIM-linked phone while handling customer conversations through WhatsApp’s web or desktop client on another device. Unlike larger companies that use WhatsApp’s Business APIs for automated, CRM-linked communication, these small businesses access their customers through WhatsApp Business and its companion web interface, meaning mandatory SIM binding and frequent forced logouts could break workflows for order-taking, support, and customer engagement.\nThe potential disruption in India comes as WhatsApp has been steadily expanding its multi-device and companion-device capabilities, allowing users and businesses to stay logged in across phones, browsers, and devices without relying on a single active smartphone.\nRapid expansion to deep entrenchment\nThe directions come as WhatsApp is undergoing a significant shift in India, its biggest market, with growth increasingly driven by retaining existing users rather than rapidly expanding its new user base.\nWhatsApp’s monthly active users in India on mobile devices are up 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to date, even as downloads have fallen nearly 49%, per Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. Compared with late 2022, WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India are up 24%, while downloads are down 14% over the same period, the market intelligence firm said.\n“It could be fair to say that user (MAU) growth for WhatsApp in India across the past few years has been driven more by retention (successfully re-engaging existing or previous users) than acquiring new users,” said Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower.\nData from Appfigures shows WhatsApp Business has consistently recorded more estimated first-time installs than WhatsApp Messenger in India since early 2024, reflecting how growth has increasingly been driven by merchant adoption rather than broad-based consumer expansion.\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\nPart of that pattern reflects how WhatsApp is used in India, said Randy Nelson, head of insights at Appfigures. It is common for merchants to maintain separate WhatsApp identities for personal and customer communication, often enabled by dual-SIM phones, while a single business can generate multiple installs across staff and shop devices.\nSensor Tower data points in the same direction. WhatsApp Business monthly active users in India were still growing year over year in late 2025 and are up more than 130% compared with 2021, far outpacing WhatsApp Messenger’s roughly 34% growth over the same period, the market intelligence firm’s data estimates.\nWhile overall engagement remains higher on WhatsApp — with Indian users opening the app daily and spending an average of 38 minutes a day in November, compared with 27 minutes on WhatsApp Business — the gap looks different in the U.S., where users spent about 23 minutes a day on WhatsApp and 27 minutes on WhatsApp Business, Sensor Tower estimates show.\nIndia’s directions raise “serious questions of technical feasibility”\nIn a statement last week, industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF), whose members include Meta, said the measures could result in “material inconvenience and service disruption on ordinary users,” adding that they raise “serious questions of technical feasibility.”\nThe directions hinge on a new and still-contested classification of Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs) under India’s telecom cybersecurity rules, said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of New Delhi-based public policy think tank The Dialogue, effectively placing messaging apps within a telecom framework — a shift from their traditional regulation under the country’s IT Act — through executive directions rather than formal legislation.\n“The directions derive their power not from statute but from delegated legislation,” Rizvi told TechCrunch. “Moreover, the lack of public consultations or technical working groups risks creating compliance friction without addressing the underlying fraud vectors.”\nIndia’s telecom ministry did not respond to a request for comments.\nFor now, companies including Meta have limited room to challenge the directions in court, according to tech policy experts.\nChallenging the directions would typically require showing either that they exceed the scope of the underlying law or that they violate constitutional protections, said Dhruv Garg, a tech policy advisor and partner at the Indian Governance and Policy Project — a high bar that may be difficult to meet in this case.\nMeta declined to comment on this article.\n"

    "body": "\nWhether or not Netflix’s $82.6 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. goes through, the deal encapsulates a fraught moment for Hollywood, as the entertainment business is increasingly overshadowed by tech giants.\nOn the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec and I discussed the deal’s implications, both for Netflix and the larger Hollywood ecosystem. Kirsten noted that it’s just the latest move bringing more consolidation to the media business, and she wondered whether it’s “too big a risk” for Netflix.\nMeanwhile, I discussed a call with Netflix executives where Wall Street analysts also seemed to be struggling to wrap their heads around the deal. And then of course there’s Paramount’s competing hostile bid — whatever happens, Warner Bros.’ days as a standalone company seem to be numbered.\nYou can read an edited preview of our conversation below.\nKirsten: I remember when Netflix was just a little baby startup and I got their [DVDs] in the mail. Here they are, all grown up, bidding for a legacy company. Did that run through your head when you saw the news?\nAnthony: Certainly symbolically, it’s this moment where the upstart has eaten Hollywood. There’ve been all these articles, even before this deal, saying, “Netflix is eating Hollywood, Netflix is transforming Hollywood.” Regardless of whether or not this deal ends up going through, Netflix will have transformed Hollywood, but this seems like the biggest — both symbolically but also substantively — one of the most dramatic things that can happen. \nThen there are all these other questions about: Will Netflix get regulatory approval? Will Paramount’s hostile bid succeed?\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhat jumped out to you is you were catching up on it, Kirsten?\nKirsten: Well, the first thing was I was like, can there be any more consolidation in this market? I mean, that was the big one for me, because if memory serves, Warner Bros. already went through like this consolidation with Discovery, right? So here we are again. There’s been so much consolidation that I have lost track of all of that.\nBut the second thought was what I immediately thought, what I kicked [off our discussion] with, which is really thinking about how Netflix [has grown], and there have been these dips in the road along its way, where the headlines have been about how it’s struggling, and will it remain relevant, and how can it do that? If they’re successful in the actual deal, [it would] potentially reflect [that] they have made it.\nBut then again, they have to execute on [running] an even bigger company than ever before. And so I guess my third thought on this is: Should they be buying this? Is this what it takes for them to expand? Is it a risk for them to take on so much? Why not just stay as they are? And I don’t know if you agree with me on that one. Is it too big of a risk? \nAnthony: I can see how it makes sense for Netflix. It’s a way to take a [content] library that is already quite large, and they’ve obviously had some very successful TV shows — less so on the movie side — [but] potentially, they just become so much stronger on the content side.\n[And] they’re suddenly now involved in all these other businesses, although the question is to what extent are they going to invest in things like the theatrical business, theme parks, making TV shows for other streaming services and networks, which are all businesses that Warner Bros is in, and Netflix says it will continue to support. But we’ll see to what extent that’s true.\nSo it seems like something that can really benefit Netflix in some ways, but, at the same time, it does seem like this is a huge risk. If you go and look at the analyst call that Netflix’s executives did after announcing the deal, you can see that the analysts are wrestling with it and wondering “Okay, I can see that this grows your business, but does it grow your business [so much that it’s] worth an $82 billion deal?”\nAnd then of course, beyond the Netflix perspective, you have everybody else in Hollywood. There are all these maybe accurately hyperbolic headlines about: Is this the end of Hollywood? Is this the end of the movie theater business? All the unions are basically saying either, “This deal should be blocked” or “We’re very, very, very worried about this deal.” The theater owners are saying that\nAnd so I think there’s A) Is this a good deal for Netflix? And B) is this a good deal for the entertainment business? I don’t have a good answer for either, [but] I think it’s more likely to be a good deal for Netflix than it is to be a good deal for the entertainment business.\nThough again, part of what to keep in mind as people weigh those options or think about possible outcomes here, is that because of the way that Paramount has forced Warner Bros. to consider these acquisition offers, it seems unlikely that Warner Bros. is going to be able to continue as an independent company — which, if you’re not a fan of media consolidation, that is disappointing.\n\n\n\n"

    "body": "\nThe robot swerved through the cafeteria of Rivian’s Palo Alto office, shelves adorned with chilled canned coffees — until it didn’t. Five minutes later, a man carefully pushed it out of everyone’s way, the words “I’m stuck” flashing yellow on the poor droid’s screen.\nIt was an inauspicious start to Rivian’s “Autonomy & AI Day,” a showcase for the company’s plans to make its vehicles capable of driving themselves. Rivian doesn’t make the cafeteria robot and isn’t responsible for its abilities, but there was a familiar message in its foibles: this stuff is hard.\nHours later, as I rode in a 2025 R1S SUV during my 15-minute demo of Rivian’s new self-described “Large Driving Model,” I was reminded of that message.\nThe EV equipped with the automated-driving software drove myself and two Rivian employees on a switchback route near the company’s campus. As we glided past Tesla’s engineering office, I noticed a Model S in front of us slow to turn into the rival company’s lot. The R1S eventually noticed this, too, braking hard just before the Rivian employee nearly intervened.\nDuring my demo drive, there was one actual disengagement. The employee in the driver’s seat took over as we passed through a one-lane section of road due to some tree-trimming. Minor stuff overall. But it wasn’t exactly rare either; I spotted multiple other demo rides that had disengagements, too.\nThe rest of the drive went well enough for software that is not ready to be shipped, especially when you consider that Rivian threw out its old rules-based driver assistance system and adopted an end-to-end approach — which is how Tesla developed Full Self-Driving (Supervised). It stopped at stoplights, it handled turns, it slowed for speed bumps, all without programmed rules telling it to do these things.\nA quiet pivot in 2021\nImage Credits:Rivian\nRivian’s old system “was all very deterministic, and it was all very structured,” CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview Thursday. “Everything that the vehicle did was the result of a prescribed control strategy written by humans.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nScaringe said that when Rivian saw transformer-based artificial intelligence taking off in 2021, he quietly “reconstituted the team and started with a clean sheet and said, let’s design our self-driving platform for an AI-centric world.”\nAfter spending “a lot of time in the basement,” Rivian launched the new ground-up driving software in 2024 on its second-generation R1 vehicles, which use Nvidia’s Orin processors. \nScaringe said it was only recently that his company started to see dramatic progress “once the data started really pouring in.”\nRivian is betting it can train its Large Driving Model (LDM) on fleet data so quickly that it will allow the company to roll out what it calls “Universal Hands-Free” later this month. That means Rivian owners will be able to take their hands off the wheel on 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada (so long as there are visible painted lines). In the back half of 2026, Rivian will allow “point-to-point” driving, or the consumer version of the demo we received Thursday.\nThe ‘eyes off’ to ‘hands off’ challenge\nBy the end of 2026, after Rivian has started shipping its smaller, more affordable R2 SUVs, it will ditch the Nvidia chips and outfit those vehicles with a new custom autonomy computer unveiled Thursday. That computer, plus a lidar sensor, will eventually allow drivers to take their hands and eyes off the road. True autonomy — where a driver doesn’t have to worry about re-taking control of the vehicle — lies well beyond that and will largely depend on how fast Rivian can train its LDM.\nThis rollout introduces a near-term challenge for Rivian. The new autonomy computer and lidar won’t be ready until months after the R2 goes on sale. If customers want a vehicle that can handle eyes-off driving (or more), they’ll have to wait. But the R2 is a crucial product for Rivian, and the company needs it to sell well — especially in the wake of declining sales of its first-generation vehicles.\n“When tech is moving as fast as it is, there’s always going to be some level of obsolescence, and so what we want to do here is to be really direct” about what’s coming, Scaringe said. The early R2s will still get Rivian’s promised “point-to-point” driving, which will be based on the new software and will be hands-off but not eyes-off.\n“So [if] you’re buying an R2 and you buy it in the first nine months, it’s just going to be more constrained,” he said. “I think what will happen is some customers will say ‘that matters a lot to me, and I’m going to wait.’ And some will say ‘I want the newest, best things now, and I’m going to get the R2 now, and maybe I’ll trade it in a year or two, and I’ll get the next version later. Fortunately, there’s so much demand backlog for R2 that we think, by being upfront with this, customers can make the decision themselves.”\n“In a perfect world, everything times at the same time, but the timeline of the vehicle and the timeline of the autonomy platform are just not perfectly aligned,” he said.\nWhen I first interviewed Scaringe in 2018, before Rivian even showed what its vehicles looked like, he shared a goal that still rattles around my head. He wanted to make Rivian’s vehicles so capable of driving themselves that: “if you go for a hike, and you start at one point and you finish at another point, you have the vehicle meet you at the end of the trail.”\nIt was the kind of pie-in-the-sky promise about self-driving cars that was all the rage seven years ago, but it stuck with me at least because it was something that felt true to Rivian’s whole brand of aspirational adventure.\nScaringe told me Thursday he still thinks it’s possible for Rivian to enable a use case like that in the next few years. It certainly won’t happen until the company tests and builds its more-capable R2 vehicles, which is at least a year away in a best-case scenario.\n“We could [do that]. It’s not been a huge focus,” he said. That could change as the company gets closer to level 4 autonomy, though, since by then the company will have its LDM trained on trickier roads without guiding features like lane lines.\n“Then, it becomes a bit of a like, what’s the ODD [operational design domain]? Dirt roads, off road? Easy,” he said. Just don’t expect a Rivian driving itself up Hell’s Gate in Moab.\n“We’re not putting any resources into rock crawling autonomously,” he said. “But in terms of getting to the trail head? For sure.”\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Rivian’s Universal Hands-Free update is coming later this month.\n"

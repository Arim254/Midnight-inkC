    "body": "\nChris Lehane is one of the best in the business at making bad news disappear. Al Gore’s press secretary during the Clinton years, Airbnb’s chief crisis manager through every regulatory nightmare from here to Brussels – Lehane knows how to spin. Now he’s two years into what might be his most impossible gig yet: as OpenAI’s VP of global policy, his job is to convince the world that OpenAI genuinely gives a damn about democratizing artificial intelligence while the company increasingly behaves like, well, every other tech giant that’s ever claimed to be different.\nI had 20 minutes with him on stage at the Elevate conference in Toronto earlier this week – 20 minutes to get past the talking points and into the real contradictions eating away at OpenAI’s carefully constructed image. It wasn’t easy or entirely successful. Lehane is genuinely good at his job. He’s likable. He sounds reasonable. He admits uncertainty. He even talks about waking up at 3 a.m. worried about whether any of this will actually benefit humanity.\nBut good intentions don’t mean much when your company is subpoenaing critics, draining economically depressed towns of water and electricity, and bringing dead celebrities back to life to assert your market dominance.\nThe company’s Sora problem is really at the root of everything else. The video generation tool launched last week with copyrighted material seemingly baked right into it. It was a bold move for a company already getting sued by the New York Times, the Toronto Star, and half the publishing industry. From a business and marketing standpoint, it was also brilliant. The invite-only app soared to the top of the App Store as people created digital versions of themselves, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; characters like Pikachu, Mario, and Cartman of “South Park”; and dead celebrities like Tupac Shakur.\nAsked what drove OpenAI’s decision to launch this newest version of Sora with these characters, Lehane gave me the standard pitch: Sora is a “general purpose technology” like electricity or the printing press, democratizing creativity for people without talent or resources. Even he – a self-described creative zero – can make videos now, he said on stage.\nWhat he danced around is that OpenAI initially “let” rights holders opt out of having their work used to train Sora, which is not how copyright use typically works. Then, after OpenAI noticed that people really liked using copyrighted images, it “evolved” toward an opt-in model. That’s not really iterating. That’s testing how much you can get away with. (And by the way, though the Motion Picture Association made some noise last week about legal threats, OpenAI appears to have gotten away with quite a lot.)\nNaturally, the situation brings to mind the aggravation of publishers who accuse OpenAI of training on their work without sharing the financial spoils. When I pressed Lehane about publishers getting cut out of the economics, he invoked fair use, that American legal doctrine that’s supposed to balance creator rights against public access to knowledge. He called it the secret weapon of U.S. tech dominance.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMaybe. But I’d recently interviewed Al Gore – Lehane’s old boss – and realized anyone could simply ask ChatGPT about it instead of reading my piece on TechCrunch. “It’s ‘iterative’,” I said, “but it’s also a replacement.”\nFor the first time, Lehane dropped his spiel. “We’re all going to need to figure this out,” he said. “It’s really glib and easy to sit here on stage and say we need to figure out new economic revenue models. But I think we will.” (We’re making it up as we go, in short.)\nThen there’s the infrastructure question nobody wants to answer honestly. OpenAI is already operating a data center campus in Abilene, Texas, and recently broke ground on a massive data center in Lordstown, Ohio, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. Lehane has likened accessibility to AI to the advent of electricity – saying those who accessed it last are still playing catch-up – yet OpenAI’s Stargate project is seemingly targeting some of those same economically challenged places as spots to set up facilities with their massive appetites for water and electricity.\nAsked during our sit-down whether these communities will benefit or merely foot the bill, Lehane went to gigawatts and geopolitics. OpenAI needs about a gigawatt of energy per week, he noted. China brought on 450 gigawatts last year plus 33 nuclear facilities. If democracies want democratic AI, they have to compete. “The optimist in me says this will modernize our energy systems,” he’d said, painting a picture of re-industrialized America with transformed power grids.\nIt was inspiring. But it was not an answer about whether people in Lordstown and Abilene are going to watch their utility bills spike while OpenAI generates videos of John F. Kennedy and The Notorious B.I.G. (Video generation is the most energy-intensive AI out there.)\nWhich brought me to my most uncomfortable example. Zelda Williams spent the day before our interview begging strangers on Instagram to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her late father, Robin Williams. “You’re not making art,” she wrote. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings.”\nWhen I asked about how the company reconciles this kind of intimate harm with its mission, Lehane answered by talking about processes, including responsible design, testing frameworks, and government partnerships. “There is no playbook for this stuff, right?”\nLehane showed vulnerability in some moments, saying that he wakes up at 3. a.m. every night, worried about democratization, geopolitics, and infrastructure. “There’s enormous responsibilities that come with this.”\nWhether or not those moments were designed for the audience, I believe him. Indeed, I left Toronto thinking I’d watched a master class in political messaging – Lehane threading an impossible needle while dodging questions about company decisions that, for all I know, he doesn’t even agree with. Then Friday happened.\nNathan Calvin, a lawyer who works on AI policy at a nonprofit advocacy organization, Encode AI, revealed that at the same time I was talking with Lehane in Toronto, OpenAI had sent a sheriff’s deputy to his house in Washington, D.C., during dinner to serve him a subpoena. They wanted his private messages with California legislators, college students, and former OpenAI employees.\nCalvin is accusing OpenAI of intimidation tactics around a new piece of AI regulation, California’s SB 53. He says the company weaponized its legal battle with Elon Musk as a pretext to target critics, implying Encode was secretly funded by Musk. In fact, Calvin says he fought OpenAI’s opposition to California’s SB 53, an AI safety bill, and that when he saw the company claim it “worked to improve the bill,” he “literally laughed out loud.” In a social media skein, he went on to call Lehane specifically the “master of the political dark arts.”\nIn Washington, that might be a compliment. At a company like OpenAI whose mission is “to build AI that benefits all of humanity,” it sounds like an indictment.\nWhat matters much more is that even OpenAI’s own people are conflicted about what they’re becoming.\nAs my colleague Max reported last week, a number of current and former employees took to social media after Sora 2 was released, expressing their misgivings, including Boaz Barak, an OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, who wrote about Sora 2 that it is “technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”\nOn Friday, Josh Achiam – OpenAI’s head of mission alignment – tweeted something even more remarkable about Calvin’s accusation. Prefacing his comments by saying they were “possibly a risk to my whole career,”  Achiam went on to write of OpenAI: “We can’t be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high.”\nThat’s . . .something. An OpenAI executive publicly questioning whether his company is becoming “a frightening power instead of a virtuous one,” isn’t on a par with a competitor taking shots or a reporter asking questions. This is someone who chose to work at OpenAI, who believes in its mission, and who is now acknowledging a crisis of conscience despite the professional risk.\nIt’s a crystallizing moment. You can be the best political operative in tech, a master at navigating impossible situations, and still end up working for a company whose actions increasingly conflict with its stated values – contradictions that may only intensify as OpenAI races toward artificial general intelligence.\nIt has me thinking that the real question isn’t whether Chris Lehane can sell OpenAI’s mission. It’s whether others – including, critically, the other people who work there – still believe it.\n"

He gushed about sitting across from Trump at a Windsor Castle state dinner, telling the president “how grateful I am for everything he’s doing.” He praised Elon Musk’s government efficiency efforts and said he hadn’t closely followed news about immigration raids or Trump’s attacks on the media.\nThe 50-minute conversation reportedly ended after Benioff turned to his public relations executive, apparently noticing her expression. “What about the political questions?” he could be heard asking. “Too spicy?”Though Benioff’s shift mirrors Silicon Valley’s broader accommodation of Trump, the exchange offered a rare glimpse of just how far that repositioning can go.

    "body": "\nIn a development born of the government shutdown, the SEC announced Thursday that companies can proceed with IPOs using an obscure automatic approval process, now with the added bonus of skipping pricing information entirely.\nWhat’s happening is that with 90% of SEC staff furloughed, startups can file their paperwork and have it automatically become effective after 20 days. This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.\nPut another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. \nCompanies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.\n"

Paradigm Ventures, CapitalG, and Coinbase Ventures also participated.\nKalshi also revealed that consumers in 140 countries can now make bets on its platform.\nThe prediction market is seeing a dramatic surge in activity: Kalshi is set to reach $50 billion in annualized trading volume, up significantly from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year, the New York Times reported.\nKalshi’s fundraise announcement follows one made just days earlier by archrival Polymarket, which revealed that it had secured an investment of up to $2 billion from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, at a pre-money valuation of $8 billion. The deal valued Polymarket at $8 billion pre-money, a monumental increase from its $1 billion valuation only two months earlier in August.\nBoth Kalshi and Polymarket rose to prominence last year, drawing significant attention for their prediction markets on the presidential election outcome.\nPolymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearing house. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market.

    "body": "\nEarlier this week, OpenAI launched a way for developers to build apps within ChatGPT, allowing users to prompt the assistant to perform tasks and answer questions directly related to the participating apps. \nSeveral companies have launched their interactive experiences, including Spotify, allowing listeners to ask ChatGPT to create playlists, recommend songs, and more. \nWhen you mention Spotify in your ChatGPT prompt, you’ll have the option to connect your account. A button that says “Use Spotify for this answer” will appear at the bottom of the page. Connecting your account allows the AI to access your data, such as your likes and listening history, providing relevant context that helps generate better answers.\nImage Credits:ChatGPT (screenshot)\nFrom there, you can ask it for recommendations for tracks, artists, playlists, or podcast episodes based on your tastes. \nYou can be as detailed as you want in your prompts. For instance, you can create a playlist with a specific mood in mind, choose the event you want the playlist for, or request to include only your most listened-to artists, your top favorite genre, and so on. It also asks you for the preferred length, which is helpful for planning a long road trip playlist.\nDuring our testing, we asked it to create a dog-walking playlist but all the songs needed to have “Dog” in the title. Here is what it came up with:\nImage Credits:Spotify (screenshot)\nTapping a suggested track or podcast episode will open the Spotify app, allowing you to listen or watch directly from there.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChatGPT also has the capability to perform actions on your behalf within Spotify, including controlling playback; adding and removing items from your library; creating, editing, and following private playlists; and managing your following list. \nIt’s important to note that when you’re connecting your Spotify account, you agree to the app’s privacy policy. \nThis policy includes important information about data sharing and security, stating that if ChatGPT experiences a security breach, there is a risk that your data could be accessed by unauthorized parties. In addition to giving ChatGPT access to data — such as what songs and podcasts you’re playing, what is saved in your Spotify library, and who you follow — you’re also providing your IP address and approximate location. \nHowever, you can disconnect your Spotify account at any time. \nAdditionally, Spotify explained in a blog post that it doesn’t share content from artists and creators with OpenAI for training purposes. All music, podcasts, or any other audio or video content on the platform stays protected.\nImage Credits:Spotify (screenshot)\nThe feature is available in English across 145 countries for all ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro users on web and mobile. \nBoth free and premium Spotify users can use the integration; however, the company says premium users get a more tailored experience. \nOther companies have also integrated their apps into ChatGPT, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, and Zillow. The integrations allow you to, for example, ask Coursera to teach you something or search on Zillow for apartments in your area within a specific price range.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe energy transition is seemingly under assault, with congressional Republicans killing tax credits for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to cancel billions of dollars’ worth of grants. \nBut there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.\nInvestor sentiment, judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: People and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.\nThis week, Brookfield, the Canadian infrastructure and asset management giant, announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. Brookfield has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.\nPerhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculate that clean energy was entering a bubble. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.\nAlso this week, Energy Impact Partners (EIP) announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early-stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.\nClimate tech — or whatever people are calling it these days — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became too hard to ignore for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early-stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlready, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and Quilt, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.\nInvesting trends that have developed over the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed nearly $1 trillion to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, according to PitchBook.\nIn the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. \nThe Trump administration is openly opposed to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised downward the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.\nDespite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expected to double by 2030, led by solar installations in China, India, the EU, and Subsaharan Africa.\nThe IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV expect that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. \nIt won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPrezent, a startup that offers an AI-powered presentation builder to enterprises, said today that it has raised $30 million in funding led by Multiplier Capital, Greycroft, and Nomura Strategic Ventures, with participation from existing investors like Emergent Ventures, WestWave Capital, and Alumni Ventures.\nThe Los Altos, California, startup, which is now valued at $400 million, has raised over $74 million to date. It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.\nThe company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nThere are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including Presentations.ai, Lica, Gamma, and Chronicle. Notably, all these companies have Accel as a backer. While most of them focus on consumers and small business users, Prezent wants to stick to an enterprise strategy, targeting larger corporations. Previously, the company stated that it wants to expand its offerings to different verticals, including finance and manufacturing. However, Mishra noted that for now, the company wants to focus on serving clients in the life sciences and tech industries.\n“There are plenty of tools that are trying to make presentations pretty. We want to provide the best tools for business communications. I think presentation is one of the frontiers in businesses that is not automated yet. We want to help data scientists and designers to communicate effectively with this automation,” Mishra told TechCrunch.\nPrezent founder Rajat MishraImage Credits:Prezent\nMishra, who previously worked at McKinsey, said that the company is taking a specialized approach to training AI models for presentations for each specific industry.\nPrezent places a presentation engineer, who is familiar with the industry and the startup’s own offerings, in enterprises to help different people within the company get used to building presentations with AI tools.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The reality of AI in enterprise is that while AI can do many things, it can’t teach people [how] to use AI. That is why we want to place presentation engineers in companies to help our customers adopt the product faster,” Mishra said.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nAI startups are looking to acquire services companies to take advantage of existing customer bases and also provide better customization to enterprise clients. Digital avatar startup D-ID acquired Berlin-based video startup Simpleshow, and Google-backed legal tech startup Lawhive acquired a U.K.-based law firm. With these acquisitions, AI startups want to combine their AI tools with the existing domain expertise and client service capabilities of services firms.\nPrezent wants to build more partnerships and acquire suitable companies in sectors like executive communication coaching, medical writing, and consulting firms in the communication area. \nMark Terbeek, a partner at Greycroft who has invested in multiple rounds in Prezent, said that the venture firm likes to find the areas where businesses have used costly agencies in the past to fulfill a need, and now there are AI tools available trying to do the same tasks.\n“We felt that Rajat and Prezent were concentrating hard on solving specific customer needs of business communications. Plus, we saw software evolve quickly to adjust to the workflows of end users and help them save time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nGoing forward, Prezent wants to add better personalization to its product so the AI tool learns the style of each individual in the organization. It also wants to add multimodality capabilities to deck creations, allowing users to use text, voice, or video as input to make presentations. Like Synthesia and D-ID, Prezent wants to add digital avatars to presentations, too.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

In 2023, he unveiled a £2.5 billion deal with Microsoft to invest in new data centers and training in the U.K.\nAcoba also noted that “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the U.K. government…given the ongoing debate about how to best regulate AI, and at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world on what the approach should be.” \nSunak said he would steer clear on advising on U.K. policy matters, stick to high-level perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends, and avoid lobbying. He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year. \nThe former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital. \nSunak isn’t the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs. Sunak’s senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, is also on Anthropic’s payroll. And former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg served as Meta’s president of global affairs until January 2025.   \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the United States, the revolving door between Silicon Valley and the U.S. government is ever-active.

    "body": "\nIt takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.\nBelow, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\nMicrosoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. \nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\nOpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.\nThe rise of Oracle\nOn June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. \nBut before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.\nNvidia’s investment spree\nAs AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.\nIf that seems circular, it should. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.\nBuilding tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers\nFor companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.\nIn just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. \nA new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. \nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.\nThe Stargate moonshot\nJust two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” \nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\nThis article was first published on September 22.\n"

    "body": "\nIsraeli spyware maker NSO Group has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company.  \nNSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz told TechCrunch on Friday that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.” \nConfirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website Calcalist reported Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  \nHershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are.  \n“This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,” said Hershowitz. “The company’s headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” \n(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is publishing the responses as there was no agreement made.) \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you know more information about this deal? Or about NSO Group and other spyware makers?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nIn 2023, The Guardian reported that Simonds and an associate, through their investment firm, were exploring making a bid to take control of NSO. The deal never materialized. \nCalcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO’s co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie’s involvement with the spyware maker will end. \nLavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either. \nFrom a U.S. ban to U.S. ownership \nNSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning. \nResearchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, have for years documented dozens of cases where NSO’s government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others.  \nNSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company was caught in 2021 targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad. \nSoon after, the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has tried to get off the U.S. government’s blocklist, as recently as May 2025, with the help of a lobbying firm tied to the Trump administration.  \nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO’s spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition. \n“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds.  \n“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities. This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.” \nNSO’s ownership has exchanged hands before.  \nOriginally founded by Niv Karmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, NSO Group was acquired by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014. Lavie and Hulio retook control of the company in 2019 with help from European private equity firm Novalpina. Then, in 2021, the California-based Berkeley Research Group took over management of the fund. In 2023, Lavie retook control of NSO as majority owner.  \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn’t be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can’t believe something just because you saw a video of it.\nThe Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the Bloomberg Screentime conference this week. At the interview’s start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators’ livelihoods and said it was “scary times” for the industry.\nMosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won’t be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.\n“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they’re going to do is they’re going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true financial, environmental, and human costs of using AI, which are substantial.)\nIn addition, the exec suggested that there’s already a lot of “hybrid” content on today’s big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what’s real and what’s AI generated will become even more blurred.\n“It’s going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there’s gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.\nAs things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn’t the “right focus” and was practically “a fool’s errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was labeling real content as AI, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.\nWhile he didn’t elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta’s Community Notes feature, which is the crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year, modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It’s likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn’t been labeled as such.\nRather than saying it was fully the platform’s responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. \n“My kids are young. They’re nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they’re seeing a video of something doesn’t mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. \n“What they’re going to … need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)\nIn the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for a dedicated TV app and its newer focus on Reels and DMs as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok’s changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.\nOn the latter, he said that, ultimately, it’s better to have competition, as TikTok’s U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it’s hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” \n“It’s the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you’re following — the same people. It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. \n"

    "body": "\nUber Eats is partnering with sidewalk delivery robot company Starship Technologies to deliver food in the U.K. starting later this year.\nThe companies will start the service in the Leeds and Sheffield areas “from select merchants” in December and expand from there. Uber said the service will expand to “additional European markets in 2026” and the U.S. in 2027. \nThe tie-up with Starship is the latest in an increasingly long line of partnerships Uber has struck with autonomous vehicle companies of all shapes and sizes. But Starship’s not the first sidewalk robot company to work with Uber Eats. Uber’s food delivery arm has used Serve Robotics’ robots for a few years in the U.S. Uber started using Avride’s sidewalk robots earlier this year, too.\nStarship claims to have nearly 3,000 of its six-wheeled delivery robots in operation around the world, across more than 270 different locations. The robots typically make deliveries in under 30 minutes and travel no more than two miles.\n"

    "body": "\nSpotify is making it easier for users to make the switch from other streaming services. On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic, a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users’ Spotify libraries.\nThe new feature, which is rolling out now to all Spotify users, will be found in the “Your Library” section of the Spotify mobile app. To use TuneMyMusic, you’ll scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap on the new option to “Import your music” and follow the prompts to connect with the service.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nYou can then choose the platform you’d like to transfer playlists from, and they’ll appear in your Spotify library. \nTo be clear, this process doesn’t delete the original playlists — it only copies them over to Spotify. At launch, TuneMyMusic supports transferring playlists from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube Music, and others.\nThe addition of the new feature ramps up the competition in the streaming wars, while also serving as a win for data portability. \nScreenshotImage Credits:Spotify\nOne of Spotify’s top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that’s built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app. That option is also available within the Android version of the Apple Music app.\nYouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well.\nFor customers thinking of switching to Spotify, having the transfer feature built into Spotify could push them to make the jump. It’s a nice perk, too, since the online version of TuneMyMusic only offers to transfer 500 tracks for free. For unlimited transfers, users would have to upgrade to a paid plan. \nSpotify isn’t sharing the terms of its deal with TuneMyMusic, but it’s likely a win for both companies, as it could bring more customers to Spotify while TuneMyMusic snags a large client. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIf you want insight into just how worried VCs (and Silicon Valley, generally) are over legal challenges to AI training on copyrighted material, look no further than AI music site Suno. \nSuno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \nThe company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal. \nIt previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. \nBut Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  \nThose types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. \nBut given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. \n“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in their blog post about the investment.\nMenlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth — people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. \nNo doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.\n"

    "body": "\nIndian IT giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has secured $1 billion from private equity firm TPG as part of a multi-year, $2 billion project to build a network of gigawatt-scale data centers in the country.\nThe project, dubbed “HyperVault,” comes as demand for AI compute is rising faster than companies can build the power-hungry infrastructure needed to support it.\nThe demand-supply gap for AI compute in India is particularly stark: the country generates nearly 20% of the world’s data, but accounts for only about 3% of global data center capacity. Big tech companies and cloud providers have been investing billions of dollars to expand local capacity and tap the country’s growing adoption of AI products.\nWith HyperVault, TCS and TPG plan to develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers with the power and network capacity required to support advanced AI workloads across major cloud regions, the companies said.\nLiquid cooling and high-density rack designs are growing common as the GPUs needed to power AI inference and training use significantly more power and generate more heat than conventional CPU servers. But such designs also raise questions about resource use in countries like India, where water scarcity is already a concern. \nIn urban hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, where much of India’s data-center capacity is concentrated, existing water stress could complicate operations. S&P Global, citing Uptime Institute estimates, noted that a 1-MW data center load can require up to 25.5 million liters of water a year for cooling, adding pressure to already strained infrastructure.\nThe rapid building of AI data centers stands to further stress India’s power and land use, two other bottlenecks identified by industry analysts. High-density AI clusters require reliable electricity supply and large parcels of industrial land, two requirements increasingly difficult to secure in major urban regions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNonetheless, global tech companies are treating India as their frontier for building AI infrastructure. Local and global technology firms have announced investments of more than $32 billion over the last two years to expand data center infrastructure in the country, according to S&P Global.\nIn January, Microsoft said it would invest $3 billion over two years in India’s cloud and AI infrastructure, and in  October, Google said it would spend $15 billion over five years to build a gigawatt-scale AI data center hub in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. And back in 2023, Amazon committed $12.7 billion to build AWS cloud infrastructure in India through 2030.\nTCS said it would work with hyperscalers and AI companies to design, deploy and operate AI infrastructure as the platform expands. The company plans to build around 1.2 gigawatts of capacity in its initial phase.\nMore than 95% of India’s new data-center capacity over the next five years will come from leased facilities, and the remainder will be driven by hyperscalers building dedicated AI infrastructure, S&P Global estimates. Local players like Reliance Industries and CtrlS are also expanding their data-center capacity to meet rising demand.\nTCS and TPG project that India’s total data-center capacity could exceed 10 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 1.5 gigawatts today.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle is upgrading its image generation model with new editing chops, higher resolutions, more accurate text rendering, and the ability to search the web.\nDubbed Nano Banana Pro, the new model is built on Google’s latest large language model, Gemini 3, released earlier this week. The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts and languages.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe model also has web searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards.\nGoogle says Nano Banana Pro is geared towards giving professionals more control over images, and lets users  control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. And compared to Nano Banana’s resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro.\nThe company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities.\nNano Banana Pro is being rolled out across many of Google’s existing AI tools. The Gemini app will now use the new model to generate images by default, though users on the free subscription tier will be able to use the model to generate a limited number of images, after which they will be defaulted to the original Nano Banana model. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers will get higher generation thresholds, though the company did not disclose the exact limits.

    "body": "\nWaymo has three new cities in its sights as it continues to expand around the United States: Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa.\nThe company said on Thursday that it will start manually driving its vehicles in those cities “in the coming days,” ahead of testing and validating its driverless tech, before eventually launching a commercial robotaxi service in each.\nThese cities join a growing list of locations where Waymo has launched or plans to launch its robotaxis. The Alphabet-owned company is already offering rides on surface streets and highways in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, and is live in Austin and Atlanta as well. \nIn 2026, Waymo plans to expand to Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City, and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo.\nThe new cities announced Thursday could present some unique challenges for Waymo, though. Minneapolis has perhaps the harshest winters of the cities Waymo has chosen to date. Snow could challenge Waymo’s perception stack, and the lack of traction will give its automated driving system some extra work to do. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a lot of tight, one-way streets that are heavily used by pedestrians — especially in the French Quarter.\nAs Waymo has expanded, it’s been working with partners in a number of cities to help operate its fleets. Its vehicles are on Uber’s app in Austin and Atlanta; African mobility and fintech company Moove took over operations in Phoenix (and will do the same in Miami), and Avis Budget Group will manage the fleet in Dallas. It’s not immediately clear if Waymo will lean on similar partnerships in the new cities.\nWaymo’s so far outpacing other players when it comes to expanding to new cities. Amazon-owned Zoox is offering free rides in its custom-built robotaxi in Las Vegas, and letting members of its early-rider program take trips in San Francisco while it awaits a necessary exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch full commercial operations. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla, meanwhile, is trying to expand its nascent robotaxi service, which still has safety monitors in the driver’s seat.

    "body": "\nFinnish startup NestAI has raised €100 million (about $115 million) in a funding round led by Finland’s sovereign fund, Tesi, and hardware giant Nokia to build AI products for use in unmanned vehicles, autonomous operations, and command and control platforms.\nNestAI has also struck a partnership with Nokia to build AI products for defense applications and develop “physical AI,” which involves using large language models and related technology for robotics and other real-world applications.\nThe funding will help NestAI build “Europe’s leading physical AI lab,” co-founder Peter Sarlin said at the Slush 2025 technology conference in Helsinki. \nPhysical AI has been a growing research field both for Big Tech and startups, and NestAI’s funding round shows there’s space for European companies to develop homegrown solutions to address the continent’s needs — which have leaned towards defense applications due to prolonged Ukraine-Russia war. Last month, the startup announced it would support the Finnish Defense Forces in adopting AI.\nThis focus on sovereignty may explain why NestAI has been in stealth so far, but it is now building in public, supported by Sarlin, who has been funding the venture for the past few months through his family office, PostScriptum.\n“In line with PostScriptum’s mission, NestAI has from the start set out to become Europe’s leading physical AI lab to drive technological sovereignty,” Sarlin told TechCrunch. “This partnership also marks an important step in securing Europe’s defense capabilities and sovereignty.”\nAfter selling AI startup Silo AI to AMD for $665 million last year, Sarlin has been active as a philanthropist and investor, backing startups like Legora and Lovable. While he’s building NestAI, his day job is still at AMD, and he will only act as the startup’s chairman, not its CEO. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNestAI doesn’t have a CEO yet, but its growing team has attracted talent with experience in AI research and hardware projects that overlap with defense.

    "body": "\nVoice AI company Wispr’s dictation app, Wispr Flow, is seeing great traction. The startup said that, after three months of usage, an average user writes more than 50% of their characters through the app. The company has also reached 270 of the Fortune 500 companies and has signed 125 companies as enterprise customers.\nThat’s why, after just raising a $30 million round led by Menlo Ventures in June, the company has now raised an additional $25 million led by Notable Capital with participation from Steven Bartlett’s Flight Fund, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. With this influx of capital, the company has raised $81 million in total.\nNotable’s Hans Tung, who has backed companies like Affirm, Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Anthropic, and TikTok, is joining Wispr’s board as an observer. \nWispr’s CEO Tanay Kothari said that, since June, Wispr Flow has grown 40% month-over-month. Plus, the product has been quite popular within the VC community. And because of that, the company started getting a lot of inbound investor interest. (Granola is another such example of this trend).\n“We were still not planning to raise anytime soon because we had a really long runway and the team’s really lean. But when I heard from Hans and Steven, it made sense to put something together to bring them on,” Kothari told TechCrunch.\nKothari added that when Notable’s team, including investor Chelcie Taylor, presented to him, they had done deep research, interviews with competitors, and had built a strong case about investing in Wispr.\nImage Credits: Wispr\nKothari said the company is now thinking about international growth and new product opportunities. With the additional funding, the startup would be able to hire top machine learning talent that might otherwise go to a company like OpenAI or Anthropic.\nThe CEO is pleased with user growth and said that the company is at 100x user base year-over-year with 70% retention over 12 months.\nHowever, he recalled there was a time when the startup noticed a dip as more non-technical people discovered the app. Those people installed the app, tried out the dictation feature within the app, and then dropped off. The problem was that there was no clear guidance to indicate that they could use the dictation in other apps, too. To address this, the startup created a design flow for new users to guide them to use dictation in the apps they use the most.\n\n\n\nWispr also wants the Flow app to be available on more surfaces apart from Windows, Mac, and iOS. The company is working on an Android app with a beta version slated to be out by year-end, followed by a stable version launch in Q1 2025.\nThe company also wants to invest in building its own voice models to understand users better with personalized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It aims to reduce the number of edits the users have to make after they dictate through Flow. Currently, its error rate is around 10%, lower than 27% for OpenAI’s Whisper and 47% for Apple’s native transcription, it claims.\nImage Credits: Wispr\nWispr is not thinking of expanding beyond consumer applications immediately, but it is testing its technology through a closed API with select enterprises and hardware partners and expects to open it up to more developers next year. \nWhile Wispr has received more VC attention, there are other apps that are competing with it too in the dictation space, including YC-backed Willow and Aqua;  Monologue, which is part of Every’s subscription bundle; along with Typeless Talktastic, Superwhisper, and Betterdictation.\nWispr wants to be more than a dictation tool by automating some of the tasks, like replying to emails.\n“What I really like about Wispr is that they are trying to be more than a dictation app and become like a voice-led operating system that can initiate workflow automation. The quality of the people they have recruited and the speed at which they interact have impressed me a lot since we met them,” Notable’s Tung told TechCrunch over a call. \nHe added that, as he has invested in apps with a great interface and user experiences that scale well, he also sees that potential in Wispr Flow.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang struck a bullish tone in the company’s third-quarter earnings. And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to.\nNvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations.\nThe revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive.\nNvidia’s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs.\n“This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said.\nBlackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company. \nHuang said sales of its Blackwell GPU chips “are off the charts.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Huang said in the company’s Q3 earnings statement. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”\nKress did note that the company’s shipments of H20, a data center GPU designed for generative AI and high-performance computing, were 50 million, a disappointing result due to its inability to sell to China.\n“Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,,” Kress noted on the earnings call. “While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America’s ability to compete around the world.” \nImportantly, Nvidia is forecasting more growth with a projected revenue of $65 billion in the fourth quarter, helping push its share price up more than 4% in after-hours trading. \nThe upshot, at least in Huang’s view: forget about the bubble, there is only growth. \n“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Jensen said during the company’s earnings call. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nFrom electronic health records and blood tests to the stream of data from wearable devices, the amount of health information people generate is accelerating rapidly. Yet, many users struggle to connect this trove of data in a meaningful way and actually use it to improve their health.\nFunction Health, which offers a regular lab testing service to help people track their health, wants to change that by consolidating health data and making it usable for its customers by connecting that data to an AI model. To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. \nThe funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million.\nAlongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research. The company said the model is trained by doctors. For its customers, the company is offering an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on their health data and can tap their previous lab results, doctor’s notes, and scans to provide tailored guidance.\n“It is not good enough to be in a world where AI exists and not be applying it to your health,” Jonathan Swerdlin, CEO and co-founder of Function, told TechCrunch. “You should be able to manage your biology. The objective of Function Health is to apply the best available technology to human health.”\nSwerdlin noted the platform meets HIPAA standards, fully encrypts user data, and never sells personal information. “Your data and your identity are never for sale. Every bit of your information is fully encrypted and protected. We are committed to keeping you, and your data, safe.”\nFunction’s chief medical scientist, Dr. Dan Sodickson, and its co-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Mark Hyman, are together leading development of MI Lab and its team of doctors, researchers, and engineers. The MI model is trained by doctors and they stay involved in the process, Swerdlin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the space has many players, Function sets itself apart from competitors like Superpower, Neko Health, and InsideTracker thanks to its device-agnostic approach, Swerdlin said, adding that the platform integrates lab testing, diagnostics, and clinical insights to offer more than a typical AI coach or wellness app.\nFunction members “can get lab tests done at 2,000 Quest locations”, he added. Function says it has completed more than 50 million lab tests since 2023.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that Function members can access tests at 2,000 quest locations. \n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nSpotify has acquired the community-run database tracking sampled music, WhoSampled, the company announced Wednesday. The streaming service had also shared the news as part of its Wednesday blog post about new song credits features.\nDeal terms were not disclosed, but Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch the acquisition is for both the WhoSampled team and database. (The company had only a handful of employees, per data on PitchBook and LinkedIn, which both confirm around 10 staffers.)\nLaunched in 2008, London-based WhoSampled offers an extensive database of songs, samples, covers, remixes, artists, and more.

    "body": "\nWarner Music Group (WMG) has settled a copyright infringement case with AI music startup Udio, the label announced on Wednesday. The two have also entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026.\nIn its press release, WMG said that the “next-generation music creation, listening, and discovery platform” will be powered by generative AI models trained on licensed and authorized music.\nThe company says the platform will create “new revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.”\nThe subscription service will allow users to make remixes, covers, and new songs using the voices of artists and compositions of songwriters who choose to participate. Warner Music Group says the platform will ensure artists and songwriters are credited and compensated.\n“We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “This collaboration aligns with our broader efforts to responsibly unlock AI’s potential — fueling new creative and commercial possibilities while continuing to deliver innovative experiences for fans.”\nArtists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more. \n“This partnership is a crucial step towards realizing a future in which technology amplifies creativity and unlocks new opportunities for artists and songwriters,” said Udio co-founder and CEO Andrew Sanchez in the press release. “Our new platform will enable experiences where fans can create alongside their favorite artists and make extraordinary music in an environment that offers artists control and connection.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement marks a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI.

    "body": "\nAutonomous electric tractor startup Monarch Tractor warned staff Thursday it may need to lay off more than 100 employees, or possibly even ‘shut down,’ according to a company-wide memo obtained by TechCrunch.\nThe memo comes after Monarch Tractor was already cutting some positions over the last few weeks at its California corporate facilities and remote teams in India and Singapore, according to multiple former employees who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity.\nMonarch Tractor was founded in 2018 by a team that included a former top executive at Tesla’s first gigafactory and Carlo Mondavi, a scion of the famous winemaking family. The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms.\nWhile Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company announced a restructuring in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech.\nAt least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, according to a lawsuit first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.)\nMonarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, earlier this year.\n“The new business plan will enable Monarch customers to launch fully commercialized software as a service (SaaS) autonomy and other software offerings direct to consumers, unlocking new revenue streams to OEMs,” the startup’s human resources team wrote. “Unfortunately, the timing for completing the transition to the new business plan puts Monarch at risk of shut down.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMonarch told employees in the memo it may permanently lay off “up to 102 employees.”\n“In 2025, over 70% of Monarch’s revenue came from licensing, and this segment is expected to grow further in 2026” Penmesta told TechCrunch in an email Wednesday. He did not share an overall revenue figure. \n“Investors are showing interest in Monarch’s technology for next-generation smart off-highway equipment, leveraging its cost-efficient hardware and field experience. The WARN notice reflects this shift in our teams and resources toward revenue-generating segments,” he said of the official layoff notice to the state.\nIt’s unclear how many people currently work for Monarch. The startup had around 300 employees in late 2024 when it laid off more than 10% of the company as part of the restructuring. The former employees familiar with the recent cuts could not say exactly how large those layoffs were. \nThrough this year, Monarch Tractor has also lost some top talent, including the co-founder from Tesla, Mark Schwager. \n“We started Monarch with a daring vision: that farming could be electrified, automated, smart and made more profitable — all at once,” Schwager wrote in a LinkedIn post in July, while explaining he would remain on the company’s board. “Monarch is in great position and in great hands for the next leg of its trajectory – making the timing right for this transition.”\nThis story has been updated with a response from Monarch Tractor’s CEO.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

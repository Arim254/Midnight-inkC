This change alone could push spammy websites that push a lot of notifications to reconsider how many they want to send alerts, so they won’t lose access entirely.</p>\n<p>Unwanted notifications have been an issue facing consumers for years. On the iPhone, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/\">Apple was forced to add controls</a> that let users send their push notifications to a daily summary, mute them, or turn them off altogether from the notification message itself, after <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-your-push-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\">consumer</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/tim-cook-wants-you-to-put-down-your-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">frustrations</a> with the notification system grew.</p>\n<p>Google says it will inform users when it’s removing notification permissions, allowing users to change the setting back, if they prefer. If users would rather Google didn’t intervene, they can also opt to turn off this auto-revocation feature altogether, the company notes. </p>\n<p>The feature had been in testing ahead of today’s official launch. Google found that these changes didn’t significantly impact the total number of clicks on notifications, an indication that people weren’t really engaging much with these pop-ups to begin with.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.</p>\n<p>Put another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. </p>\n<p>Companies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has pushed back on local media reports suggesting it plans to open an office in India, with a general partner calling the coverage “entirely fake news.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Indian media outlets <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/a16z-andreessen-horowitz-india-expansion-bengaluru-ai-saas-startups-11759839746933.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that a16z was preparing to establish a physical presence in the country by setting up an office in Bengaluru. The reports, which cited unnamed sources, also said the firm was in the process of hiring a local partner.</p>\n<p>However, Anish Acharya, a Bay Area-based general partner at a16z who has spent the last six years with the firm, dismissed the reports. “As much as I adore India and the many impressive founders+investors in the region, this is entirely fake news!” he <a href=\"https://x.com/illscience/status/1976363023133725168\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n<p>When contacted, an a16z spokesperson confirmed Acharya’s statement and referred to his post.</p>\n<p>The denial comes as a16z appears to be scaling back some of its international ambitions. Earlier this year, the firm decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/documents-show-uk-wooed-a16z-for-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\">shut down its London office</a> — which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/london-lures-a16zs-first-international-office-with-predictable-crypto-regs/\" target=\"_blank\">opened in 2023</a> after the U.K. government reportedly spent <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/andreessen-horowitz-london-office\" target=\"_blank\">five years</a> trying to woo the powerhouse firm, according to the outlet Sifted. The closure came just 18 months after a16z set up shop, with the firm citing a shift in strategy and more favorable regulatory developments back home. The firm said, however, that it would continue to invest internationally through remote teams and local networks. Reports later indicated that several of its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/a16z-has-venture-scouts-scattered-across-europe/\">scouts were active across Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, India has not been a major focus for a16z — unlike other U.S. venture firms such as Accel, General Catalyst, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which have made deep inroads into the market. The firm’s only notable bet in India has been crypto exchange CoinSwitch, which it backed as part of the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/\" target=\"_blank\">$260 million funding round</a> in 2021.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, a16z was reportedly seeking to invest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\" target=\"_blank\">about $500 million in Indian startups</a>, though it has not made any major investments in the country since.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As TechCrunch has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\">previously noted</a>, a16z co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen delivered a talk at Stanford Graduate School of Business many years ago, saying while it is “extremely tempting” to back startups in emerging markets, it is also challenging for a venture fund to expand to more countries. Venture capital is a “very hands-on process of understanding the people you’re working with for both evaluating the company and work[ing] with the company,” he said at the time.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

He promised this is the “first of many” such Nvidia AI factories that will be deployed across Microsoft Azure’s global data centers to run OpenAI workloads.</p>\n<p>Each system is a cluster of more than 4,600 Nvidia GB300 rack computers sporting the much-in-demand Blackwell Ultra GPU chip and connected via Nvidia’s super-fast networking tech called InfiniBand. (Besides AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also had the foresight to corner the market on InfiniBand when his company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/\">acquired Mellanox</a> for $6.9 billion in 2019.)</p>\n<p>Microsoft promises that it will be deploying “hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs” as it rolls out these systems globally. While the size of these systems is eye-popping (and the company shared plenty <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/behind-the-cloud-understanding-datacenters-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">more technical details</a> for hardware enthusiasts to peruse), the timing of this announcement is also noteworthy.</p>\n<p>It comes just after OpenAI, its partner and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">well-documented frenemy</a>, inked two high-profile data center deals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/\">with Nvidia and AMD</a>. In 2025, OpenAI has racked up, by some estimates, $1 trillion in commitments to build its own data centers. And CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/even-after-stargate-oracle-nvidia-and-amd-openai-has-more-big-deals-coming-soon-sam-altman-says/\">Sam Altman said this week that more were coming</a>.</p>\n<p>Microsoft clearly wants the world to know that it already has the data centers — <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/behind-the-cloud-understanding-datacenters-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 300</a> in 34 countries — and that they are “uniquely positioned” to “meet the demands of frontier AI today,” the company said. These monster AI systems are also capable of running the next generation of models with “hundreds of trillions of parameters,” it said.</p>\n<p>We expect to hear more about how Microsoft is ramping up to serve AI workloads later this month. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott will be speaking at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, which will be held October 27 to October 29 in San Francisco. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner.

We want to help data scientists and designers to communicate effectively with this automation,” Mishra told TechCrunch.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rajat-Head-Shot-Q3-2025.png?resize=50,50 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Prezent founder Rajat Mishra</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Prezent</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mishra, who previously worked at McKinsey, said that the company is taking a specialized approach to training AI models for presentations for each specific industry.</p>\n<p>Prezent places a presentation engineer, who is familiar with the industry and the startup’s own offerings, in enterprises to help different people within the company get used to building presentations with AI tools.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“The reality of AI in enterprise is that while AI can do many things, it can’t teach people [how] to use AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Israeli spyware maker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\" target=\"_blank\">NSO Group</a> has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company.  </p>\n<p>NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz told TechCrunch on Friday that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.” </p>\n<p>Confirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website <a href=\"https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1jgvmitgx#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\">Calcalist reported</a> Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  </p>\n<p>Hershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are.  </p>\n<p>“This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,” said Hershowitz. “The company’s headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” </p>\n<p>(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance.

The deal never materialized. </p>\n<p>Calcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO’s co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie’s involvement with the spyware maker will end. </p>\n<p>Lavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-from-a-u-s-ban-to-u-s-ownership-nbsp\">From a U.S. ban to U.S. ownership </h2>\n<p>NSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning. </p>\n<p>Researchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, <a href=\"https://github.com/GranittHQ/data-pegasus-victims/blob/main/data-pegasus-victims.csv\" target=\"_blank\">have for years documented dozens of cases</a> where NSO’s government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others.  </p>\n<p>NSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/27/spyware-diplomats-us-pegasus/\" target=\"_blank\">was caught in 2021</a> targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad. </p>\n<p>Soon after, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. Commerce Department banned</a> American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/20/nso-group-pegasus-trump-eo/\" target=\"_blank\">tried to get off the U.S. government’s blocklist,</a> as recently as May 2025, with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/\" target=\"_blank\">the help of a lobbying firm</a> tied to the Trump administration.  </p>\n<p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO’s spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition. </p>\n<p>“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds.  </p>\n<p>“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities. This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.” </p>\n<p>NSO’s ownership has exchanged hands before.  </p>\n<p>Originally founded by Niv Karmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, NSO Group was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/12/01/this-spy-tool-can-find-you-with-just-a-telephone-number-and-25-countries-own-it-warn-researchers/?sh=7d4b92b6331e\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The energy transition is seemingly under assault, with congressional Republicans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/final-gop-bill-kneecaps-renewables-and-hydrogen-but-lifts-nuclear-and-geothermal/\">killing tax credits</a> for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/trumps-doe-proposes-cutting-billions-in-grants-for-gm-ford-and-lots-of-startups/\">cancel billions of dollars’ worth of grants</a>. </p>\n<p>But there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.</p>\n<p>Investor sentiment, which judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: People and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.</p>\n<p>This week, Brookfield announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. The infrastructure investor has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculate that clean energy was <a href=\"https://www.energyconnects.com/news/renewables/2021/november/green-investing-may-be-a-bubble-jeremy-grantham-says-but-he-s-doubling-down/\" target=\"_blank\">entering a bubble</a>. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.</p>\n<p>Also this week, Energy Impact Partners (EIP) announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early-stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>Climate tech — or whatever people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/21/if-climate-tech-is-dead-what-comes-next/\">are calling it these days</a> — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/climate-investors-canada-wildfires/\">too hard to ignore</a> for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early-stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Already, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\">Quilt</a>, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Investing trends that have developed over the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/large-funds-are-too-invested-in-the-energy-transition-to-turn-back-now/\">nearly $1 trillion</a> to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/research-center/report/60abbe3b-aa8d-3f41-98e3-e9093b0f2d3a\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">openly opposed</a> to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2025\">revised downward</a> the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.</p>\n<p>Despite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expected to double by 2030, led by solar installations in China, India, the EU, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/zeno-emerges-from-stealth-to-crib-teslas-master-plan-for-africa-and-beyond/\">Subsaharan Africa</a>.</p>\n<p>The IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV <a href=\"https://www.dnv.com/eto2025/\" target=\"_blank\">expect</a> that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. </p>\n<p>It won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

It does not cover the Google News app and website, and search syndication services are also out of scope.</p>\n<p>The CMA, however, noted that while Google’s Gemini AI assistant isn’t covered by the designation at the moment, it will review the scope of the designation given uncertainty over how the AI search market is evolving. </p>\n<p>The regulator said it would launch a consultation on possible interventions later this year.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The move follows a nine-month <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uks-cma-slaps-google-search-and-its-90-market-share-with-an-antitrust-investigation/\">investigation</a> into the company launched earlier this year after the U.K.’s new digital markets competition regime came into force in January. The CMA was looking to prove if Google is enabling weak competition and “barriers to entry and innovation in search”; whether the company prefers its own services over those offered by third parties; and if it uses consumer data without their explicit consent. </p>\n<p>The CMA’s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6859810eeaa6f6419fade671/Roadmap_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> of possible enforcement actions may include: enabling U.K. residents to choose and switch search engines via choice screens; implementing data portability systems; enforcing fair ranking of search results; ensuring proper attribution of publishers’ work in search; and enabling consent mechanisms for Google’s AI services.</p>\n<p>Google, for its part, says that any interventions following the designation would harm innovation in the U.K. “The UK enjoys access to the latest products and services before other countries because it has so far avoided costly restrictions on popular services, such as Search. Retaining this position means avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions, which have cost businesses an estimated €114 billion,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/cma-designation-google-search/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation. Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers,” it added.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Famed roboticist and iRobot founder Rodney Brooks has sounded the alarm on a humanoid robot investment bubble. He’s not the only one.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://rodneybrooks.com/why-todays-humanoids-wont-learn-dexterity/\" target=\"_blank\">recent essay</a>, Brooks calls out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/famed-roboticist-says-humanoid-robot-bubble-is-doomed-to-burst/\">billions of venture dollars being poured into humanoid robot companies</a> like Figure. His take: Despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won’t be able to learn dexterity — or the fine motor movements with hands — rendering them essentially useless.</p>\n<p>His take might surprise some, especially those VCs investing in the sector. But not the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/we-are-entering-a-golden-age-of-robotics-startups-and-not-just-because-of-ai/\">multiple robotics-focused VCs</a> and AI scientists who have told TechCrunch in recent months that they don’t expect to see wide adoption of humanoid robots for at least a few years — if not more than a decade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-issues\">The issues</h2>\n<p>Fady Saad, a general partner at robotics-focused VC Cybernetix Ventures and former co-founder of MassRobotics, told TechCrunch that beyond sending humanoids into space in place of human astronauts, he doesn’t see a huge market yet.</p>\n<p>“People who probably haven’t seen humanoids before, or haven’t kind of been closely following what’s happening, they are impressed with what’s happening now in humanoids, but we continue to be a little bit conservative and skeptical about the actual use case and the actual revenues that will be generated,” Saad said.</p>\n<p>Saad is also concerned about safety, especially when humans and humanoid robots share the same space. Safety issues could arise from humanoids and humans working closely on a factory floor, or other industrial sites. Saad says those concerns mount when humanoids enter people’s homes — a goal many humanoid companies are working toward.</p>\n<p>“If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them,” Saad said. “This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to. The other thing is, how many people are comfortable with having a humanoid in their home sitting there? What if it got hacked? What if it went crazy at night and started breaking things?”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The timeline for this technology also isn’t clear — a crucial factor for VCs who have fund lifecycles and timelines to return capital to investors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-timeline\">The timeline</h2>\n<p>Sanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, told TechCrunch in August that while it’s hard to pin the development of humanoids to an exact timeline, she compared the current swell of interest to the excitement in the early days of self-driving cars.</p>\n<p>“I mean, look at self-driving cars, in 2017 and 2016, I mean it felt tangible, right?” Fidler said at the time. “It still took them quite a few years to really scale and even now, no one really scaled to the entire world, full autonomy. It’s hard. It’s really hard to go and fully delivery on that technology.”</p>\n<p>Nvidia chief scientist Bill Dally agreed in an interview with TechCrunch. Dally and Fidler’s comments are especially notable as Nvidia is also pouring money into developing the infrastructure for humanoid companies to follow.</p>\n<p>Seth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said while it can be easy to get excited as each new technological development happens, or the latest demo drops, humanoids are incredibly complicated. He added that it will be a while before they reach their full capabilities.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to do software releases to six degrees of freedom systems; what we’re talking about with some of these humanoids is 60-plus degrees of freedom systems,” Winterroth said, regarding a robot’s ability to move on a 3D axis. “Then you need to be able to have good unit economics around that solution, such that you’ve got strong gross margin, such that you can be building an enduring business. I think we’re pretty early.”</p>\n<p>In most cases, humanoid robots aren’t ready for the world yet, either.</p>\n<p>Tesla is a great example of the struggles companies are running into. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/\">company announced it was building its humanoid</a>, Optimus, back in 2021. The following year, Tesla said the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/our-top-4-tesla-ai-day-predictions/\">bot would be introduced in 2023</a>.</p>\n<p>That didn’t happen. When the bot was introduced in 2024 at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event, it was revealed later that the bots were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/tesla-optimus-bots-were-controlled-by-humans-during-the-we-robot-event/\">largely being controlled by humans</a> off scene. The company claims it will start selling the bots in 2026.</p>\n<p>Robotics startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">Figure, which was valued at $39 billion</a> in a September fundraise, has also <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/04/06/figure-ai-bmw-humanoid-robot-partnership-details-reality-exaggeration/\" target=\"_blank\">drawn skepticism regarding how many of its humanoids</a> the company has actually deployed, a claim the company staunchly defends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-working\">What is working</h2>\n<p>That doesn’t mean humanoids won’t have a future market or that the technology is not worth working on.</p>\n<p>Brooks himself said he doesn’t doubt that we will have humanoids in the future. But instead of what the market pictures when they hear humanoids, a robot with a human form, he predicts they’ll likely have wheels and other inhuman features and won’t be coming out for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>There are startups working on the dexterity technology Brooks is skeptical humanoids will be able to reach, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/tesla-sues-former-optimus-engineer-over-alleged-trade-secret-theft/\">Y Combinator-backed Proception</a> and <a href=\"https://www.loomia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Loomia</a>, which built a kit that can help robotics companies start to incorporate touch into their machines.</p>\n<p>There are also numerous humanoid companies that are starting to take orders and gather interest in their robots. <a href=\"https://www.kscale.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">K-Scale Labs</a> received more than 100 preorders for its humanoid bot in the first five days, surprising even the founders, CEO Benjamin Bolte told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Hugging Face has also seen strong demand from developers for its two humanoid bots. The company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/hugging-face-opens-up-orders-for-its-reachy-mini-desktop-robots/\">opened up preorders</a> for its smaller desktop version, the Reachy Mini, in July. The reaction was palpable. Just five days after opening orders on its Reachy Mini robots, Hugging Face had logged $1 million worth of sales.</p>\n</div>"

For decades, expectant mothers have been racing against biology in the back seats of taxis and Ubers from London to Los Angeles. There was the mother in India who named her son Uber after giving birth to him en route to the hospital (the driver reportedly helped in the delivery). There was also the California couple in 2017 who welcomed their baby in an Uber during Shabbat.”Everyone is telling us to name the baby Uber,” the father joked, before adding, “But we can’t do that.” (Ah, though, they could have!)\nThe stories go on and on. Now, Silicon Valley has automated the experience, at least partially.\nThe vehicle in San Francisco was promptly removed for cleaning. Further, this wasn’t Waymo’s first birth — the company told the Standard that a Phoenix baby got there first. “While this is a very rare occurrence,” a Waymo spokesperson deadpanned, “some of our newest riders just can’t wait to experience their first Waymo ride.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

    "body": "\nSpotify announced on Wednesday that, for the first time, it’s giving users more control over the streaming service’s algorithm. That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.\nThe feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.\nThe new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.\nThe feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, which debuted last year, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. \nIn addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. \nFor instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.”\nImage Credits:Spotify\nIn another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes.\nThe company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.\nSpotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting users take control of its algorithm. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAmazon says it will allow authors to offer their DRM-free e-books in the EPUB and PDF formats through its self-publishing platform, Kindle Direct Publishing. Starting on January 20, 2026, authors who set their titles as DRM-free will see their books made available in these more open formats.\nThe decision to use Digital Rights Management (DRM), a copyright protection mechanism, is set by the authors when they publish their e-books on Amazon’s platform.\nThe company notes these changes won’t impact previously published titles. If authors want to change the status of older titles, they’ll have to log into the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) author portal and change an option in the settings. (Instructions on how to make that change are on Amazon’s KDP support site.)\nThis move may actually incentivize authors to apply DRM to their e-books.\nAs one author on the KDP Community forums, Leslie Anne Perry, noted, “Previously, I have not enabled DRM on my e-books. My thinking was that I wanted folks to be able to download them to other devices within their own household. However, I think I will enable it on any future e-books. I’m not sure I want people to be able to download them as a PDFs [sic].”\nAnother member pushed back at the complaints, arguing that it doesn’t really increase privacy, as those who had wanted to could always dump the existing DRM-free Kindle file into software to convert it into an EPUB or PDF.\nAmazon is positioning the new feature as making it “easier” for readers to enjoy the content they’ve already purchased, but the reality is that authors would have to opt in if they want to open up access to their older works. To remove the DRM, authors will have to click a box that says, “I understand that by not applying DRM, customers who buy and have already bought this book will be able to download it as a PDF or EPUB file.”\nElsewhere, Amazon has been making it more difficult for Kindle owners to share or back up their e-books through heavier use of DRM in recent months.\nWith an update to Kindle’s software for 11th- and 12th-generation devices, the retailer introduced a new DRM system that made it impossible for Kindle users to back up their e-books without jailbreaking their device. This had followed an earlier change to remove the download and transfer options via USB, which angered many Kindle owners.\nAfter the author updates their e-book’s DRM status, Amazon says the changes will take up to 72 hours before they are live on Amazon.com.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nReddit is starting a limited test of verified profiles, which places a grey checkmark beside the username of a notable person or business.\n“This feature is designed to help redditors understand who they’re engaging with in moments when verification matters, whether it’s an expert or celebrity hosting an AMA, a journalist reporting news, or a brand sharing information,” Reddit wrote in a blog post.\nBelieve it or not, there used to be a time on the internet where a verification checkmark simply just confirmed that a notable figure is who they say they are, and was not a signifier that you are paying a monthly fee to Elon Musk and/or Mark Zuckerberg. But Reddit has decided that perhaps it is, actually, a good idea to verify the accounts of public figures in an attempt to mitigate the spread of misinformation. \nReddit acknowledges that pseudonymity is a key part of its culture, allowing users to express themselves more openly than they would if their real name was attached to everything they say. But Reddit says that this feature is completely voluntary and opt-in. The verification feature is less so about denoting a special elite status, but making it easier for both ordinary users and subreddit moderators to quickly verify that someone is being truthful about their identity.\nThe absence of a checkmark doesn’t mean someone is a fraud, though. Reddit is piloting this feature with a small batch of profiles, and even if the checkmarks get a full rollout, it’s still possible that some famous Redditors won’t get a check.\nTony Hawk, for example, posts very casually on skateboarding subreddits, simply chatting about his favorite sport with likeminded fans. He’s just like us! But he does blow up his spot a bit when he shares his own skating videos on r/OldSkaters, because there probably aren’t many 57-year-olds doing heel flips.\n\nWhile Reddit’s checkmarks are in their alpha rollout, users will be eligible if they’re active contributors in good standing and “trusted partners,” which Reddit did not specify. Having a checkmark doesn’t give a user any special privileges. However, users will not be eligible for a checkmark if they are an NSFW profile, or if they primarily engage in NSFW communities. \nFor now, Reddit is manually verifying profiles, but says it will use a third-party process in the future.\nIt’s probably not a coincidence that Reddit is exploring verification at the same time that its co-founder Alexis Ohanian is launching a reboot of the social aggregator, Digg. Digg’s founders have expressed concern that the internet is becoming flooded with bots and AI agents, and they want Digg to be a place where people can connect with actual humans. They’ve said they’re looking into using zero-knowledge proofs as a potential way to verify that users are human.\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has also been exploring means of verifying people’s humanity online. World, Altman’s human verification project, is expected to release an app this week that also focuses on keeping out bots.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The e-commerce giant says it will expand the service to additional cities in 2026. \nAmazon launched the ability to order perishable items via Same-Day Delivery in August, a move that was seen as a way for the company to compete more directly with Instacart and Walmart+ in the quick-commerce space.\nSince launch, customers have ordered fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and frozen foods alongside electronics, books, pantry staples, and snacks, as well as everyday household essentials like paper towels and toothpaste.\nAmazon says its “specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” ensures that shoppers receive perishable groceries intact, and that orders undergo a six-point quality check upon arrival and before leaving for delivery. Plus, temperature-sensitive products are delivered in insulated bags.\nFresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered items for fast delivery, Amazon says.\nThe top bestsellers for Same-Day Delivery are bananas, Haas avocados, strawberries, honeycrisp apples, limes, blueberries, blackberries, organic bananas, navel oranges, and bathroom tissues.\nThe company also notes that perishable grocery sales have grown 30 times since January, and that customers who add fresh groceries to their Same-Day Delivery orders shop about twice as often as those who don’t.\nSame-day delivery is free for orders worth more than $25 for Prime members. If an order doesn’t meet the minimum amount, subscribers can still choose same-day delivery for a $2.99 fee. For customers without a Prime membership, the service is available with a $12.99 fee, regardless of the order size.\nAmazon says it has grown its perishable selection available for Same-Day Delivery by over 30% since August, and has included thousands of popular items from Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify may be synonymous with music streaming, but it’s also got a wildly popular developer-tool side-hustle called “Backstage.”  \nBackstage is an open source project that helps companies build their own internal developer portals: a catalog of their developer tools along with quick visualizations of the work the tools have done, and other metrics. But like many open-source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.  \nIsraeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that’s also now been geared to manage AI agents.  \nOn Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company’s $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, announced in May. \nOf all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is where it has the deepest roots. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code. \nBut the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it’s the wild west right now for such devtool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards and so on.\nDevelopers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. \nPort therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer that). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human-in-the-loop, as desired, to approval processes.  \nA feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. \nIn addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving helpdesk tickets and dealing with provisioning. \nEiny describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” \nWith its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.\nThe entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from big tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include LangChain, UiPath, Cortex and more. \n"

    "body": "\nFlaviu Radulescu started Runware in 2023 when he was testing a text-to-image company and realized that, though genAI tech was powerful, it was slow in generating images. So Radulescu teamed up with Ioana Hreninciuc and launched Runware as a dev tool platform that specializes in generating images, videos, and audio in real time.\nThe company has seen much growth since it first launched. It has powered more than 10 billion creations for more than 200,000 developers, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe product lets developers integrate Runware’s API into their apps and then generate media assets through one interface, so they don’t have to set up any new infrastructure or maintain separate integrations. It has a custom AI inference infrastructure for open-source models, and provides day-zero access (meaning as soon as a model is released, it can run on Runware) and competitive pricing, Hreninciuc, who focuses on operations and GTM, told TechCrunch.\nOn Thursday, the company announced a $50 million Series A in a round led by Dawn Capital. Dawn Capital Partner Shamillah Bankiya is joining the board. Others in the round include Insight Partners and a16z Speedrun. Runware has raised $66 million in funding to date.\nHreninciuc said the company remains competitive through its pricing, which is “more-cost effective,” in addition to having a fully unified API. She said the company does this with its Sonic Inference Engine, which runs on custom AI hardware. It also partners with third-party AI cloud providers so that it can reroute workloads automatically in case more memory is needed.\n“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” she continued.\nStartups that focus on dev tools for image and video have been a particularly hot market for VC interest lately. Fal.ai, for instance, just raised $140 million at a $4.5 billion valuation, its second giant raise in a matter of months. Fal.ai focuses on the breadth of model offerings versus customizing for speed. So, Hreninciuc considers her competitors to be Fal.ai and Replicate, a startup that runs open-source models in apps with just a few lines of code.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese companies, as Radulescu previously told TechCrunch, sell based on GPU compute time. Runware instead leans toward the model of Stable Diffusion and Flux, offering a more cost-per-image generated so that people can pay for what they need rather than buying a block of compute time.  \nHreninciuc said the fresh capital will be used to keep expanding the company’s infrastructure and it hopes to use its Sonic Inference Engine to power over 2 million models. The big goal is to be the API for all AI — so that any generative AI model can and does run on the platform.\n“We’re also expanding rapidly into new modalities,” she said, adding that the company is going to expand the current team of around 25 to help make that happen.\nOverall, Hreninciuc hopes Runware continues to “make it possible for applications to scale to millions of users while actually keeping their margins,” she said, adding that it helps make the market more affordable. That “benefits everyone,” she continued. “From the app builders to the end users, and puts powerful AI into more people’s hands globally.”\nThis piece was updated to correct the spelling of Radulescu‘s name and to update what the competitors are. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAfter a string of disturbing mental health incidents involving AI chatbots, a group of state attorneys general have sent a letter to the AI industry’s top companies, with a warning to fix “delusional outputs” or risk being in breach of state law. \nThe letter, signed by dozens of AGs from U.S. states and territories with the National Association of Attorneys General, asks the companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and 10 other major AI firms, to implement a variety of new internal safeguards to protect their users. Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter.\nThe letter comes as a fight over AI regulations has been brewing between state and federal government.\nThose safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to “evaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,” the letter states.\n“GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,” the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year — including suicides and murder — in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. “In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.”\nAGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents — with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures. \nCompanies should develop and publish “detection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,” the letter states. In a similar fashion to how data breaches are currently handled, companies should also “promptly, clearly, and directly notify users if they were exposed to potentially harmful sycophantic or delusional outputs,” the letter says. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother ask is that the companies develop “reasonable and appropriate safety tests” on GenAI models to “ensure the models do not produce potentially harmful sycophantic and delusional outputs.” These tests should be conducted before the models are ever offered to the public, it adds.  \nTechCrunch was unable to reach Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI for comment prior to publication. The article will be updated if the companies respond.\nTech companies developing AI have had a much warmer reception at the federal level. \nThe Trump administration has made it known it is unabashedly pro-AI, and, over the past year, multiple attempts have been made to pass a nationwide moratorium on state-level AI regulations. So far, those attempts have failed — thanks, in part, to pressure from state officials.\nNot to be deterred, Trump announced Monday he plans to pass an executive order next week that will limit the ability of states to regulate AI. The president said in a post on Truth Social he hoped his EO would stop AI from being “DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY.”\n"

    "body": "\nGoogle just made a major move in the AI infrastructure arms race, elevating Amin Vahdat to chief technologist for AI infrastructure, a newly created position reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai, according to a memo first reported by Semafor and later confirmed by TechCrunch. It’s a signal of just how critical this work has become as Google pours up to $93 billion into capital expenditures by the end of 2025 — a number that parent company Alphabet expects will be a whole lot bigger next year.\nVahdat isn’t new to the game. The computer scientist, who holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and started as a research intern at Xerox PARC back in the early ’90s, has been quietly building Google’s AI backbone for the past 15 years. Before joining Google in 2010 as an engineering fellow and VP, he was an associate professor at Duke University and later a professor and SAIC Chair at UC San Diego. His academic credentials are formidable — with what appears to be around 395 published papers — and his research has always focused on making computers work more efficiently at massive scale.\nVahdat already maintains a high profile with Google. Just eight months ago, at Google Cloud Next, he took the stage to unveil the company’s seventh-generation TPU, called Ironwood, in his role as VP and GM of ML, Systems, and Cloud AI. The specs he rattled off at the event were staggering, too: over 9,000 chips per pod delivering 42.5 exaflops of compute — more than 24 times the power of the world’s No. 1 supercomputer at the time, he said. “Demand for AI compute has increased by a factor of 100 million in just eight years,” he told the audience.\nBehind the scenes, as noted by Semafor, Vahdat has been orchestrating the unglamorous and essential work that keeps Google competitive, including those custom TPU chips for AI training and inference that give Google an edge over rivals like OpenAI, as well as the Jupiter network, the super-fast internal network that allows all its servers to talk to each other and move massive amounts of data around. (In a blog post late last year, Vahdat said that Jupiter now scales to 13 petabits per second, explaining that’s enough bandwidth to theoretically support a video call for all 8 billion people on Earth simultaneously.) \nVahdat has also been deeply involved in the ongoing development of the Borg software system, Google’s cluster management system that acts as the brain coordinating all the work happening across its data centers. And he has said he oversaw the development of Axion, Google’s first custom Arm-based general-purpose CPUs designed for data centers, which the company unveiled last year and continues to build.\nIn short, Vahdat is central to Google’s AI story.\nIndeed, in a market where top AI talent commands astronomical compensation and constant recruitment, Google’s decision to elevate Vahdat to the C-suite may also be about retention. When you’ve spent 15 years building someone into a linchpin of your AI strategy, you make sure they stay.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023.

    "body": "\nThe Calibri font is the latest government worker to be fired from the Trump administration for its association with diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. \nIn an action that reads like a story from The Onion (and will certainly be fodder for “Saturday Night Live” or “South Park”), U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has banned the font and ordered diplomats to use Times New Roman for official documents instead, the New York Times reported after obtaining a leaked memo on the topic. \nCalibri, which is a sans-serif font, was apparently adopted in 2023 during Biden’s tenure. It was chosen by the department’s then-DEI office, which has since been disbanded under Rubio amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directives. \nThe font was chosen in an effort to make documents easier to read for the vision impaired. Sans-serif fonts are those without decorative swirls and lines at the ends of letters. With their cleaner lines and slightly wider letter spacing, they are considered more accessible for people with issues ranging from dyslexia to low vision (although research on how much the serifs themselves impact readability has been inconclusive).  \nRubio’s memo has designated Times New Roman as his tenure’s official font, stating it will “restore decorum and professionalism” to documents. Rubio did admit in the memo that Calibri wasn’t the “most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful” example of DEI to his mind’s eye, but he still berated the font for contributing to “the degradation” of the State Department’s official correspondence.  \nMany people across the political spectrum dislike Calibri (according to an informal survey of TechCrunch writers) but all the same, that’s a harsh criticism for a font. \nApparently, there were rumblings within the department in 2023 when Calibri was first adopted, the New York Times reported.

    "body": "\nOboe, a learning startup from Anchor co-founders and former Spotify execs Nir Zicherman and Michael Mignano, said today it has raised $16 million in Series A funding led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Eniac, Haystack, Offline, and Factorial. The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D’Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.\nThat platform, which officially launched in September, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. \nThe startup’s fundraise comes three months after the app’s launch and a year after it raised a $4 million seed round. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.\n“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” \n“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.\nBryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn’t make users wait behind a loading indicator. \n“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe company is making changes to its core course-generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.\nImage Credits:Oboe\nWith the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics. What’s more, users will see other modalities like quizzes appear within the course material seamlessly. For some courses, Oboe will also generate flashcards for you to easily remember course materials.\nIn terms of audio, instead of having to choose between a podcast format and a lecture format, the company generates a podcast for you and changes its tone based on the learning material and other signals from users. \nImage Credits:Oboe\nZicherman said that the company observed that there is a high demand among users to learn about STEM topics (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). The startup has worked on sourcing the best material for these topics, including programming.\nHe said that good teachers decide what is the best way of learning for students and the company is taking that approach of designing courses for learners.\nImage Credits:Oboe\nOboe is revamping its pricing model to give unlimited course generation to users. \nHowever, if they want to dive deeper into a topic, they can pay $15 a month ($144 per year) to access more course chapters. There is also a $40 per month ($384 per year) Pro plan, which gives unlimited chapter access and allows users to export or download courses for consumption outside Oboe. The startup said this is suitable for students who want to take printouts of the study material and consume it offline.\nZicherman said that right now Oboe is offering courses in English, but it wants to reach different parts of the world better with localized courses and language support. The platform is currently available on the web, with mobile support planned for the future. \nIn the last few years, multiple tools, including Google’s NotebookLM and ex-Google employees’ Huxe, allow you to enter a prompt to get a podcast episode to explore a topic. While these are one-off generations, Oboe’s approach is to let you dive deeper into the topic with chapter-based learning.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle is testing AI-powered article overviews on participating publications’ Google News pages as part of a new pilot program, the search giant announced on Wednesday. \nNews publishers participating in the pilot program include Der Spiegel, El País, Folha, Infobae, Kompas, The Guardian, The Times of India, The Washington Examiner, and The Washington Post, among others.\nThe purpose of the new commercial partnership program is to “explore how AI can drive more engaged audiences,” Google said in a blog post. As part of the new AI pilot program, the company will work with publishers to experiment with new features in Google News.\nBy adding AI-powered article overviews, Google says users will get more context before they click through to read an article. While AI-generated summaries may lead to fewer clicks on news articles, publications participating in the commercial pilot program will receive direct payments from Google, which could make up for the potential decrease in traffic to their sites. \nThe AI-powered article overviews will only appear on participating publications’ Google News pages, and not anywhere else on Google News or in Search.\nThis isn’t the first time that Google has introduced AI summaries for news. In July, the company rolled out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google’s search app. With this change, users no longer see a single headline from a major publication in the feed. Instead, they see the logos of multiple news publishers in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.\nGoogle is also experimenting with audio briefings for people who prefer listening to the news rather than reading it, as part of the new pilot program. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company says these features will include clear attribution and a link to articles.\nAdditionally, Google is partnering with organizations such as Estadão, Antara, Yonhap, and The Associated Press to incorporate real-time information and enhance results in the Gemini app. \n“As the way people consume information evolves, we’ll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem,” Google wrote in its blog post. “We’re doing this work in collaboration with websites and creators of all sizes, from major news publishers to new and emerging voices.”\nImage Credits:Google\nAs part of Google’s Wednesday announcement, the company said that it’s launching its “Preferred Sources” feature globally after first launching it in the U.S. and India in August. The feature allows users to select their favorite news sites and blogs to appear in the Top Stories section of Google search results.\nIn the coming days, the feature will be available for English-language users worldwide, and Google plans to roll it out to all supported languages early next year.\nGoogle will now also highlight links from your news subscriptions and show these links in a dedicated carousel in the Gemini app in the coming weeks, with AI Overviews and AI Mode to follow.\nWhile these features make it easy for users to access news from their preferred sources, they also risk confining them to an ideological bubble that limits their exposure to different perspectives.\nGoogle also announced that it’s increasing the number of inline links in AI Mode. Additionally, it’s introducing “contextual introductions” for embedded links, which are brief explanations that explain why a link could be useful to explore.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Luminar\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:00 AM PDT · October 31, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nLidar-maker Luminar is warning shareholders that it will run out of cash in early 2026 and has announced a 25% cut to its workforce to help staunch the bleeding — its second layoff of the year — according to a Friday regulatory filing.\nIt’s not immediately clear how many workers will be affected. Luminar started the year with around 580 employees, but the company did not specify the size of the layoff earlier this year. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe company also announced its chief financial officer, Thomas Fennimore, is stepping down on November 13 “to pursue other career opportunities.” Luminar said Fennimore’s departure is “not the result of any disagreement” about its finances or with the company’s auditors.\nThis all comes as founder Austin Russell — who was replaced as CEO in May following an unspecified ethics inquiry by the board of directors’ audit committee — is in the middle of trying to buy the company. That buyout was encouraged by at least some of the board members, as TechCrunch previously reported.\nLuminar has struggled in part because it has sold fewer lidar sensors to Volvo, which was supposed to be a major customer. In August, Fennimore said Luminar was therefore selling the sensors at a lower cost than it takes to build them. \nLuminar said Friday that it has $72 million of cash and marketable securities as of October 24. Without any additional fundraising, the current burn rate means Luminar could run out of money as early as the first quarter of next year, or breach the terms of certain loan agreements. \nOn Friday, Luminar revealed it had already skipped required quarterly interest payments on certain loans that were due October 15. Those lenders have agreed to give Luminar until November 6 to make the payments before taking any action.\nLuminar is not due to report its third-quarter financial results for another two weeks, but on Friday, it revealed it expects to report around $18 million of revenue and debt of $429 million.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Zach Gibson / Stringer / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:34 AM PDT · October 31, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman said AI chatbots aren’t a major traffic driver for the social platform despite companies like OpenAI and Google having seen progress in people using AI for search. During Reddit’s Q3 2025 call, the exec noted that Google search and direct access continue to be its top traffic drivers. \n“[Chatbots are] not a traffic driver today. I think our relationships with the companies that we work for — or work with directly are healthy, and we both learned a lot over the last couple of years, really the value of Reddit’s data and where our respective products can go and how we can help each other. So I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners. But they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Huffman said during the call with analysts.\nAn analyst asked the company if 50% of the traffic comes from Google and 50% direct. Huffman said that those numbers are “approximate, but pretty close.”\nReddit has had a tricky relationship with LLM builders. The company locked down its data through a new policy change in May 2024 and indicated that any kind of commercial use of its data would need a license. At the same time, the company signed a deal with OpenAI to let it use Reddit data for model training.\nThe company also has a partnership agreement with Google. On the other hand, it has started a legal battle with AI companies like Anthropic and Perplexity.\nReddit reported a positive quarter with $585 million in revenue, up 68% year-on-year. The company also clocked in 116 million daily active unique users and 444 million weekly active unique users, with 20% growth year-over-year. The company mentioned it recorded 31% year-on-year growth in international daily users. It also said that more than 190 million Americans visit the social network every week.\nThe company mentioned that it continues to invest in making the search experience a central part of the experience. Huffman said that the company is handling 20% of search volumes through its AI-powered Answers and “that kind of core search box.” He noted that in Q3, 75 million people searched weekly on Reddit. The company has been talking about unifying AI and the core search experience, and Huffman said it is coming in the next few quarters.\nWhat’s more, Reddit is experimenting with a new and simpler onboarding flow to increase early user engagement.\n“We want them to see in their first session that Reddit is amazing and has content for them. So our goal is to connect users with relevant content very quickly,” Huffman said.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The latest exchange began when Altman posted what he called “a tale in three acts,” with screenshots showing that he reserved a Tesla Roadster in 2018, then recently tried to cancel it and request a refund on his $50,000 reservation fee, only for his email to bounce.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nThe second-generation Roadster sports car was first announced in November 2017 but has been repeatedly pushed back, with Musk (Tesla’s CEO) recently saying that a new version will be unveiled by the end of this year.\nMusk first responded to Altman’s post by writing, “You stole a nonprofit,” a criticism that he’s directed at Altman and OpenAI before — not just in tweets, but also with lawsuits and takeover bids seeking to stymie OpenAI’s attempts to restructure as a for-profit company (a process that OpenAI recently completed, with its non-profit arm still retaining control over the for-profit public benefit corporation).\nMusk even started a rival AI startup, xAI, which is suing OpenAI and Apple over allegations that the two companies are colluding to stifle competition. (Altman said the accusation is “remarkable … given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.”)\nIn addition to repeating his criticism of Altman and OpenAI, Musk also suggested today that Altman’s screenshots didn’t tell the full story: “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours. But that is in your nature.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "description": "As users \"dislike\" posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked in feeds, but also reply rankings.",
    "body": "\nSocial network Bluesky, which on Friday announced a new milestone of 40 million users, will soon start testing “dislikes” as a way to improve personalization on its main Discover feed and others.\nThe news was shared alongside a host of other conversation control updates and changes, which include smaller tweaks to replies, improved detection of toxic comments, and other ways to prioritize more relevant conversations to the individual user.\nWith the “dislikes” beta rolling out soon, Bluesky will take into account the new signal to improve user personalization. As users “dislike” posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked in feeds, but also reply rankings.\nThe company explained the changes are designed to make Bluesky a place for more “fun, genuine, and respectful exchanges” — an edict that follows a month of unrest on the platform as some users again criticized the platform over its moderation decisions. While Bluesky is designed as a decentralized network where users run their own moderation, some subset of Bluesky users want the platform itself to ban bad actors and controversial figures instead of leaving it up to the users to block them.\nBluesky, however, wants to focus more on the tools it provides users to control their own experience. \nToday, this includes things like moderation lists that let users quickly block a group of people they don’t want to interact with, content filter controls, muted words, and the ability to subscribe to other moderation service providers. Bluesky also lets users detach quote posts to limit unwanted attention, which has long influenced the toxic culture of “dunking” on X (formerly Twitter).\nIn addition to dislikes, the company says it’s testing a mix of ranking updates, design changes, and other feedback tools to improve the conversations on its network.\nThis includes a new system that will map out the “social neighborhoods” on Bluesky, meaning the connections between people who often interact and reply to one another. Bluesky says it’s prioritizing replies from people “closer to your neighborhood,” to make conversations you’re shown in your feed more relevant and familiar. The new “dislikes” may have some influence here, as well, Bluesky says. \nThis, in particular, is an area where competitor Threads, from Meta, has been challenged at times. \nAs newsletter writer Max Read noted last year, Threads tended to land its users in a confusing feed where conversations they weren’t connected to would appear, sometimes in mid-story. Read remarked that “it’s often impossible to figure out who is replying to whom and where and why you’re seeing certain posts. They appear from nowhere and lead to nowhere,” he wrote at the time.\nBluesky’s plan to map out social neighborhoods could address this issue as it scales.\nThe company also said its latest model does a better job at detecting replies that are “toxic, spammy, off-topic, or posted in bad faith,” and downranks these in threads, search results, and notifications. \nAnother change to the Reply button will now take users to the full thread instead of straight into the compose screen, which may encourage users to read the thread before responding. \nThis, says Bluesky, is a simple way to “reduce content collapse and redundant replies” — another criticism that tends to be levied at Twitter/X.\nPlus, the company is tweaking the reply settings feature to make it more visible to users that they can control who is allowed to respond to their posts.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOn Thursday, at the end of Coinbase’s third quarter earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that he was “a little bit distracted,” because he’d been “tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call.”\n“And I just want to add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Staking, and Web3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call,” Armstrong added.\nWhy blurt those out without any apparent context? As Armstrong hinted, they were words that users on “mention markets” on Kalshi and Polymarket had wagered would be spoken on the call. So by speaking the words, Armstrong was allowing some of those bets to pay off.\nBloomberg reports that while mention markets remain a relatively niche part of prediction markets, a total of $84,000 had been bet on whether certain words would be spoken on the cryptocurrency company’s call. And while Armstrong may have helped some Kalshi and Polymarket users make a little money, he was also illustrating how easily these markets can be manipulated when executives become aware of them.\nIn fact, Jeff Dorman, CIO at digital assets investment firm Arca, wrote on X that “you need your head examined if you think it’s cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market.”\n“It’s not fun working tirelessly for 8 years trying to educate institutional investors on the value of crypto investing as an investable asset class, and working to help them gain comfort in this industry, while one of the supposed ‘leaders’ openly mocks the industry with crap like this,” Dorman said.\nPolymarket, meanwhile, posted that Armstrong’s comments were “diabolical work.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCoinbase is moving into supporting prediction markets itself through its Everything Exchange, which Armstrong touted on the earnings call, and the company has also invested in Kalshi and Polymarket. A Coinbase spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company prohibits employees from participating in prediction markets or related activity around the company.\nAfter Armstrong’s remarks began drawing attention, he wrote on X, “lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nMeta signed three deals this week to procure nearly 1 gigawatt of solar power as it races to power its lofty AI ambitions.\nThe trio of agreements brings Meta’s total solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts of capacity this year. Solar is cheap and quick to build, and as a result, it has become a go-to power source for tech companies as their data center fleets multiply in size.\nMeta yesterday announced two agreements in Louisiana that see it buying the environmental attributes of a combined 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are expected to be completed two years from now.\nThey follow on the heels of a larger deal announced Monday in which Meta bought 600 megawatts from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas. The project will also start commercial operations in 2027.\nWhile the Texas power plant won’t connect directly to Meta data centers, it will feed into the local grid, offsetting use by the facilities.\nThe Louisiana deals, though, involve purchasing of certificates that allow Meta to offset its carbon-intensive sources of power. \nSuch environmental attribute certificates (EACs), sometimes called renewable energy certificates, have been criticized by experts for obscuring the true carbon footprint of tech companies’ operations, which have ballooned as AI has driven up electricity use.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEACs were introduced years ago when renewables were costly relative to fossil fuel generators. They let anyone buy the electricity, but also gave companies an option to pay extra to offset their own emissions — and offset the higher costs of renewable power. They helped encourage developers to build more renewable projects.\nBut the cost of new solar and wind has dropped dramatically since then, with renewables undercutting new fossil power and sometimes existing coal and natural gas power plants. EACs don’t provide the same incentive as before, and experts question how much additional renewable power they stimulate. \nIf companies truly want to offset their new energy use from AI, they should be encouraging developers to build new renewable capacity, experts argue.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nU.S. telecommunications giant Ribbon has confirmed that government-backed hackers had access to its network for almost a year before getting caught, according to a public filing.\nThe telco giant said in a 10-Q disclosure last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that a suspected “nation-state actor had gained access to the company’s IT network” as early as December 2024. Ribbon said it notified law enforcement and that it believes the hackers are no longer in its network.\nThe Texas-headquartered Ribbon provides phone, networking, and internet services for companies, enterprises, and critical infrastructure organizations, such as energy and transportation systems. The company counts hundreds of companies as customers, including Fortune 500 firms and government agencies, such as the Department of Defense.\nReuters first reported news of the breach. \nCatherine Berthier, a spokesperson for Ribbon, confirmed that three of Ribbon’s customers are known to be affected but declined to name the affected companies, citing confidentiality.\nIt’s not clear if the hackers exfiltrated personally identifiable information belonging to any individuals or other sensitive data from its corporate customers in the breach, but the company noted in the filing that “several customer files saved outside of the main network on two laptops do appear to have been accessed by the threat actor.” Ribbon said it notified the affected customers.\nRibbon is the latest in a series of telecommunication providers to have been hacked over the past two years but did not immediately attribute the hack to a particular government, when asked by TechCrunch.\nBerthier declined to provide additional information when asked by TechCrunch, citing the company’s ongoing investigation.\nChinese-backed hackers have previously targeted and compromised at least 200 U.S.-based companies, including phone and internet providers, in an effort to steal phone records and calling data about senior U.S. government officials. Several telcos, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, were confirmed hacked as part of the campaign, along with cloud giants and datacenter providers. \nSome of the companies were located outside of the United States, including in Canada.\nThe hackers, known as Salt Typhoon, are one of several China-backed hacking groups said to be targeting the U.S. and its allies as part of a multi-year effort to prepare for a future anticipated Chinese invasion of Taiwan, according to U.S. government officials.\nUpdated with comment from Ribbon.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is on track to record its strongest year of growth in three years, fueled by the AI industry’s unprecedented demand for computing power.\nAWS is growing 20% year-over-year and ended the third quarter with $33.1 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, Amazon announced in its third-quarter earnings release on Thursday. The business segment’s operating income increased to $11.4 billion in Q3, up from $10.4 billion at the same point in 2024.\n“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY,” Andy Jassy, the president and CEO of Amazon, said in the company’s earnings announcement. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\nAWS launched an infrastructure region in New Zealand during the quarter and has three more regions in the pipeline.\nThe cloud infrastructure provider also secured several new deals in Q3 across a variety of industries, including a few notable names in the AI market. In July, AWS partnered with Perplexity to launch the AI browser company’s enterprise product. AWS also partnered with Cursor during the third quarter.\nThe intense infrastructure demands of AI have also been a boon to AWS’s competitors. OpenAI and Oracle allegedly inked a massive $300 billion cloud compute deal in September that will start in 2027. The pair also made a deal for OpenAI to pay Oracle $30 billion a year for data center services. Last week, Google and Anthropic announced a cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars.\nThese huge deals come despite skepticism of how much cloud infrastructure will actually be needed in the future and if the industry is heading into bubble territory. However, it does makes sense for cloud companies like AWS to take advantage of a market where customers are willing to pay big sums for their services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“You’re going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing capacity because we see the demand,” Jassy said about investing in AI infrastructure. “As fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\nThis news comes two days after Amazon announced it was slashing 14,000 corporate jobs, as it looks to invest more in its AI strategy.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nApple CEO Tim Cook signaled to investors the company is still open to acquisitions and partnerships to move things forward on the AI front. \nThe comments were made this week during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. The exec also offered a brief update about Apple’s next-generation, AI-powered Siri, saying the service was still on track to launch in 2026.\n“We’re making good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it next year,” Cook said during his opening remarks. \nOne analyst on the call also asked Cook if Apple was still pursuing a three-pronged approach when it came to the development of its personalized AI — meaning a combination of in-house Apple foundation models, partnerships with third-party LLM providers, and acquisitions. \nCook responded that Apple was still open to the latter, noting the company continually surveils the market on M&A and  is “open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will advance our roadmap.”\nIn a pre-earnings interview with CNBC, Cook noted that Apple was preparing to announce more AI partnerships like the one it has with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,” Cook told the outlet.\nOn the earnings call, Cook also talked about how Apple creates foundation models, ships them on devices, and uses them in Private Cloud Compute, its cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing.\nCook shared later in the call that Apple is already using its Private Cloud Compute technology for a number of Siri queries and is continuing to build out that infrastructure.\n“In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we’ve got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. And, you know, it’s robust,” he said. \nCook additionally suggested that AI was a factor in consumers’ decision-making process when it comes to selecting a new smartphone. \n“I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor,” he said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAI search startup Perplexity has signed a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images, which gives it  permission to display images from Getty across its AI-powered search and discovery tools. The deal marks a notable shift for the company, which has been hit by allegations of content scraping and plagiarism, and signals an effort to establish more formal content partnerships. \nPerplexity and Getty have been working together for more than a year, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. Though it was never announced, Getty was part of Perplexity’s Publishers’ Program, a plan to share ad revenue with publishers when their content surfaced in a search query, the source said.  \nToday’s agreement is a new deal. A source told TechCrunch it’s not a traditional lump sum licensing deal, since Perplexity doesn’t train its own foundational models, but would not elaborate on the terms. \nPerplexity’s agreement with Getty appears to legitimize some of the startup’s previous use of Getty’s stock photos. Perplexity has come under fire within the last year for a series of plagiarism accusations from several news organizations. In one case, the startup was called out for pulling content from a Wall Street Journal article, including the Getty photo in that piece.  \nAt the time, several outlets questioned whether Perplexity’s use of the images constituted copyright infringement. A source last year told TechCrunch that Perplexity was working on an agreement with Getty, but we were unable to confirm the deal after reaching out to the stock image giant several times.  \nMore recently, Reddit sued Perplexity in October, alleging “industrial-scale, unlawful” scraping of user content and circumventing technical measures to access data. Reddit has a data licensing agreement with OpenAI. \nPerplexity says its Getty deal will help it better display images and include credits with links back to the original source whenever images show up in search results. \nNick Unsworth, vice president of strategic development at Getty, said the agreement “acknowledges the importance of properly attributed consent and its value in enhancing AI-powered products.” \n“Attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand the world in an age of AI,” Jessica Chan, head of content and publisher partnerships at Perplexity, said in a statement. “Together, we’re helping people discover answers through powerful visual storytelling while ensuring they always know where that content comes from and who created it.” \nPerplexity’s emphasis on attribution is part of its strategy of defending against copyright accusations by arguing its use of publisher content — including content behind a paywall or that publishers have explicitly indicated they don’t want scraped — constitutes “fair use” because publicly available facts are not copyrightable.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nAs tech companies tout their plans for massive new data centers, consumers are increasingly worried the AI-driven gold rush will ultimately drive up the price they pay for electricity, according to a new survey.\nThe report, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that 80% of consumers are worried about the impact of data centers on their utility bills.\nConsumers’ concerns aren’t unfounded.\nElectricity demand in the United States held steady for over a decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Over the last five years, commercial users including data centers and industrial users began drinking more deeply from the grid, with annual growth rising 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, residential use only grew by 0.7% annually.\nData centers today consume about 4% of the electricity generated in the United States, more than double their share in 2018. By 2028, consumption is forecasted to rise to 6.7% to 12%, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\nGeneration has managed to meet demand thanks to a surge in new capacity from solar, wind, and grid-scale battery storage. Big tech companies have been inking large deals for new utility-scale solar, in particular, attracted by the energy source’s low cost, modularity, and speed to power. Solar farms can start delivering power to data centers before they’re completed, and a new project typically takes around 18 months to complete. \nThe EIA expects renewables to dominate new generating capacity through at least the next year. The trend likely would have extended beyond 2026, but experts predict a Republican repeal of key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will hamper the renewables’ growth.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, natural gas, another source of energy favored by data center operators, hasn’t met the moment. Production has been rising, but most of the new supplies have gone toward feeding exports rather than the domestic market. Consumption by electricity generators rose by 20% between 2019 and 2024, while exporters consumed 140% more.\nNew natural gas power plants won’t be ready in time, either, since they take around four years to complete, according to the International Energy Agency. A backlog of turbines used by gas-fired power plants has only compounded the problem. Manufacturers are quoting delivery dates up to seven years out, and newly announced production capacity is unlikely to change things.\nSlow natural gas buildouts coupled with kneecapped renewables have put data center developers in a bind.\nWhile AI and data centers aren’t entirely responsible for increasing electricity demand — industrial users have been nearly as thirsty — they’ve been leading the headlines. \nAI is likely to be the focus of consumers’ ire: More people are concerned about the technology than excited about it, according to a Pew survey. No surprise given that many employers have been wielding the tool as a way to cut headcount rather than improve augment employee productivity.\nThrow rising energy prices into the mix, and you can begin to see how a backlash might be brewing.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday morning at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, our senior producer Maggie Nye rolled up her jacket sleeve to show me her new tattoo: a classic, pixelated cursor arrow. TechCrunch’s Becca Szkutak got a matching cursor, while Theresa Loconsolo got a smiling moon.\nI guessed that at some point during all the Disrupt hoopla, Maggie and Becca wandered off to some trendy San Francisco tattoo shop to cement their friendship with appropriately tech-themed ink (and maybe Theresa was there too?). That seemed like a more logical explanation than the reality, which is that they got these tattoos at Disrupt — yes, literally at Disrupt, on the Moscone Center’s convention floor, while upstairs, there was probably a talk going on about product-market fit or agentic AI.\nHundreds of startups showed their stuff in the Expo Hall as part of the Battlefield 200 — there’s robo chefs, spacecraft insurance providers, a shortcut for recycling plastic — and then amid the chaos, Tattd turned their booth into a mini tattoo shop.\nMaggie’s tattoo.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nTattd is a platform that helps tattoo seekers find artists whose portfolios match the kind of tattoo they’re looking for. \nThe startup uses generative AI to create a mockup of a design, but these synthetic designs aren’t actually getting inked on anyone’s body. Rather, Tattd puts the AI-generated design through a reverse image search to find an artist whose work resembles the mock-up, so that the client and artist can work together to create an original design, as one normally would when they get connected with a tattoo artist.\n“If you go to ChatGPT and say something like, ‘I want to see a butterfly in a Japanese traditional style with heavier lines,’ they don’t know what that means,” founder Laura Schaack told TechCrunch.\nJust feet away, TechCrunch deputy managing editor Karyne Levy was getting an escape key tattooed on her upper arm.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKaryne’s tattoo.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nBefore founding Tattd, Schaack led operations for two startups: WearAway, a fashion rental company acquired by Grin, and Lemonsqueeze, a market expansion platform acquired by Knotel. But Schaack has always had an eye for the arts. She studied art history at New York University, and her body is decorated with a collage of tattoos — at Disrupt, she got a California postage stamp by her elbow.\n“There is a number of people that have tried to enter the tattoo industry without tattoos, and they have all failed,” Schaack said. While you can’t judge a founder by their appearance, she says that their lack of tattoos reflected their lack of interest, investment, or experience in the industry.\n“I’m so deeply passionate about this industry, I’m heavily tattooed, and I’m here to support artists to build businesses in a way that both the client and the artist are taken care of,” she said. There are 900 artists on Tattd, and the platform partners with a third party to help them find healthcare and financial advisers.\nTattd’s flash sheet.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nSchaack said that around 30 people got tattoos throughout the three days of TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThere was a TechCrunch logo on the flash sheet, but (un)fortunately, no one inked their love for our brand on their body.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nCore Scientific shareholders on Thursday voted down an all-stock acquisition offer from partner and competitor CoreWeave that was valued at the time at $9 billion.  \nThey did so following a vote-no recommendation from their largest shareholder, Sina Toussi of Two Seas Capital, a firm that focuses on post-bankruptcy companies. Core Scientific emerged from its bankruptcy in January 2024.  \nCore Scientific, which began as a crypto miner and still is one, shares that early history with AI data center provider CoreWeave, which also started as a miner.  \nBut CoreWeave, with investor and partner Nvidia, has now transitioned to serving AI workloads. From its IPO until now, its stock has soared from a $14 billion market cap to $66 billion today (about $140 per share) as investors view it as a way to get in on the AI action. It has been spending those shares on acquisitions.  \nCoreWeave had already signed a $10 billion, 12-year contract with Core Scientific to use its facilities for AI services, even as it nailed down a deal announced in July to buy the company outright. The offer was a premium to Core Scientific’s share price at the time.\nBut investor Toussi thinks Core Scientific can turn into another CoreWeave on its own.  “Since the transaction was announced in July, investment in AI infrastructure has accelerated, driving equity valuations of Core Scientific’s peers to ever-greater heights,” he wrote in his opposition letter. “Why would anyone vote for a transaction worth a mere $16.40 per share?” \nSo investors turned down the deal and CoreWeave walked. Core Scientific’s stock rose on the news, and the company is now trading at a $6.6 billion market cap. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestors turning down acquisition bids in pursuit of bigger offers is another sign that we’re in — or at least headed for — an AI bubble. \nMeanwhile, CoreWeave is still shopping. On Thursday, it turned around and acquired Marimo, an open source Jupyter Notebook competitor, for an undisclosed sum. PitchBook estimates Marimo has raised about $5 million.\nPython notebooks are dev tools that combine code, rich media, and explanatory text into a single, shareable file. They’re often used for interactive data analysis as well as AI app development, helping CoreWeave as it attempts to move up the stack from hosting to AI app building.\n"

    "body": "\nOn Friday morning, University of Pennsylvania alumni, students, staff, and community affiliates received several emails from hackers purporting to represent the university’s Graduate School of Education (GSE).\n“We have terrible security practices and are completely unmeritocratic,” read the email. “We love breaking federal rules like FERPA (all your data will be leaked).” \nA partially redacted email sent by hackers with access to the university of Pennsylvania email system.Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nThis message was sent from a variety of different Penn-affiliated email accounts, such as the GSE, as well as purporting to come from several senior members of staff across the university.\nOther Penn affiliates have received the email multiple times from different senders with official @upenn.edu email addresses. (Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, I have received the message three times thus far to my personal email.)\nPenn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch in an email on Friday that the school’s incident response team is “actively addressing” the situation.\n“A fraudulent email has been circulated that appears to come from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. This is obviously a fake, and nothing in the highly offensive, hurtful message reflects the mission or actions of Penn or of Penn GSE,” Ozio said.\nAs the hackers plainly stated in their message (“Please stop giving us money”), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. The breach also comes soon after the university publicly rebuffed the White House’s offer to make commitments aligned with the Trump administration’s political agenda in exchange for federal funding. Penn and six other schools have rejected the White House’s proposal.\nThe White House’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” asks universities to abolish affirmative action in hiring and admissions, and to discipline departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” \nCompact signatories would also be required to freeze tuition for five years, offer tuition-free education to students pursuing “hard sciences,” cap international undergrad enrollment at 15%, and require standardized tests like the SAT for admission. \nThe compact also mandates that schools enforce policies that marginalize transgender and gender non-conforming students.\n“[The compact] preferences and mandates protections for the communication of conservative thought alone,” wrote Penn president J. Larry Jameson in his response to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, which was published on the university’s website.\n“One-sided conditions conflict with the viewpoint diversity and freedom of expression that are central to how universities contribute to democracy and to society,” wrote Jameson.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is visiting South Korea for the first time in 15 years to unveil new plans and deepen collaboration with major Korean tech companies — including Hyundai Motor, Samsung, SK, and Naver. During this week’s APEC Summit 2025, Nvidia and the South Korean government announced an expanded partnership to boost the country’s AI infrastructure and physical AI capabilities.\nThe announcement comes just days after the U.S. signed technology deals with Japan and South Korea, aiming to deepen strategic ties and boost collaboration on emerging technologies, including AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotech, and 6G.\nSouth Korea will secure over 260,000 of Nvidia’s latest GPUs to meet growing AI demands, the South Korean government announced on Friday. Around 50,000 GPUs will support public initiatives, including the development of domestic AI foundation models and a national AI data center. The remaining over 200,000 GPUs will go to companies such as Samsung, SK, Hyundai Motor Group, and Naver, driving AI-based manufacturing innovation and industry-specific AI model development.\nNvidia, Samsung team up on AI factory and AI-RAN for 6G \nSamsung also announced plans to build an AI mega-factory in partnership with Nvidia, bringing AI into every stage of its manufacturing for semiconductors, mobile devices, and robotics. Using more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs and the Omniverse platform, the facility will form an intelligent network capable of analyzing, predicting, and optimizing production in real time.\nSamsung and Nvidia, partners for over 25 years, are now collaborating on HBM4, a next-generation memory designed to power future AI applications.\nNvidia will work with Samsung, three Korean telecom operators — SK Telecom, KT, and LG Uplus — and ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute) to co-develop AI-RAN, according to the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT.\nAI-RAN combines mobile base stations with AI to boost performance and cut battery use, and under a new agreement, Nvidia and South Korea’s industry and research institutions will jointly develop next-generation AI-RAN and a global testbed, the Korean government stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn mid-October, Nvidia said Samsung Foundry will help make custom CPUs and XPUs, following its work with Intel to connect x86 CPUs directly to Nvidia platforms via NVLink Fusion.\nHyundai drives future mobility with AI factory\nMeanwhile, Hyundai and Nvidia are joining forces to build AI infrastructure and advance technologies in physical AI. The partnership plans to focus on autonomous mobility, smart factories, and robotics, while collaborating on high-performance GPU supply and investment\nAccording to Nvidia, the companies will use 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for integrated AI model training, validation, and deployment, and will establish AI research centers in South Korea to strengthen the country’s physical AI industry.\n“AI is revolutionizing every facet of every industry, and in transportation alone — from vehicle design and manufacturing to robotics and autonomous driving — Nvidia’s AI and computing platforms are transforming how the world moves,” said Huang. “Together with Hyundai Motor Group — Korea’s industrial powerhouse and one of the world’s top mobility solutions providers — we’re building intelligent cars and factories that will shape the future of the multitrillion-dollar mobility industry.”\nSK builds AI cloud; Naver partners on physical AI\nSK Group, parent of SK Hynix, is partnering with Nvidia to build Asia’s first enterprise-led manufacturing AI cloud, leveraging Nvidia’s simulation and digital twin platforms and opening access to the government, public institutions, and domestic startups.\nNaver Cloud, the cloud arm of Korean search engine Naver, is collaborating with Nvidia to develop a next-generation “Physical AI” platform that connects the physical and digital worlds. The cloud company intends to deploy AI infrastructure across key industries, including semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, and biotechnology, aiming to accelerate the adoption of AI solutions optimized for real-world industrial environments, according to Naver.\n“Just as the automotive industry is transitioning to SDVs, the era of ‘Physical AI,’ where AI operates directly within real industrial sites and systems, is unfolding,” Hae-jin Lee, founder of Naver, said in Naver’s statement.\nNvidia’s collaborations with Korean Big Tech giants — from Samsung’s AI network initiatives to Hyundai’s software-defined vehicles, SK Group’s industrial AI applications, and Naver’s cloud and AI services — highlight a broader trend, which is the fusion of AI and hardware across industries. These partnerships show how global tech leaders are joining forces to shape the next generation of intelligent systems.\nEarlier this week, the U.S. tech giant announced a wave of new partnerships with companies, including Eli Lilly, Palantir, Hyundai, Samsung, Uber, and Joby Aviation, along with the U.S. Department of Energy, as CEO Jensen Huang sought to downplay concerns about an AI bubble. The news sent its stock soaring, as Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market capitalization.\n"

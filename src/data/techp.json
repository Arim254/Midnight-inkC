Major platforms — including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva — announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.\n“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.\nOpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added. \nThis is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

The company’s AI division saw significant restructurings this year, which included leadership changes and the poaching of researchers from other top companies. However, several of the researchers who joined Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) have already left the company.\nLast month, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, also announced that he’s leaving to create his own startup.\nMeta doesn’t have a winning AI product as of yet. Instead, Meta AI assistant’s numbers are buoyed by the company’s existing social networks spanning billions of users, since the company places the assistant in the search bar of its apps.\nThis means the first projects and models coming out of MSL will have a lot riding on them. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”\nThat new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. \nThe closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.\nMuch of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.\nThe U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nApple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, Cisco revealed that a group of Chinese government-backed hackers is exploiting a vulnerability to target its enterprise customers who use some of the company’s most popular products.\nCisco has not said how many of its customers have already been hacked, or may be running vulnerable systems. Now, security researchers say there are hundreds of Cisco customers who could potentially be hacked.\nPiotr Kijewski, the chief executive of the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation that scans and monitors the internet for hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that the scale of exposure “seems more in the hundreds rather than thousands or tens of thousands.”\nKijewski said the foundation was not seeing widespread activity, presumably because “current attacks are targeted.” \nShadowserver has a page where it’s tracking the number of systems that are exposed and vulnerable to the flaw disclosed by Cisco, named officially as CVE-2025-20393. The vulnerability is known as a zero-day, because the flaw was discovered before the company had time to make patches available. As of press time, India, Thailand, and the United States collectively have dozens of affected systems within their borders.\nCensys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities across the internet, is also seeing a limited number of affected Cisco customers. According to a blog post, Censys has observed 220 internet-exposed Cisco email gateways, one of the products known to be vulnerable.  \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign? Such as what companies were targeted? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nIn its security advisory published earlier this week, Cisco said that the vulnerability is present in software found in several products, including its Secure Email Gateway and its Secure Email and Web Manager. \nCisco said these systems are only vulnerable if they are reachable from the internet, and have its “spam quarantine” feature enabled. Neither of those two conditions are enabled by default, per Cisco, which would explain why there appears to be, relatively speaking, not that many vulnerable systems on the internet. \nCisco did not respond to a request for comment, asking if the company could corroborate the numbers seen by Shadowserver and Censys. \nThe bigger problem with this hacking campaign is that there are no patches available. Cisco recommends that customers wipe and “restore an affected appliance to a secure state,” as a way to remediate any breach. \n“​​In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company wrote in its advisory. \nAccording to Cisco’s threat intelligence arm Talos, the hacking campaign has been ongoing since “at least late November 2025.”\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nKrafton, the South Korean gaming company behind hit titles such as PUBG and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), is launching a growth investment fund focused on India, stepping up its push into the world’s largest internet user base.\nCalled the Unicorn Growth Fund, the investment vehicle is a collaboration between Krafton and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver and investor Mirae Asset. It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.\nThe fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.\nNaver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.\nKrafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.\nTo date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content, and fintech spaces. Recent investments include fintech Cashfree and venture fund IMM Investment, alongside earlier bets on gaming and content platforms such as Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, and Kuku FM. The company also launched a gaming incubator in India in 2023 and acquired a controlling stake in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.\nKrafton’s expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi banned BGMI, the company’s flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 following a three-month trial approval. Krafton subsequently announced a $150 million investment commitment in the country.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBGMI, which has surpassed 240 million downloads, launched in 2021 as a revamped, localized version of PUBG Mobile, another popular title that was banned by the Indian government in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Since then, Krafton has made a series of operational changes in the country — including cutting ties with Tencent as its publisher and migrating its India servers to Microsoft’s Azure cloud — to address regulatory concerns.\nWith the new fund, Krafton is looking to extend its India strategy beyond gaming, channeling capital into a wider set of technology startups as it seeks to build a long-term presence in one of Asia’s fastest-growing digital markets.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.\nThe agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.\nAdditionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.\nInstacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.\n“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\nInstacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction.\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures. This figure represents the total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app’s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived, then only on iOS.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nWhat’s notable is that the bulk of that spending took place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in 2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the app’s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024 figure. \nImage Credits:Appfigures\nThese numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption, compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch. \nChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively. \nImage Credits:Appfigures\nxAI’s Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals. \nGrok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to matching ChatGPT’s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this on the chart below, which plots the AI apps’ spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.)\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nWhile the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by consumers, it’s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue. \nChatGPT’s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways, including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT, ads. In addition, ChatGPT on Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some way in the future, its blog post noted.\nGoogle, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode, AI Overviews, AI shopping, and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page, among other things. \nAnthropic is aiming at the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAs online platforms grapple with how to establish trust at a global scale and address growing concerns about authenticity, the adoption of profile verification on LinkedIn is picking up pace in 2025. India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.\nLinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, according to Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that more than 100 million users have added at least one verification.\nIn 2022, LinkedIn began rolling out profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before expanding to government-issued ID checks, and has since been extended to company pages and job listings.\nMost LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.\nAbout 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.\nThe pace of India growth\nGeographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets, including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.\nWhile the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndia is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with more than 160 million users, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.\nAs verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform. \nEarlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.\nLinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.\n“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "description": "Renowned AI scientist Yann LeCun confirmed on Thursday the worst-kept secret in the tech world: that he had indeed launched a new startup. Although he did say he will not be running the new company as its CEO.",
    "body": "\nRenowned AI scientist Yann LeCun confirmed on Thursday that he had launched a new startup — the worst-kept secret in the tech world — though he said he will not be running the new company as its CEO.\nHis startup is called Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) and has hired Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of medical transcription AI startup darling Nabla, as its CEO. Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a press release and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn.\n“Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun wrote.\nAMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask.\nFor instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, was valued at $12 billion for its seed round last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun.\nLeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, for his work on reinforcement learning.\nThe press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTop labs and startups like Google DeepMind and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, World Labs, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago.\nMeanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed.\nNabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, including a $70 million Series C in June. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation.\nNabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn.\nLeBrun said that Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community, is still growing well.\n“We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\n"

    "body": "\nCeleste Amadon and Asher Allen were working on an app that used AI to book restaurants for dates when they stumbled on a bigger idea that encourages people to meet in person. And now it’s catching on with investors.\nThe duo created a voice-powered AI onboarding system for their app that helped them learn more about users without them having to fill out a form. What they discovered: People loved to talk, and that increased the length of the onboarding session with the app clocking 26 minutes on average. That is how San Francisco-based dating startup Known was born. \n“Our take is that for the first time, we could know enough about somebody to serve them a date that would make sense. And if we could do that much faster with less rejection rate, we could create a user experience that could get people out on more dates,” she said.\nImage Credits:Known\nAnd early results suggested they were on to something. \nIn its test phase in San Francisco, Known said it observed 80% of its introductions led to in-person dates, which is much higher than swipe-based dating apps. Buoyed by these signals, the startup has raised $9.7 million from investors, including Forerunner and NFX, along with Pear VC and Coelius Capital. Notably, this is the first dating app investment for Forerunner.\n“Celeste is a really thoughtful founder who understands the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female, to be honest. There are other people who can be focused on the male demographic, but she is focused on the young female who has a lot of unspoken desires and needs that, if you put them in a profile, they would never say, this versus that. And I think in a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker,” Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner, told TechCrunch.\nAmadon said she has always been very interested in social impact at scale and thinks dating is inherently one of the biggest problems facing her generation. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There’ve been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it’s our generation’s largest problem,” said Amadon, who, along with Allen, dropped out of Stanford to build the startup. \nImage Credits:Known\nThe app, which is being testedin San Francisco in beta, uses voice AI-powered onboarding to ask several questions to users without having them fill out any forms. Amadon said because of this modality, the startup is able to know more about users and provide them with great matches, with one user’s onboarding clocking in at an hour and 38 minutes. \nAccording to Known, when people typed their responses out, they would edit them. With voice, the onboarding is more personable. The company’s AI can ask dynamic follow-ups based on the conversation. For instance, if someone has newly moved to the city, the AI can ask them what they like and dislike about their experience thus far.\nOnce the onboarding is complete, the AI suggests potential matches to users. They can ask AI agents about those profiles. If they like a profile, they can tap on “interested.” When two people are matched, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and 24 hours to agree to a date. The company said that with this mechanism, the app aims to avoid lingering chats and ghosting while encouraging people to meet in real life. After their dates, users can provide their feedback to the AI and get more refined recommendations for matches.\nKnown hasn’t completely ditched the restaurant idea. The app also helps in picking restaurants based on user likes and dislikes. Using the AI chat and calendar integrations, users can also indicate their availability for the first dates. In the beta phase, the company charged $30 per successful date. However, the startup is not set on the price and said it will experiment with different models to find out what payment modality works the best.\nImage Credits:Known\nToday the startup has three full-time engineers and four people working on go-to-market, with several contractors working in all areas. Amadon, whose previous experience includes internships in politics, and Allen, who worked on product at the AI-powered online shopping app Phia, plan to bolster headcount with this funding. \nKnown is currently testing in San Francisco and plans to launch early next year.\nThere are several other new startups, including Overtone, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod’s new app, that are trying to use AI to know more about users and try to find matches for them. Some of them claim to bring bespoke services of matchmakers that cost thousands of dollars at a fraction of the cost. Incumbents like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are also pushing AI features to keep their user base engaged. Despite the growing number of startups, Amadon welcomes the competition.\n“When it comes to other startup dating products, I’ve been so happy to see a lot of people building in the space because I think it shows that it’s time to shift away from a swipe-based model. And I think most of them that I’ve seen have been pretty different from what we’re building at Known,” she said.\n"

    "description": "TechCrunch looks back at the biggest data breaches, disruptive cyberattacks, and damaging hacks of 2025, from the raiding of U.S. government databases to a hack every month in South Korea.",
    "body": "\nEvery year, TechCrunch looks back at the cybersecurity horror shows of the past 12 months — from the biggest data breaches to hacks resulting in weeks of disruption — to see what we can learn. This year, the data breaches were like nothing we’ve seen before. \nHere’s our look back at some of the biggest security incidents of 2025, starting with:\nThe U.S. federal government was breached, several times over\nThe U.S. government remained one of the biggest targets in cyberspace. The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw. \nAll the while, the Russian hackers were stealing sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.\nBut nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, with a visible black eye, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.Image Credits:Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images\nThe Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, violated federal protocols and defied common security practices. They ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data, despite warnings of the national security risks and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.\nMusk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that they could face federal charges without his protection.\nHackers are extorting dozens of companies whose Oracle E-Business servers were breached\nIn late September, senior executives at American corporate giants began receiving threatening emails from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.\nMonths earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from dozens of organizations that rely on Oracle’s software.\nOracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was scrambling to patch the vulnerability. It was too late, though: The hackers had already stolen gobs of data from universities, hospitals and health systems, media organizations, and more.\nThis was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as GoAnywhere, MOVEit, and Cleo Software, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.\nHacker collective steals at least 1 billion records from Salesforce databases\nSalesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud. \nHackers targeted at least two companies, Salesloft and Gainsight, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce. \nBy breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, LinkedIn, SonicWall, and Verizon.\nA hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a data leak site advertising the stolen records in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.\nHackers ransack the U.K. retail sector, and disrupt operations at Jaguar Land Rover, denting the economy\nHackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from Marks & Spencer and at least 6.5 million customer records from the Co-op. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out. Luxury store Harrods was also later hacked.\nAn aerial view of JLR signage at the Jaguar Land Rover vehicle manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich on September 30, 2025 in Birmingham, United Kingdom, following its hack and data breach.Image Credits:Christopher Furlong / Getty Images\nBut a major cyberattack targeting Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s biggest employers, left a dent in the U.K. economy. A September hack and data breach saw JLR’s car plant stall production for months as the company worked to get its systems back up and running. \nThe fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown. \nU.K. security experts said the breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.\nSouth Korea sees months of hacks and data breaches\nSouth Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.\nThe country’s largest phone company, SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a massive data center fire wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.\nBut the cherry on the data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The data theft began in June, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the company’s chief executive resigning.\n"

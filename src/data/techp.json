    "body": "\nApple is getting serious about succession planning, according to a new report in The Financial Times.\nThe company’s board and senior executives are reportedly preparing for the possibility that Tim Cook could step down as CEO as soon as early next year. This would come after Apple’s earnings report in late January, giving the new leadership team time to settle into their roles before Apple’s big events like the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\nThe 65-year-old Cook has been Apple’s chief executive since Steve Jobs resigned in 2011; he’s now served as CEO for longer than Jobs. Under his leadership, Apple has grown from a market capitalization of $350 billion to $4 trillion, although the company has apparently struggled to find the right direction with AI.\nNo final decisions have been made about Cook’s successor or the timing of his departure, the FT says. However, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus is reportedly seen as the most likely candidate for the company’s next CEO.\n"

The telltale sign that supposedly signals text written by AI has popped up everywhere in recent months, including in school papers, emails, comments, customer service chats, LinkedIn posts, online forums, ad copy, and more. The inclusion of the em dash has led people to criticize those writers for being lazy and turning to an AI chatbot to do their work.\nOf course, many have also argued for the em dash, saying it’s been a part of their writing well before LLMs adopted the punctuation. However, the fact that chatbots couldn’t seem to avoid its use made the so-called “ChatGPT hyphen” a newly objectionable addition to any text, even if they weren’t a reliable signal of content created by generative AI.\nThe problem had stumped OpenAI for some time, as ChatGPT users were unable to get the chatbot to stop using the symbol, even when they specifically asked it not to.\nNow, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company has fixed the problem. In a post on X, Altman writes, “If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do,” calling the update a “small-but-happy win.”\n\nSmall-but-happy win:If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it's supposed to do!— Sam Altman (@sama) November 14, 2025\n\nThe company explains in a post on Threads (where it forced ChatGPT to apologize for “ruining the em dash”) that ChatGPT will be better at not using the em dash if you instruct it not to via the custom instructions in your personalization settings. That means it won’t necessarily eliminate the em dash from its output by default, but you will at least have more control over the frequency of its appearance.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

Once sequestered, Charm can sell carbon removal credits to companies. Axios first reported on the startup’s deal with Boeing.\nAviation has made little progress on cutting its carbon emissions. That has left companies in the sector searching for alternatives. Carbon removal has emerged as a contender given that it has the potential to cost less than transitioning to sustainable aviation fuels.\nBy 2050, one study found that the aviation industry will need to spend at least $60 billion on carbon offsets to reach net zero emissions.\nCharm can also produce biochar, a substance that when applied to farm fields can help boost soil productivity, though those efforts are still in their infancy, according to data from carbon removal registry Isometric.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Two years ago, Charm sold 112,000 carbon removal credits to Frontier, the advanced market commitment, for $53 million, or about $470 per metric ton. Charm has said it wants to bring the cost down to about $50 per metric ton.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n"

    "body": "\nAfter a two-week blackout, YouTube TV and Disney announced Friday that they have reached a deal.\nIn addition to bringing Disney networks like ABC, ESPN, and FX back to YouTube’s streaming TV service, the deal will also see ESPN make its new direct-to-consumer service available on YouTube TV at no additional cost. YouTube will also be able to sell select Disney networks and the Disney+/Hulu bundle as part of different packages.\nIn a statement, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, described the deal as one that “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.”\n“We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,” the Disney executives added.\nYouTube also released a statement Friday saying that subscribers would see the affected channels restored “throughout the course of the day.” The company said, “We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf.”\nYouTube TV is meant to be a cable TV alternative for cord cutters, but like most cable TV providers, the service has had its share of disputes with major content providers — usually over how much money to pay them and how much flexibility it has to offer their content in different bundles.\nThe last time YouTube and Disney renegotiated in 2022, there was a similar (if significantly briefer) blackout. This time around, YouTube offered customers a $20 credit that they can apply to their next bill.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne survey even suggested that due to the Disney blackout, 24% of the service’s more than 10 million subscribers said they had already canceled their subscription or planned to do so soon. (A YouTube spokesperson said actual churn was “manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.”)\nIndeed, TechCrunch’s Amanda Silberling said the blackout was ruining her life because she couldn’t watch “Jeopardy!” Thankfully, her two-week nightmare is over.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nMeta is getting ready to launch third-party chat integration on WhatsApp in Europe, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant notes that the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires it to give users in Europe the option to chat with people using third-party messaging services that have chosen to make their apps interoperable.\n“Following successful small-scale tests over the past months, the option for WhatsApp users to chat with users of messaging apps BirdyChat and Haiket directly via third-party chats will soon be rolling out across Europe,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “This marks a significant milestone in Meta’s compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements.”\nUsers in Europe who have opted in to the third-party integration will be able to share messages, images, voice messages, videos, and files. The option to create groups with third-party users will launch once Meta’s partners are ready to support it, the company says.\nOver the coming months, users in the European Region will begin seeing a notification in the “Settings” tab that will explain the process of opting in to connect with people on third-party apps. Third-party integrations will only work on Android and iOS, not on desktops, web, or tablets.\nImage Credits:Meta\nOf course, connecting with people on other messaging apps is optional, and users can turn third-party chats on or off at any time.\nMeta says its partnerships with BirdyChat and Haiket are the result of a three-year collaboration with the European messaging services and the European Commission to develop a third-party chat solution that complies with DMA requirements. \nAdditionally, the company notes that third-party messaging must use the same level of end-to-end encryption as WhatsApp. Meta also says it has ensured that users will understand the differences between chats on WhatsApp and third-party chats.\nBack in September 2024, Meta shared what third-party chats on WhatsApp will look like, noting that users will be able to set up a designated folder for third-party messages or opt for a combined inbox. The company also said at the time that it would notify users each time a new third-party messaging app became available. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s budding satellite internet program is no longer called Project Kuiper. It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts.\nThe satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network’s location in what’s known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.”\nAs Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren’t well-served by traditional internet providers.\nBut, as TechCrunch previously noted, the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX’s Starlink service.\nAmazon didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nAn archived version of the main FAQ page for Kuiper — published in late 2024 — puts the aforementioned “mission” to serve those communities right at the top of the post. Affordability is mentioned three times throughout, with Amazon calling it a “key principle of Project Kuiper.” \n“Amazon has a longstanding commitment to low prices, and lots of experience building popular, low-cost devices like Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick,” reads the answer to a question on the archived post about how much Kuiper service will cost. “We’re applying a similar approach with Project Kuiper.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat question-and-answer about cost is now gone from the Leo FAQ, and there is no mention of “affordability” anywhere on the page.\nThe language at the top of the new FAQ is also different. It states that Leo is “Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite network, designed to provide fast, reliable internet to customers and communities beyond the reach of existing networks.” \nWhile the Leo FAQ mentions that poor connectivity can “create an economic disadvantage for people, businesses, and other organizations operating in unserved and underserved parts of the world,” the company is less specific than it used to be about putting those communities front and center in the customer pipeline.\nAmazon Leo’s new website is even more blatant about how it is prioritizing home and commercial internet service. It promotes the ability to make “seamless video calls, stream 4K videos,” and “handle your whole family’s internet needs,” as well as the fact that Leo is “[f]lexible, scalable, enterprise-ready.”\nThe idea of using Leo “even in rural and remote locations” is brought up as almost an afterthought on the main website, and there is no mention of cost or affordability.\nDespite all this, on Thursday, Amazon posted a flashy video about the name change on X. Among other things, it shows a kid using her computer to do homework, professional drift racing, ambulance workers on a remote road, a farmer using a tablet, and a couple dancing in a laundromat. Along with the video, it wrote: “New name, same mission.” \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAndy Konwinski is concerned that the U.S. is losing its dominance in AI research to China, calling the shift an “existential” threat to democracy. Konwinski is a Databricks co-founder and the co-founder of the AI research and venture capital firm Laude.\n“If you talk to PhD students at Berkeley and Stanford in AI right now, they’ll tell you that they’ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies,” Konwinski said onstage at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit this week.  \nIn addition to investing through Laude, the venture fund he launched last year with NEA veteran Pete Sonsini and Antimatter CEO Andrew Krioukov, Konwinski also runs the Laude Institute, an accelerator that offers grants to researchers.\nMajor AI labs, including OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, continue to innovate significantly, yet their innovations remain largely proprietary rather than open source. Moreover, these companies are sucking up top academic talent by offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf what these experts can earn in universities.\nKonwinski argued that for ideas to truly flourish, they need to be freely exchanged and discussed with the larger academic community. He pointed out that generative AI emerged as a direct result of the Transformer architecture, a pivotal training technique introduced in a freely available research paper.\n“The first nation that makes the next ‘Transformer architectural level’ breakthrough will have the advantage,” Konwinski said.\nKonwinski argues that in China, the government supports and encourages AI innovation, whether from labs like DeepSeek or Alibaba’s Qwen, to be open sourced, which allows others to build upon them and which, he contends, will inevitably lead to more breakthroughs.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe believes this stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where, as he puts it, “the diffusion of scientists talking to scientists that we always have had in the United States, it’s dried up.”\nKonwinski argues that this trend poses not only a risk to democracy but also a business threat to major U.S. AI labs. “We’re eating our corn seeds; the fountain is drying up. Fast-forward five years, the big labs are gonna lose too,” he said. “We need to make sure the United States stays number one and open.” \n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

The single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago.”\nThe legal dispute between Masimo and Apple focuses on pulse oximetry, which uses an optical sensor to detect blood flow. Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees — including its chief medical officer — and infringing its patents on pulse oximetry technology. \nThe U.S. International Trade Commission sided by Masimo in 2023, banning Apple from importing Apple Watches with blood oxygen monitoring features — which is why Apple Watches have not supported blood oxygen monitoring in recent years.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThen Apple announced in August of this year that it’s introducing a new version of the feature designed to circumvent the ban, with blood oxygen readings measured and calculated on the user’s paired iPhone, rather than the Apple Watch itself.\nMasimo is suing U.S. Customs and Border Patrol for approving the import of Apple Watches with the new blood oxygen implementation, while Apple has asked an appeals court to overturn the import ban.\nApple also countersued Masimo, winning the statutory minimum payment of $250 when a jury found that Masimo had violated Apple design patents.\nThis post has been updated with more details from Apple’s statement.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nAfter a year of frenzied dealmaking and rumors of an upcoming IPO, the financial scrutiny into OpenAI is intensifying. Leaked documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron provide more of a glimpse into OpenAI’s financials — specifically its revenue and compute costs over the past couple of years.  \nZitron reported this week that in 2024, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI. In the first three quarters of 2025, that number jumped to $865.8 million, according to documents he viewed.\nOpenAI reportedly shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft as part of a previous deal where the software giant invested over $13 billion in the powerful AI startup. (Neither the startup nor the people in Redmond have publicly confirmed this percentage.)\nHowever, this is where things get a little sticky, because Microsoft also shares revenue with OpenAI, kicking back about 20% of the revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Bing is powered by OpenAI, and the OpenAI Service sells cloud access to OpenAI’s models to developers and businesses.  \nThe source also told TechCrunch that the leaked payments refer to Microsoft’s net revenue share, not the gross revenue share. In other words, they don’t include whatever Microsoft paid to OpenAI from Bing and Azure OpenAI royalties. Microsoft deducts those figures from its internally reported revenue share numbers, according to this person.\nMicrosoft doesn’t break out how much it makes from Bing and Azure OpenAI in its financial statements, so it’s difficult to estimate how much the tech giant is kicking back.\nNevertheless, the leaked documents provide a window into the hottest company on the private markets today — and not just how much it makes in revenue, but also how much it’s spending in comparison to that revenue.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo, based on that widely reported 20% revenue-share statistic, we can infer that OpenAI’s revenue was at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 — but very likely to be more. Previous reports from The Information put OpenAI’s 2024 revenue at around $4 billion, and its revenue from the first half of 2025 at $4.3 billion.  \nAltman also recently said OpenAI’s revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year, will end the year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate (which is a projection, not guidance on actual revenue), and that the company could even hit $100 billion by 2027. \nPer Zitron’s analysis, OpenAI may have spent roughly $3.8 billion on inference in 2024. That spend increased to roughly $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference is the compute used to run a trained AI model to generate responses.  \nOpenAI has historically almost exclusively relied on Microsoft Azure to provide compute access, though it has also struck deals with CoreWeave and Oracle, and more recently with AWS and Google Cloud. \nPrevious reports put OpenAI’s entire compute spend at roughly $5.6 billion for 2024 and its “cost of revenue” at $2.5 billion for the first half of 2025.  \nA source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that while OpenAI’s training spend is mostly non-cash — meaning, paid by credits Microsoft awarded OpenAI as part of its investment — the firm’s inference spend is largely cash. (Training refers to the compute resources needed to initially train a model.)\nWhile not a complete picture, these numbers imply that OpenAI could be spending more on inference costs than it is earning in revenue. \nAnd those implications promise to add to the incessant AI bubble chatter that has seeped into every conversation from New York City to Silicon Valley. If model giant OpenAI really still is in the red running its models, what might this mean for the massive investments at jaw-dropping valuations for the rest of the AI world?\nOpenAI declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

But the consequences of self-favoring go far beyond the amount awarded. We will continue to fight – because market abuse must have consequences and must not become a lucrative business model that is worthwhile despite fines and compensation payments,” Idealo’s co-founder and CEO Albrecht von Sonntag said in a statement.\nGoogle said it intends to appeal both rulings. “The changes we made in 2017 are working well, with no intervention from the European Commission. The number of price comparison sites in Europe using the remedy Shopping Unit has multiplied from seven then to 1,550 today,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company added that it offers rival comparison shopping services the same opportunity as Google Shopping to display ads, and said Google Shopping operates as if it were a separate business, participating in auctions the same as everyone else.\nThe ruling follows close on the heels of an EU investigation into how Google’s spam policy affects publishers’ search rankings. The company was recently fined €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion) by the EU for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services. \nNote: This story was updated to add a comment from Google.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nTesla has published the most detailed look at the performance and relative safety of its advanced driver-assistance software, just a few weeks after Waymo’s co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana at TechCrunch Disrupt called on companies to release more data.\nOn a new section of its website, Tesla claims that in North America, owners using the company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software are driving around 5 million miles before a major collision and around 1.5 million miles before a minor collision.\nThat’s a far lower rate than the national average based on statistics provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). That data shows people get in a major collision every 699,000 miles, and a minor one every 229,000, at least according to Tesla’s interpretation.\nTesla has been releasing “vehicle safety reports” on a quarter-by-quarter basis for a while. But those reports have been repeatedly panned for being insufficient. And Tesla has released almost no information about the safety performance of the Robotaxi trial it’s been running in Austin, Texas, this year, which still has employees in the driver’s seat monitoring for safety reasons.\nWaymo, the leading robotaxi company in the U.S. at the moment based on cars deployed and customers served, has published detailed data showing its vehicles are around 5x safer than human drivers, and 12x safer with respect to pedestrians. At last month’s Disrupt conference, Mawakana was asked to name other companies she felt were making roads safer.\n“I don’t know who’s on that list, because they’re not telling us what’s happening with their fleets,” said Mawakana, without naming Tesla.\n“I think there is a responsibility, if you’re going to put vehicles on the road, and you’re going to remove the driver from behind the wheel, and you’re going to have someone in some other room observing the fleet who can take over their vehicles, it is incumbent upon you to be transparent about what’s happening,” she added. “And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaymo didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday about whether Mawakana believes Tesla’s new data is sufficient.\nOne of the repeated criticisms of Tesla’s quarterly safety reports is that it focused on Autopilot, a far less advanced driver-assistance system than the Full Self Driving (Supervised) software, or FSD — which, despite its name, does not make a car fully autonomous. Autopilot was designed to be used on highways, which typically see a lower rate of crashes (when including minor collisions).\nTesla has finally broken out all this data. The new section of Tesla’s website claims that drivers using FSD travel about 2.9 million miles between major collisions, while NHTSA data shows all drivers travel about 505,000 miles per major collision. Tesla claims FSD users drive about 986,000 miles between minor collisions, while NHTSA data shows all drivers travel around 178,000 miles per minor collision.\nTesla is also finally showing how it defines these terms for the first time. \nThe carmaker is using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, specifically 49 C.F.R. § 563.5. Tesla defines “major collisions” as crashes with higher-severity impacts where a vehicle’s airbags “or other non-reversible pyrotechnic restraints” are deployed. The company also says that if FSD was active “at any point within five seconds leading up to a collision event,” then it includes that crash in this dataset.\n“This calculation ensures that our reported collision rates for FSD (Supervised) capture not only collisions that occur while the system is actively controlling the vehicle, but also scenarios where a driver may disengage the system or where the system aborts on its own shortly before impact,” Tesla says.\nIn its FAQ section, Tesla states that it will update the data every quarter and that it will “reflect a rolling twelve-month aggregation of miles and collisions in an effort to remain relevant to recent trends and progress.” The company says it won’t release other information, like injury rates, because it is collecting this data automatically from the vehicles.\n“Instead, Tesla focuses on objective and programmatic metrics such as collision frequency and airbag deployment rates. Airbag deployments serve as a reliable proxy for collision severity,” the company writes.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "description": "According to a new report from the International Energy Agency, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers this year — $40 billion more than will be spent finding new oil supplies.",
    "body": "\nAccording to a new report from the International Energy Agency, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers this year — $40 billion more than will be spent finding new oil supplies.\nThose numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.\nKirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.\nThere’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.\nWe also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed  $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\nKirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.\nBut of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.\nRebecca: I mean, it’s a lot. And a lot of that’s coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.\nAnd another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there’s a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it’s just good business, it’s not because of any environmentally friendly policies.\nKirsten: Redwood Materials’ new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they’re taking the old EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled, and then they’re creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.\nThe question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.\nAnthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they’re not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.\nAnd then, of course, there’s also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are]  actually going to get built because there’s definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.\nTo start with OpenAI, that’s a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. \nI think that this is going to be an effort that’s not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that’s going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor. Previously, he worked as a tech reporter at Adweek, a senior editor at VentureBeat, a local government reporter at the Hollister Free Lance, and vice president of content at a VC firm.

    "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice said five people — including four U.S. nationals — \"facilitated\" North Korean IT workers to get jobs at American companies, allowing the regime to earn money from their remote labor.",
    "body": "\nFive people have pleaded guilty to helping North Koreans defraud U.S. companies by posing as remote IT workers, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday.\nThe five people are accused of working as “facilitators” who helped North Koreans get jobs by providing their own real identities, or false and stolen identities of more than a dozen U.S. nationals. The facilitators also hosted company-provided laptops in their homes across the U.S. to make it look like the North Korean workers lived locally, according to the DOJ press release.\nThese actions affected 136 U.S. companies and netted Kim Jong Un’s regime $2.2 million in revenue, said the DOJ.\nThe latest round of guilty pleas is part of a years-long effort by American authorities to disrupt North Korea’s ability to make money from cybercrime. For years, North Korea has successfully infiltrated hundreds of Western companies posing as remote IT workers — as well as investors and recruiters — as part of a scheme to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program. In recent years, the U.S. government has fought back, indicting people involved in the scheme, and imposing sanctions on international fraud networks. \n“These prosecutions make one point clear: the United States will not permit [North Korea] to bankroll its weapons programs by preying on American companies and workers,” U.S. Attorney Jason A. Reding Quiñones said in a press release. “We will keep working with our partners across the Justice Department to uncover these schemes, recover stolen funds, and pursue every individual who enables North Korea’s operations.”\nThree of the people — U.S. nationals Audricus Phagnasay, Jason Salazar, and Alexander Paul Travis — each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy. \nProsecutors accused the three of helping North Koreans posing as legitimate IT workers, whom they knew worked outside of the United States, to use their own identities to obtain employment, helped them remotely access their company-issued laptops set up in their homes, and also helped the North Koreans pass vetting procedures, such as drug tests. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTravis, who prosecutors said was an active servicemember of the U.S. Army at the time of the scheme, earned more than $50,000 for these actions, while Phagnasay and Salazar were paid at least $3,500 and $4,500, respectively. The scheme saw U.S. companies pay around $1.28 million in salaries, most of which was sent to the North Korean IT workers overseas, per the DOJ.\nThe fourth U.S. national who pleaded guilty is Erick Ntekereze Prince, who ran a company called Taggcar, which supplied to U.S. companies allegedly “certified” IT workers but whom he knew worked outside of the country and were using stolen or fake identities. Prince also hosted laptops with remote access software at several residences in Florida, and earned more than $89,000 for his work, the DOJ said. \nAnother participant in the scheme who pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy and another count of aggravated identity theft is Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko, who prosecutors accuse of stealing U.S. citizens’ identities and selling them to North Koreans so they could get jobs at more than 40 U.S. companies. \nAccording to the press release, Didenko earned hundreds of thousands of dollars for this service. Didenko agreed to forfeit $1.4 million as part of his guilty plea.\nThe DOJ also announced that it had frozen and seized more than $15 million in cryptocurrency stolen in 2023 by North Korean hackers from several crypto platforms. \nCrypto companies, exchanges, and blockchain projects, have become one of the favorite targets for North Korean hackers, who stole more than $650 million in crypto in 2024, and more than $2 billion so far this year.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

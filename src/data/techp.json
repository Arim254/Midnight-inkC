Using Google’s Gemini AI models, this Siri update will reportedly be the first to live up to the promises Apple made in June 2024, with the ability to complete tasks by accessing user’s personal data and on-screen content.\nAnd that’s ahead of an even bigger upgrade that Apple plans to announce in June, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Gurman says. This version of Siri is supposed to be more conversational, in the style of other chatbots like ChatGPT, and it could run directly on Google’s cloud infrastructure.\nEarlier reports suggested that Apple has been struggling to get its AI strategy back on-track. In fact, Gurman says Apple’s Mike Rockwell told foundation team members over the summer that one of Gurman’s earlier reports was “bulls–t.” But with the Google partnership, as well as the recent departure of Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea, it seems the company has indeed found a new direction.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

To justify dismissing the SEC’s case, the new filing points to a 2024 settlement between New York and Gemini, with investors ultimately receiving “one hundred percent of the crypto assets they had loaned […] through the Gemini Earn program.”\nThis appears to be a larger pattern of leniency from the Trump administration towards the crypto industry.

    "body": "\nApple on Monday introduced the next version of its AirTag, which will now feature a longer Bluetooth range, a louder speaker, and improved precision finding capabilities. The latter is powered by Apple’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, which is also found in the iPhone 17 devices, iPhone Air, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3.\nWith Precision Finding, the new AirTag can offer haptic, visual, and audio feedback to guide users to their lost items. Now, those finding capabilities extend up to 50% farther away with the prior generation, Apple claims. The upgraded Bluetooth chip, meanwhile, also helps extend the range at which items can be located. \nNotably, with this update, Precision Finding will be accessible from the Apple Watch Series 9 or later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later. \n\nThe device’s speaker is also 50% louder than the prior generation, which means you can hear the AirTag’s beep from up to 2 times farther away than before. \nThe AirTag devices will also integrate with Share Item Location, an iOS feature that allows users to temporarily share the AirTag’s location with third parties. Today, 50 airlines are partnered with Apple for luggage tracking. \nOne thing that hasn’t changed is the AirTag’s price: it’s still $29 for a single AirTag and $99 for a four-pack, including free personalized engraving.\n\nFirst launched in 2021, AirTag quickly came to dominate the market for Bluetooth-connected lost item finders, essentially forcing previous market leaders like Tile to quickly find an exit. The company alleged that Apple was unfairly competing as its finding network was instantly as big as the iPhone install base, and Apple was pushing AirTag rivals to integrate with its own Find My app. Other companies, like Chipolo, took Apple up its offer to work with Find My and competed against AirTag with products that work across iOS and Android, or that have different features, like rechargeable batteries. \nStill, Apple’s AirTag remains the one to beat, with third-party estimates suggesting that nearly 70% of trackers sold in the latter part of 2024 were AirTag devices. Apple does not disclose its AirTag sales.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn recent months, some of the major players in science fiction and popular culture have been taking firmer stances against generative AI.\nSeparate decisions by San Diego Comic-Con and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) illustrate the depth of AI opposition within some creative communities — though they’re certainly not the only ones, with music distribution platform Bandcamp also recently banning generative AI.\nBack in December, when SFWA announced that it was updating its rules for the Nebula Awards. Works written entirely by large language models would not be eligible, while authors who used LLMs “at any point during the writing process” had to disclose that use, allowing award voters to make their own decisions about whether that usage would affect their support.\nAs Jason Sanford reported in his Genre Grapevine newsletter, this change drew immediate backlash for seemingly opening the door to work partly created by LLMs. SFWA’s Board of Directors issued an apology a few days later, writing, “Our approach and wording was wrong and we apologize for the distress and distrust we caused.”\nThe rules were revised yet again, now stating that works that are “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model (LLM) tools are not eligible” for Nebula Awards and that work will be disqualified if LLMs were used at any point in its creation.\nIn a follow-up post, Sanford said he was pleased to see SFWA listen to its members, and he said he refuses to use gen AI in his own fiction writing — “not only because of this theft but also because the tools are not actually creative and defeat the entire point of storytelling.” Still, he wrote that important questions need to be answered about how broadly LLM usage will be defined, especially as “these generative AI products are being forced down everyone’s throats by major corporations.”\n“If you use any online search engines or computer products these days, it’s likely you’re using something powered by or connected with an LLM,” Sanford said. “Because of that, we must be careful that writers who use word processing and research tools with LLM components aren’t unfairly disqualified from awards like the Nebulas or attacked by readers and other writers. “\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe massive annual San Diego Comic-Con faced a similar controversy this month after artists noticed rules allowing AI-generated art to be displayed — but not sold — at the convention’s art show. After artists complained, the rules were quietly changed to say, “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show.”\nWhile Comic-Con’s apology was less public than SFWA, some artists shared emailed responses from art show head Glen Wooten, who apparently said the previous rules had been in place for “a few years” and that they’d been effective as a deterrent, since no one had entered AI-generated art in the show.\n“But the issue is becoming more of a problem, so more strident language is necessary: NO! Plain and simple,” Wooten reportedly said.\nIt’s probably safe to that assume other organizations will be announcing similarly hard-line stances this year — and that these communities will continue debating the larger issues. \n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor. Previously, he worked as a tech reporter at Adweek, a senior editor at VentureBeat, a local government reporter at the Hollister Free Lance, and vice president of content at a VC firm.

    "body": "\nNvidia said on Monday it has invested $2 billion in CoreWeave to hasten the data center company’s efforts to add more than 5 gigawatts of AI computing capacity by 2030.\nThe chipmaker, already an investor in CoreWeave, said it had bought the company’s Class A shares at $87.20 per share. As part of the deal, CoreWeave and Nvidia plan to together build “AI factories” (data centers) that would use the chipmaker’s products. \nCoreWeave will also integrate Nvidia’s products across its platform, including the new Rubin chip architecture (set to replace the current Blackwell architecture), Bluefield storage systems, as well as the chipmaker’s new CPU line, Vera. \nThe deal is a strong show of support for CoreWeave, which has come under scrutiny over the past few months for raising billions in debt to continue building out its data center operations. The company had $18.81 billion in debt obligations as of September 2025, according to PitchBook data, and it reported revenue of $1.36 billion in the third quarter.\nThe company’s CEO Michael Intrator has defended its business model (funding operations by raising debt with its GPUs as collateral), and has addressed concerns of circular deals in the AI industry by saying companies have to “work together” to address a “violent change in supply and demand.”\nThe company has managed to successfully ride the AI wave since its transition from a crypto mining company to a provider of data center services for AI training and inference. And since its IPO in March last year, it has been busy fleshing out its technology stack with a slew of acquisitions. It acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, and then soon after bought reinforcement learning startup OpenPipe. In October, it agreed to acquire Marimo (an open-source Jupyter notebook competitor) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI.\nThe company currently counts several hyperscalers as customers, including OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs part of the deal, Nvidia will also help CoreWeave buy land and power for data centers, and work with the smaller company to include its AI software and architecture within Nvidia’s reference architecture to sell to cloud businesses and enterprises. \nCoreWeave’s shares were up more than 15% following news of the deal.\nFor Nvidia, arguably the biggest benefactor and driver of the AI boom, the deal is the latest of several dozen investments in the past year as the company does its best to continue fueling the precipitous pace of investment in, and development of, the nascent technology. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nThe delayed first test of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship rocket is now slated for mid-March, according to a post from CEO Elon Musk on his social media site X.\nThis third version of Starship, or V3, is larger and more powerful. Crucially, the company plans to use Starship V3 to launch its next-generation Starlink satellites, which will be capable of faster data speeds but weigh more and are larger. It’s also the first version of the rocket that is meant to dock with other Starships in Earth orbit, a capability the company needs in order to reach the moon or Mars.\nThis all comes as SpaceX is racing toward an IPO later this year, and under pressure from the Trump administration to return U.S. astronauts to the surface of the moon before the end of his second term. Starship, the most powerful rocket ever developed, is currently a key part of NASA’s mission to fulfill that goal.\nSpaceX was making progress toward a launch of Starship V3 in late 2025. But in November, the booster stage suffered an explosion during testing that blew out an entire side of the steel rocket. The company said it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened, but has yet to offer a more detailed breakdown of what went wrong.\nThe company has been hoping to move on from the second version of Starship, which was a mixed bag. It was able to successfully reach orbit with Starship V2, deploy dummy versions of the next-generation Starlink satellites, and catch multiple booster stages after they returned to the launchpad. \nBut Starship V2 also suffered a number of explosions and setbacks of its own. Some of those came as a result of SpaceX’s developmental approach, which involves pushing the test vehicles to — or past — their limit and then iterating based on what the company learns. Others were more unexpected, like when one of the Starship vehicles that sits atop the booster stage erupted in a massive fireball during ground testing last June.\nSpaceX has come to dominate the global launch market over the last decade, and it is relying on Starship to maintain that dominance. But competition is creeping in at the edges. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin launched its first mega-rocket, known as New Glenn, for the first time in January 2025 and again in November. The company launched its inaugural commercial payload for NASA on that second flight and also completed the first landing of its booster stage.\nBlue Origin is planning a third launch of New Glenn in late February and hopes to send its own lunar lander to the moon sometime after that. While New Glenn is smaller than Starship, Blue Origin revealed late last year that it is developing a larger version of the vehicle that more directly competes with SpaceX’s super-heavy rocket. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft has announced the launch of its latest chip, the Maia 200, which the company describes as a silicon workhorse designed for scaling AI inference.\nThe 200, which follows the company’s Maia 100 released in 2023, has been technically outfitted to run powerful AI models at faster speeds and with more efficiency, the company has said. Maia comes equipped with over 100 billion transistors, delivering over 10 petaflops in 4-bit precision and approximately 5 petaflops of 8-bit performance—a substantial increase over its predecessor.\nInference refers to the computing process of running a model, in contrast with the compute required to train it. As AI companies mature, inference costs have become an increasingly important part of their overall operating cost, leading to renewed interest in ways to optimize the process.\nMicrosoft is hoping that the Maia 200 can be part of that optimization, making AI businesses run with less disruption and lower power use. “In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,” the company said.\nMicrosoft’s new chip is also part of a growing trend of tech giants turning to self-designed chips as a way to lessen their dependence on NVIDIA, whose cutting-edge GPUs have become increasingly pivotal to AI companies’ success. Google, for instance, has its TPU, the tensor processing units—which aren’t sold as chips but as compute power made accessible through its cloud. Then there’s Amazon Trainium, the e-commerce giant’s own AI accelerator chip, which just launched its latest version, the Trainium3, in December. In each case, the TPUs can be used to offload some of the compute that would otherwise be assigned to NVIDIA GPUs, lessening the overall hardware cost.\nWith Maia, Microsoft is positioning itself to compete with those alternatives. In its press release Monday, the company noted that Maia delivers 3x the FP4 performance of third generation Amazon Trainium chips, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\nMicrosoft says that Maia is already hard at work fueling the company’s AI models from its Superintelligence team.

    "body": "\nIn the run-up to the winter storm currently pummeling much of the U.S., weather forecasts for some regions were all over the map, with snowfall predictions varying wildly. \nNvidia couldn’t have timed the release of its new Earth-2 weather forecasting models any better. Or, given how accurate the company claims the new models are, maybe it knew something we didn’t?\nThe new AI models promise to make weather forecasting faster and more accurate. Nvidia claims that one model in particular, Earth-2 Medium Range, beats Google DeepMind’s AI weather model, GenCast, on more than 70 variables. GenCast, which Google released in December 2024, was itself significantly more accurate than existing weather models that were capable of generating forecasts up to 15 days out.\nNvidia announced the new tools Monday at the American Meteorological Society meeting in Houston.\n“Philosophically, scientifically, it’s a return to simplicity,” Mike Pritchard, director of climate simulation at Nvidia, told reporters on a call before the meeting. “We’re moving away from hand-tailored niche AI architectures and leaning into the future of simple, scalable, transformer architectures.”\nTraditionally, most weather forecasts rely on simulations of physics as observed in the real world. AI models are a relatively recent addition. The Earth-2 Medium Range model is based on a new Nvidia architecture called Atlas, about which the company said it would release more details on Monday. \nAlongside Medium Range, Nvidia’s Earth-2 suite includes a Nowcasting model and Global Data Assimilation model.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNowcasting produces short-term predictions from zero to six hours into the future, and it’s aimed at helping meteorologists forecast the impacts of storms and other hazardous weather. \n“Because this model is trained directly on globally available geostationary satellite observations, rather than region-specific physics model outputs, Nowcasting’s approach can be adapted anywhere on the planet with good satellite coverage,” Pritchard said. That should help governments of states and smaller countries understand how severe weather systems might affect their territories.\nThe Global Data Assimilation model uses data from sources like weather stations and balloons to produce continuous snapshots of weather conditions at thousands of locations around the world. Those snapshots are then used as launching points for weather models to make their predictions. \nTraditionally, those snapshots have required tremendous amounts of computing power before the forecasting work could begin. “It consumes roughly 50% of the total supercomputing loads of traditional weather [forecasting],” Pritchard said. “This model can do that in minutes on GPUs instead of hours on supercomputers.”\nThe three new models join two existing ones: CorrDiff, which uses coarse-grained forecasts to generate speedy, high-resolution predictions, and FourCastNet3, which models individual weather variables like temperature, wind, and humidity.\nPritchard said that the new models should give more users access to powerful weather forecasting tools, which have historically been the domain of wealthier countries and large corporations, which have the funds to pay for costly supercomputer time.\n“This provides the fundamental building blocks used by everyone in the ecosystem — national meteorological services, financial service firms, energy companies — anyone who wants to build and refine weather forecasting models,” Pritchard said. Some of the tools are already in use. Meteorologists in Israel and Taiwan have been using Earth-2 CorrDiff, for example, while The Weather Company and Total Energies are evaluating Nowcasting, Nvidia said.\n“For some users, it makes sense to subscribe to an enterprise centralized weather forecasting system. But for others like countries, sovereignty matters,” Pritchard said. “Weather is a national security issue, and sovereignty and weather are inseparable.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nBritish startup Synthesia, whose AI platform helps companies create interactive training videos, has raised a $200 million Series E round of funding that brings its valuation to $4 billion — up from $2.1 billion just a year ago.\nUnlike some other AI startups that are still a long way from turning a profit, Synthesia has found a lucrative business in transforming corporate training thanks to AI-generated avatars. With enterprise clients including Bosch, Merck, and SAP, the London-based company crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April 2025.\nThis milestone explains why Synthesia’s venture backers are literally doubling down. The Series E that nearly doubled its valuation was led by existing investor GV (Google Ventures), with participation from several other previous backers — including Series B lead Kleiner Perkins, Series C lead Accel, Series D lead New Enterprise Associates (NEA), NVIDIA’s venture capital arm NVentures, Air Street Capital, and PSP Growth. \nAside from ongoing support, this round will bring both new and departing investors. On one hand, Matt Miller’s VC firm Evantic and the secretive VC firm Hedosophia are joining the cap table as new entrants. On the other hand, Synthesia will facilitate an employee secondary sale in partnership with Nasdaq, TechCrunch has learned.\nTo be clear, Synthesia isn’t going public just yet — Nasdaq isn’t acting as a public exchange in this operation, but as a private markets facilitator that will help early team members turn their shares into cash. These employee stock sales often happen outside of this framework, but usually at prices either below or above the company’s official valuation, and are sometimes frowned upon by other shareholders. With this process, all sales will be tied to the same $4 billion valuation as Synthesia’s Series E, while the company keeps an element of control.\n“This secondary is first and foremost about our employees,” Synthesia CFO Daniel Kim told TechCrunch. “It gives employees a meaningful opportunity to access liquidity and share in the value they’ve helped create, while we continue to operate as a private company focused on long-term growth.”\nFor Synthesia, this long-term growth involves going beyond expressive videos and embracing the AI agents trend. According to a press release, the company is developing AI agents that will let its clients’ employees “interact with company knowledge in a more intuitive, human-like way by asking questions, exploring scenarios through role-play, and receiving tailored explanations.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company said early pilots have received positive feedback from customers, who reported higher engagement and faster knowledge transfer compared to traditional formats. This positive response explains why Synthesia now plans to make agents a “core strategic focus” to invest in, alongside further product improvements to its existing platform.\nWhile it didn’t disclose revenue forecasts, the company hopes its platform will offer a welcome answer to the struggles of enterprises in keeping their workforce adequately trained despite rapid changes. “We see a rare convergence of two major shifts: a technology shift with AI agents becoming more capable, and a market shift where upskilling and internal knowledge sharing have become board-level priorities,” Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli said in a statement.\nSeeing boards care more about employees as a result of AI wasn’t on anyone’s bingo card, except perhaps Riparbelli. Together with his cofounder, Synthesia COO Steffen Tjerrild, Riparbelli took the initiative of conducting a secondary sale so that employees could share in the success of the unicorn company. Founded in 2017, Synthesia now has more than 500 team members, a 20,000-square-foot HQ in London, and additional offices in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, New York City, and Zurich.\nWhile unusual for a British startup, this coordinated secondary sale isn’t a first and likely not a last, Synthesia’s head of corporate affairs and policy, Alexandru Voica told TechCrunch. “My guess is that as [U.K.-based] private companies stay private longer, this type of structured, cross-border employee liquidity may become increasingly common, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see others do it, either with Nasdaq or others,” he predicted.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "PopWheels realized its battery swapping network could be used for more than food delivery workers who need to charge their e-bikes. Now, its planning for an \"aggressive rollout\" this summer.",
    "body": "\nFood carts are a staple of New York City dining, dispensing everything from dosa and doner kebabs to dogs and dim sum in short order. But no matter how enticing the aroma of a cart’s food, the smelly gas generators that keep the lights on threaten to put customers off their meals.\nCart owners and customers may not have to suck on fumes much longer. A Brooklyn-based startup is testing the use of its e-bike batteries to power food carts, starting with La Chona Mexican on the corner of 30th and Broadway in Manhattan.\n“This really started out as a lark last summer,” David Hammer, co-founder and CEO of PopWheels, told TechCrunch. “I’m an ex-Googler from the early days, and this felt like a classic, old-school 20% project.”\nNormally, PopWheels battery packs are zipping around the city strapped to food delivery bikes. The team soon realized that connecting them to food carts was an avenue worth pursuing.\n“Are e-bike packs the perfect energy type to be powering food carts? Maybe, maybe not,” Hammer said. “I would argue it doesn’t matter. What matters is, can you solve distribution and charging?”\nIf a food cart needs more power, the owner can swap the battery packs midday.Image Credits:PopWheels\nPopWheels currently operates 30 charging cabinets around Manhattan, which serve gig workers riding e-bikes, most of whom use either Arrow or Whizz models. That’s resulted in a “de facto  decentralized fleet,” Hammer said, allowing the company to stock just a few different types of batteries to serve hundreds of customers.\nMany delivery workers ride into Manhattan from the farther reaches of the city. It’s a trip that can burn a significant portion of their charge, and many workers need two batteries to get through a full day. In response, bodegas started offering e-bike charging services, for which delivery workers typically pay $100 per month. When factoring in battery wear and tear, the total cost nears $2,000 per year, Hammer said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We can make the economics work so that we’re actually saving them money right off the bat,” he said. PopWheels charges customers $75 per month for unlimited access to its network, and Hammer said the company has a long waitlist.\nThe startup’s charging cabinets can hold 16 batteries, and PopWheels designed them to swiftly extinguish a battery fire should anything go awry during charging. (The company’s founding mission was to stamp out e-bike fires in New York City, which became a significant problem few years ago.) After building some initial cabinets, the company raised a $2.3 million seed round last year 2025.\nSwap sites are typically small open spaces like parking lots, which PopWheels has retrofit with fences and the necessary electrical connections to support several cabinets. Each cabinet draws about as much electricity as a Level 2 electric vehicle charger, which is to say not that much.\nAs PopWheels e-bike service grew, the startup began studying other opportunities. \n“There was always a little bit of an underlying thesis that there’s something bigger here,” Hammer said. “If you build urban-scale, fire-safe battery swapping infrastructure, you’re creating an infrastructure layer that lots of people are going to want to get on board with.”\nHammer started to think about alternative uses for the batteries after someone sent an article about how New York City was working to decarbonize food carts. That’s when the PopWheels team started running the numbers.\nFood carts, Hammer estimates, probably spend around $10 a day on gas for their generators to keep the lights on. (Most of the cooking is done via propane, which is a separate matter.) That’s about how much PopWheels would charge someone to subscribe to four of its batteries per day. Conveniently, four of its batteries can supply about five kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough to cover the low end of what a typical cart might draw. If they need more juice, Hammer said they can run to a swap station midday.\nAfter realizing the math penciled out, PopWheels built a prototype adapter and trialed it at a small event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard at last year’s New York Climate Week. Since then, the startup has been working with the the non-profit Street Vendor Project to move the idea forward. Last week’s demonstration with La Chona was the first time the batteries powered a food cart for a full day. \n“I had multiple food cart owners come up to me and say, ‘Wait, there’s no noise with this cart. What are you guys doing? Can I get this?’” Hammer said. \n“We are planning to roll this out aggressively starting this summer,” he said. “We think we could be cost neutral with gasoline for a food cart owner while solving all of the quality of life issues.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time. \nHumans&, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised a $480 million seed round to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “AI for empowering humans” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.\n“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch. \nHumans&’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.\nThe three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans& still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think Slack) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications. \n“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans& and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools. \n“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nZelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly. \nPart of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans& doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans& is designing the product in conjunction with the model.\n“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said. \nWhat is clear, though, is that humans& isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer. \nAI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a $43 million round at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings. \n“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman wrote on social media. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”\nThat’s the space where humans& wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.\nTo get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained. \n“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans& co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).\nLong-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in recent academic work as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps. \n“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said. \nDespite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute. \nThe top risk, though, is that humans& isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. \nCrucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans& a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&A is certainly a risk. \nHumans& told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired. \n“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”\nThis post was original published on January 22, 2026.\n"

    "body": "\nBig Tech companies and upcoming startups want to use generative AI to build software and hardware for kids. A lot of those experiences are limited to text or voice, and kids might not find that captivating. Three former Google employees want to get over that hurdle with their generative AI-powered interactive app, Sparkli.\nSparkli was founded last year by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang. As parents, Poojary and Kang were not able to satisfy their children’s curiosity or give engaging answers to their questions.\n“Kids, by definition, are very curious, and my son would ask me questions about how cars work or how it rains. My approach was to use ChatGPT or Gemini to explain these concepts to a six-year-old, but that is still a wall of text. What kids want is an interactive experience. This was our core process behind founding Sparkli,” Poojary told TechCrunch over a call.\nImage Credits:Sparkli\nPrior to launching Sparkli, Poojary and Kang co-founded a travel aggregator called Touring Bird and a video-focused social commerce app, Shoploop, at Google’s Area 120, the company’s internal startup incubator. Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.\n“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”\nThe startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”\nThe app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Sparkli\nPoojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further. \nThe startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.\nOne of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.\nThe company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.\n\n\n\nSparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.\n“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.\nWhile the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026. \nThe company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.\n“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.\nThis post was first published on January 22, 2026.\n"

The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced deals with Accenture as well.\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its “Frontier Alliance” initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new OpenAI Frontier AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with IBM and Deloitte.\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

While ad sales improved under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues were still lower than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition.\nAccording to eMarketer’s forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which Bloomberg confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.\nX says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re committed to empowering advertisers to hit their performance goals with greater ease and impact,” said Monique Pintarelli, head of global advertising at xAI, in a statement.

    "body": "\nEinride has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its public debut, which is expected for the first half of 2026. \nThe Swedish startup is most well-known for building both electric trucks and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. \nThe deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. \nEinride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.\nIn total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including $100 million previously announced crossover financing. \nThe SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses, though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. \nThe proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. \nOutside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers, including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. \nEinride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went public via a SPAC merger valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the SPAC road to the public market in 2025.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook.

Users who are part of the test can type “DM me” or “Message me” in a post or reply to automatically generate a hyperlink that invites others to start a private conversation with them.\nTapping on the shortcut will take you to a one-on-one direct messaging chat with the person.

If you don’t follow each other, the message is filtered through the “Message Requests” folder to prevent spam. \nThe company says the new shortcut removes the need to navigate to a person’s profile to start a DM conversation with them. \nWhile Threads was late to introduce a native DM feature, this latest move indicates that the social network is looking to make messaging a more central part of its platform, as it’s working to reduce the number of steps it takes to start a conversation. \nImage Credits:Threads\nThe new feature is rolling out to select users in the U.S. and Canada. As with any other test feature, it’s unknown when or if Threads plans to roll out the feature more widely. \nThe DM shortcut is just one of several new features that have rolled out on Threads in recent months. The social network recently introduced an AI-powered feature that lets users personalize their feed, and the ability to share posts directly to an Instagram Story without leaving the app. Plus, Threads was spotted exploring in-message games last month.\nThe additions come as a recent report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggested that Threads now surpasses X in daily mobile usage.

    "body": "\nCould Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nA rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade.\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\nImage Credits:IDC\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIDC added that it expects RAM prices to stabilize by mid-2027.\nLast year, another analyst firm, Counterpoint, also forecast a decline in smartphone shipments, but it projected a fall smaller dip of just 2.6%.\nEarlier this year, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei also warned that smartphones will cost more in 2026 as memory costs for smartphones rise. “Brands now face a simple choice: raise prices by 30% or more in some cases, or downgrade specs. The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.\nThe company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\n\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Read AI\nThe company said that while Ada currently works via email, it will soon be available on Slack and Teams.\nOn the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Shim told TechCrunch that the company now has over 5 million monthly active users and plans to grow that number to 10 million. He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally. \nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data. Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs for severance, Dorsey told U.S. employees who are being cut that they will receive “your salary for 20 weeks + 1 week per year of tenure, equity vested through the end of [M]ay, 6 months of health care, your corporate devices, and $5,000 to put toward whatever you need to help you in this transition.” Employees outside the U.S. will receive “similar support” dependent on their countries’ policies, he added.\nSalesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of other companies that have made enormous staffing cuts citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month cast some doubt on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023.

    "body": "\nAs space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTim Fernholz is a journalist who writes about technology, finance and public policy.

Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.\nSeveral governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, warned in an alert that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.”\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an imminent threat and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is currently running at reduced capacity due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.\nNeither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.\nIn December, Cisco warned of a similarly rated 10.0 vulnerability in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle today announced the latest version of its popular image generation model, Nano Banana 2. The new model, which is technically Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, can create more realistic images than its predecessor. The model will also now become the default in the Gemini app for its Fast, Thinking, and Pro modes.\nThe company first released Nano Banana in August 2025, prompting people to generate millions of images in the Gemini app, especially in countries like India. In November, the company released Nano Banana Pro, which allows users to create more detailed and high-quality images.\nThe new Nano Banana 2 retains some of the high-fidelity characteristics of the Pro model but produces images faster. The company says you can create images with a resolution ranging from 512px to 4K, in different aspect ratios.\nImage Credits:Google\nNano Banana 2 can maintain character consistency for up to five characters and fidelity of up to 14 objects in one workflow for better storytelling. Users can also issue complex requests with detailed nuances for image generation, Google says. In addition, users can create media with more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper detail.\nImage Credits:Google\nWith the launch, Nano Banana 2 will become the default model for image generation across all apps in the Gemini app. The company is also making it the default model for image generation in its video editing tool, Flow. \nIn Search, Nano Banana 2 will become the default for Google Search results via Google Lens and in AI Mode across 141 countries on the Google app and on the web across desktop and mobile.\nOn Google’s higher-end plans, Google AI Pro and Ultra, subscribers can continue to use Nano Banana Pro for specialized tasks by regenerating images via the three-dot menu.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nFor developers, Nano Banana 2 will be available in preview through the Gemini API, Gemini CLI, and the Vertex API.

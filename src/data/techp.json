The reason I came up with this is, if you look at the history of venture capital, it’s an asset that’s uncorrelated with other asset classes.”\n“And so the thinking for many allocators was you should allocate a certain percentage of your portfolio to this and more money should flow to venture capital, but the truth is that there are only so many companies that matter,” Botha continued. \n“In my opinion, throwing more money into Silicon Valley doesn’t yield more great companies. It actually dilutes that, it actually makes it harder for us to get that small number of special companies to flourish,” added Botha.\nBotha noted that there are currently 3,000 venture firms in the United States, while there were just 1,000 when he joined Sequoia 20 years ago.\n“When I joined Sequoia 2003 there were no mobile devices,” said Botha “Cloud computing didn’t exist. There were maybe 300 million people on the planet that had access to the internet. So the scale of the opportunity today is completely different. If you look technically at the numbers, I think for the last 20 years, there’s roughly been 380 billion-dollar-plus outcomes in the industry,” Botha said (meaning roughly 20 per year).\n“That’s a significant number, but I don’t think it will continue to scale just with more money going into the industry.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

He offered a potential future scenario where two business execs were negotiating a contract over Zoom. \nInstead of being on a call for a long time, they could send their digital twins to work together on the plan first, Yuan said. \nHe also spoke of how AI could assist with email, checking your messages for you, and help you figure out what was important and in need of a response. \nPlus, Yuan believes that AI could enhance Zoom’s broader suite of solutions, which includes things like an online whiteboard and collaborative docs.\n“Today, I need a manually focus on all those products to get work done. Eventually, AI will help,” Yuan said. \n“By doing that, we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?… Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That’s a goal,” he said. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

On the sidelines of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said vandalism against Waymo’s robotaxis is “not okay.”\n“Obviously, vandalism is a crime, so we’re very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet,” Mawakana told TechCrunch. “It doesn’t matter whose fleet it is. It’s not acceptable, it’s not okay, and so, damaging property? We’re not standing for it.”\nConcerns about privacy and surveillance have become a major issue in protests during the second Trump administration, especially as the government ramps up its deportation efforts. At the same time, a broader public resistance to tech companies — especially those enabling surveillance — has resulted in multiple Waymo vehicles being damaged and burned by vandals.\nDuring an interview on the main stage Monday, Mawakana reiterated her previous comments that Waymo refuses government requests for the footage Waymo vehicles capture if those requests are “overly broad and unlawful.”\nWhen asked backstage what Waymo is doing to change the perception of its vehicles, Mawakana pointed to the company’s push to put local artists’ designs on some cars as part of a broader effort to “make the fleet more a part of the community.” But while Waymo often pushes back on surveillance requests, she said the company has to “continue to work with first responders to help us address this challenge” of vandalism.\n“They don’t want it in their cities.

Meanwhile OpenAI’s “Instant Checkout” feature, launched in September, lets users confirm their order, shipping, and payment details, and complete purchases without leaving ChatGPT.\nCustomers can use their Paypal wallets for checkout, which, the company said, would enable it to provide buyer and seller protection, as well as dispute resolution. The company is also providing technology to handle card payments from within ChatGPT using a separate payments API.\nAnd next year, merchants using Paypal products will have their products be discoverable on ChatGPT, starting with categories like apparel, fashion, beauty, home improvement and electronics. Merchants will not need to build any integrations, as PayPal will handle merchant routing and payments behind the scenes.\nThe company said it is also launching an agentic commerce suite that would let merchants feature their catalogs within AI apps, accept payments on different AI apps, and get insights about consumer behavior.\nPayPal has been working to insert itself as a payments partner within various companies’ AI-enabled shopping experiences, particularly as people increasingly use AI apps to do their daily tasks. In May, the company teamed up with Perplexity to let users checkout within the AI search tool, and in September, Paypal said it was adopting Google’s Agent Payments Protocol to integrate its products within various Google products.\nPayPal said, apart from the partnership on commerce, the company is giving enterprise access to ChatGPT to all of its employees and allowing its engineers to make better use of OpenAI’s coding tools, Codex.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Hundreds of millions of people turn to ChatGPT each week for help with everyday tasks, including finding products they love, and over 400 million use PayPal to shop,” Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a statement. “By partnering with OpenAI and adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol, PayPal will power payments and commerce experiences that help people go from chat to checkout in just a few taps for our joint customer bases,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI is offering its ChatGPT Go plan available free of charge for one year to users in India who sign up during a limited promotional period starting November 4, as the company looks to expand in one of its top markets.\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI announced the promotion but did not specify how long the offer would remain available. Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers in India will also be eligible for the free 12-month plan, the company said.\nPriced at less than $5 per month, ChatGPT Go launched in India in August as OpenAI’s most affordable paid subscription plan. The service later expanded to Indonesia and, earlier this month, to 16 additional countries across Asia.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country with over 700 million smartphone users and more than a billion internet subscribers, has been a key market for OpenAI. The company opened its New Delhi office in August and is currently building a local team to expand its presence.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said India was the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. However, making money from ChatGPT’s paid plans in the country has proven challenging. The app saw over 29 million downloads in the 90 days leading up to August, but generated just $3.6 million in in-app purchases during that period, according to Appfigures data reviewed by TechCrunch at the time.\nChatGPT Go offers 10 times more usage than the free version for generating responses, creating images, and uploading files. It also features improved memory for more personalized responses, according to OpenAI.\n“Since initially launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we’ve seen from our users has been inspiring,” said Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, in a statement. “We’re excited to see the amazing things our users will build, learn, and achieve with these tools.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpenAI’s rivals, including Perplexity and Google, are also looking to tap into India’s large and youthful user base. Perplexity recently partnered with Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to the telecom operator’s 360 million subscribers. Similarly, Google introduced a free one-year AI Pro plan for students in India.\nOpenAI is set to host its DevDay Exchange developer conference Bengaluru on November 4, where it is expected to make India-specific announcements aimed at local developers and enterprises. India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing markets for ChatGPT, with millions of users engaging with the chatbot daily, the company said.\n\nExcited for our first DevDay Exchange event in India 🇮🇳 on November 4.

    "body": "\nAdobe today released new AI assistants Creative Cloud products, Express and Photoshop, that can help users with image creation and editing.\nMost companies like to put AI assistants into a sidebar in their products to grab on-screen context. But for Express, Adobe has created a new mode that lets you use text prompts to create new images and designs. You can switch on the assistant mode to use AI prompts and then switch back to use editing tools and controls that are available in Express in the current version.\nMeanwhile, the new Photoshop assistant, which is in closed beta testing, lives in the sidebar. Adobe claims the assistant can understand different layers and help you automatically select objects and create masks. Adobe added that users can ask the assistant to complete repetitive tasks such as removing backgrounds or changing colors.\nImage credits: Adobe\nAdobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, told TechCrunch that the company decided to build a different mode for its AI assistant in Express to target students and professionals who use the app. The company wants to see if users can achieve what they want to do without having to switch back to the traditional interface, he explained.\n“We think this approach of switching between two modes, where you get the best of both worlds, is gonna make the technology both accessible and controllable,” Costin said.\nThe company said it is also experimenting with a new type of assistant, dubbed “Project Moonlight,” that can coordinate with different assistants from other Adobe tools, and connect to a creator’s social channels to better understand their style. Adobe said the product is in the early stages of development and is in private beta.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nThe company said it is also exploring a way to connect Adobe Express with ChatGPT using OpenAI’s app integrations API to let users create designs directly in ChatGPT.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdobe also announced a new set of AI features for its Creative Cloud apps.

    "body": "\nOpenAI released new data on Monday illustrating how many of ChatGPT’s users are struggling with mental health issues and talking to the AI chatbot about it. The company says that 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have “conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Given that ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to more than a million people a week.\nThe company says a similar percentage of users show “heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT,” and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the AI chatbot.\nOpenAI says these types of conversations in ChatGPT are “extremely rare,” and thus difficult to measure. That said, the company estimates these issues affect hundreds of thousands of people every week.\nOpenAI shared the information as part of a broader announcement about its recent efforts to improve how models respond to users with mental health issues. The company claims its latest work on ChatGPT involved consulting with more than 170 mental health experts. OpenAI says these clinicians observed that the latest version of ChatGPT “responds more appropriately and consistently than earlier versions.”\nIn recent months, several stories have shed light on how AI chatbots can adversely affect users struggling with mental health challenges. Researchers have previously found that AI chatbots can lead some users down delusional rabbit holes, largely by reinforcing dangerous beliefs through sycophantic behavior.\nAddressing mental health concerns in ChatGPT is quickly becoming an existential issue for OpenAI. The company is currently being sued by the parents of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT in the weeks leading up to his suicide. State attorneys general from California and Delaware — which could block the company’s planned restructuring — have also warned OpenAI that it needs to protect young people who use their products.\nEarlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed in a post on X that the company has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” in ChatGPT, though he did not provide specifics. The data shared on Monday appears to be evidence for that claim, though it raises broader issues about how widespread the problem is. Nevertheless, Altman said OpenAI would be relaxing some restrictions, even allowing adult users to start having erotic conversations with the AI chatbot.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the Monday announcement, OpenAI claims the recently updated version of GPT-5 responds with “desirable responses” to mental health issues roughly 65% more than the previous version. On an evaluation testing AI responses around suicidal conversations, OpenAI says its new GPT-5 model is 91% compliant with the company’s desired behaviors, compared to 77% for the previous GPT‑5 model.\nThe company also says its latest version of GPT-5 also holds up to OpenAI’s safeguards better in long conversations. OpenAI has previously flagged that its safeguards were less effective in long conversations.\nOn top of these efforts, OpenAI says it’s adding new evaluations to measure some of the most serious mental health challenges facing ChatGPT users. The company says its baseline safety testing for AI models will now include benchmarks for emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies.\nOpenAI has also recently rolled out more controls for parents of children who use ChatGPT. The company says it’s building an age prediction system to automatically detect children using ChatGPT, and impose a stricter set of safeguards.\nStill, it’s unclear how persistent the mental health challenges around ChatGPT will be. While GPT-5 seems to be an improvement over previous AI models in terms of safety, there still seems to be a slice of ChatGPT’s responses that OpenAI deems “undesirable.” OpenAI also still makes its older and less-safe AI models, including GPT-4o, available for millions of its paying subscribers.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HOME to 741-741 for free; text 988; or get 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line.

The new model is also better at rendering humans, the company said.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nImage 5 also enables layered and prompt-based editing — the model treats different objects as layers and allows you to edit them using prompts, or use tools like resize and rotate. The company said it makes sure that when you edit these layers, the image’s details and integrity are not compromised.\nAdobe’s Firefly site has supported third-party models from AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Runway, Topaz, and Flu to augment its appeal to its creative customer base, and now the company is taking that a step further by letting users  create custom models based on their art style. Currently in a closed beta, this feature lets users drag and drop assets, such as images, illustrations and sketches, to create a custom image model based on their style.\nThe company is also adding some new features to its Firefly website, which was redesigned earlier this year. The site now lets you use the prompt box to switch between generating images or videos, choose which AI model you want to work with, change aspect ratios, and more. The site’s home page now features your files and recent generation history, and you also get shortcuts to other Adobe apps (these were previously housed in a menu).\nAdobe has also redesigned the video generation and editing tool to support layers and timeline-based editing. This design change is currently only available in a private beta, and will be rolled out to users eventually.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nFirefly is also getting two new audio features: Users can now employ AI prompts to generate entire soundtracks and speech — using models from ElevenLabs — for videos. There’s also a new way to easily come up with prompts: just add keywords and sections by selecting words from a word cloud.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage credits: Adobe\nAs its competitors like Canva add AI to their platforms, Adobe is trying to cater to new-age creators who are increasingly using AI in their workflows. “We’re thinking of the target audience for Firefly as what we call creators or next-generation creative professionals. I think there are these emergent creatives that are GenAI-oriented. They love to use GenAI in all their workloads,” Alexandru Costin, the company’s VP of generative AI, told TechCrunch over a call.\nHe added that with Firefly, the company now has more freedom to add new features and play around with the interface as it doesn’t have to adhere to the muscle memory of creative professionals who might be used to certain workflows in Adobe’s existing Creative Cloud tools.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFitbit’s new Gemini-powered health coach, announced back in August, is becoming available as a public preview to Premium subscribers in the U.S. on Android starting tomorrow. It expands to iOS later this year. \nAs the AI race heats up, Google is counting on the Gemini AI assistant to help Fitbit stand out from the crowd. Called “Coach,” this feature is designed to be your all-in-one fitness trainer, sleep coach, and health and wellness advisor.\nImage Credits:Google\nAt the recent Made by Google event, Google showcased Coach’s various capabilities, like how it can create a custom routine based on your goals, preferences, and available equipment. \nFor example, if you want to run longer distances without becoming winded, Coach will create a tailored fitness plan with suggestions and achievable targets. While you work out, it’ll adjust your exercise plan in real time based on feedback to keep you on track. And if you happen to get injured later in the week, the AI will modify the plan accordingly.\nOther capabilities include analyzing your sleep habits and providing insights into how to improve your sleep quality over time.\nWhile the focus will be on Coach, the Fitbit app also features a makeover with a sleek design that’s easier to navigate, organized around four main tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle published a demo video on its Made by Google channel on YouTube that explains each tab. The Today tab, for instance, serves as the central hub of the app, highlighting key focus metrics, weekly cardio load data, and any other relevant statistics you may want to glance at quickly. You can manually customize which metrics you want to view at any time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Fitness tab, meanwhile, houses your workout plans and key metrics, such as your cardio goal and average weekly step count. However, keep in mind that several features are still unavailable, such as nutrition tracking and cycle logging.\nImage Credits:Google\nAdditionally, the Sleep tab allows you to track your sleep patterns, with a new feature that provides AI Coach insights to help you enhance your sleep quality. At the bottom of the tab, a Sleep summary aggregates all information from your last night’s sleep, such as whether you experienced prolonged periods of wakefulness during the night.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe Health tab is dedicated to key metrics, providing quick access to vital signs such as breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, and resting heart rate, offering a comprehensive overview of your health.\nTo check out the Coach preview on Android, you’ll need an active Fitbit Premium subscription and a compatible Fitbit smartwatch, tracker, or Pixel Watch.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nRobots can be programmed to do a variety of tasks, like packing boxes and even performing surgery. But each individual movement or task requires its own specific training process, which makes it hard for robots to adapt in real-world scenarios.\nMbodi wants to make training robots easier and quicker with the help of AI agents. The company will be showcasing this tech as one of the Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalists at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nNew York-based Mbodi built a cloud-to-edge system, a hybrid computing system using both cloud and local compute, that is designed to integrate into existing robotic tech stacks. The software relies on a multitude of AI agents that communicate with each other to gather the needed information to help a robot learn a task faster.\nOnce deployed, Mbodi will collect data and learn from its real-world use cases.\nXavier Chi, co-founder of Mbodi, told TechCrunch that users prompt the software using natural language, and Mbodi breaks down the request into smaller subtasks. Mbodi’s cluster of agents essentially divides and conquers the task to gather the needed information to train the robot on the prompt quickly.\n“The tricky thing with the physical world, it’s infinite possibility,” Chi said. “Every time you can invent something completely new, you haven’t had any data, that is a problem in the physical world. We always need to have a system where you can orchestrate different models or have anyone correct a robot and tell it to do certain things certain ways.”\nChi said he and co-founder Sebastian Peralta got the idea for the company while working as engineers at Google. While they weren’t working on robotics, they both came to the realization that the advancements in AI were heading to the physical world and despite a rise in physical AI, there still wasn’t a great way to quickly train robots.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany companies, like Skild AI and FieldAI, are looking to help make training robots faster by building large world AI models with enough real-world data to make it easier for them to adapt to new environments. Chi said that philosophy just doesn’t work with how much the world constantly changes.\nMbodi launched in 2024 with a focus on picking and packaging. The company won an ABB Robotics AI startup competition last year, which landed them a partnership with the Swiss robotics organization that was acquired by SoftBank for $5.4 billion in October.\nNow the company is working with a Fortune 100 company in the consumer and product goods space on a proof of concept.\n“For the CPG customer, they have a lot of people, they pack different products of their brand into a tray or a shelf thing, the problem is it changes every day,” Chi said. “Because of that, it is impossible to put robots there. To reprogram these robots, it’s just not possible, there is still a lot of humans doing that work.”\nMbodi hopes to start deploying its software more in 2026.\n“We want to build something that works, that can actually be deployed,” Chi said. “We aren’t a research lab; we don’t want to be a research lab in that regard. We want to put something in production that works reliably.”\nIf you want to hear from Mbodi firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect Chi’s title. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "description": "Strong by Form has designed a structural floor piece that can span longer distances than existing engineered wood, making it a replacement for steel or concrete. At the same time, the product is lighter than all three.",
    "body": "\nEven before a building accepts its first occupant, it has racked up a steep carbon debt. Worldwide, the materials and construction required to erect buildings contributes 11% of global carbon emissions, according to the World Green Building Council.\nSome places have begun experimenting with multistory timber buildings, and while they’ve recently reached new heights, timber buildings won’t be replacing skyscrapers anytime soon. But one Chilean startup thinks that there’s still room for wood to find a place.\n“We’re more into hybrid buildings,” Andrés Mitnik, co-founder and CEO of Strong by Form, told TechCrunch. His company has developed a new engineered wood product that can replace concrete and steel in structural floors, allowing architects to design lighter, less carbon intensive buildings. The company is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist and is presenting at TechCrunch Disrupt, which runs this week in San Francisco. \nThe secret is in how those floor plates are made. “We think we can shape wood in a way that no one else has done it before,” he said.\nStrong by Form has designed a structural floor piece that can span longer distances than existing engineered wood, making it a replacement for steel or concrete. At the same time, the product is lighter than all three.\nOn the outside, builders will see something familiar. “When a contractor gets it, they see a CLT [cross-laminated timber] slab,” Mitnik said. “All the connections, the construction system, all the processes on site are exactly as if you were using CLT, so no need to learn new things.”\nBut inside, instead of more solid wood, like you’d find in a CLT, the structure is filled with cavities. Wood shavings have been pressed into a wavy board that’s optimized to bear heavy loads.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe wavy panel looks like oriented strand board, or OSB, which is common throughout job sites. But Strong by Form has developed software and a manufacturing technique to tweak the size and alignment of the wood flakes that are held together by a glue-like binder. “It’s sort of a next-generation OSB, if you want to think about it like that,” Mitnik said.\nBy using wood’s natural form and strengths, Strong by Form has built wood structural floors that currently span 10 meters (about 33 feet). Most CLT floors can only span half that distance.\nAll that technology isn’t free, but Mitnik said that the higher costs of its engineered wood product can be offset by its lighter weight. \n“The idea is to create something that is so light it allows you to have an overall optimization of the structure,” he said. Lighter floors mean less steel and concrete in the frame, which lowers the overall cost of the building. “With those additional savings, we’re able to achieve price parity with concrete.”\nStrong by Form is testing its 10-meter panel, ensuring it meets fire and load ratings that structural engineers require.\nNext, it will raise a Series A round targeted at $10 million to build a pilot plant to produce the first pieces intended for commercial deployment.\nIn the meantime, Strong by Form has also developed a panel three millimeters thick that’s intended for finish instead of structural duty. The startup is working with train manufacturers to use its subtly undulating panel on the interior of trains, where they can soften the aesthetic of the walls and ceilings of train cars while reducing their mass.\n“That has allowed us to fund all the R&D [research and development] required to do the floors, which is what we really want to scale, because that’s where the impact is,” Mitnik said.\nIf you want to learn more about Strong by Form from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, this week in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nAstro Teller, CEO of X, Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” where the company incubates the nearly impossible, shared a look into what makes a moonshot and detailed the company’s “fail fast” mantra at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday.\nNotable companies that started out as moonshots from X’s moonshot factory include Waymo and Wing.\nTeller noted that X has a “2% hit rate,” which means that most of the things the company tries don’t work out, and that’s okay.\nHe said X defines a moonshot as having three specific components. The first is that it needs to attempt to solve a huge problem in the world. Second, there needs to be some kind of product or service that, however unlikely, would make the problem go away. Last, there has to be a sort of breakthrough technology that would provide a glimmer of hope at solving that huge, real-world problem.\n“If you worked at X, and you would just come up with a teleporter, you’ve got a moonshot story hypothesis, I would say, awesome, here’s a tiny amount of money, go see if you can prove that it’s wrong, because it probably is,” he said. “I don’t want you to make it work. I want you to get information about whether this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity or not, and it’s okay if the answer is no.”\nTeller went on to note that if someone is proposing a moonshot, and it sounds reasonable, the company isn’t interested, because that, by definition, wouldn’t be a moonshot. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea; that’s just not what X is looking for.\n“If you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components that I just described, and it’s a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,” Teller said. “If it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let’s put a bullet in its head and move on. And if it’s a little bit less crazy than we thought, awesome, here’s a tiny bit more money. Go try to find the next opportunity to kill it and repeat.”\nTeller emphasized that in order to do moonshots, you need to have equal amounts of audacity and humility.\n“If you don’t have really high audacity, you won’t start on these really unlikely journeys,” he said. “But, if you have anything less than really high humility, you’ll go luminously far down that unlikely journey.”\nX starts more than 100 things every year, and while 2% of them make it to exit five or six years later, 44% of all of the money that the company spends is on things that graduate and are “outrageously good,” Teller said. He says this is because X “kills all the bad ideas pretty early in the process.”\nTeller stated that people can learn innovation, noting that every single person was creative when they were children, but that we end up unlearning things that are useful, maybe even necessary for radical innovation. However, he says it’s possible to find these things again by creating an environment where you don’t feel stupid to go find them. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo’s co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, had a clear message during her interview on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 stage Monday: “It is imperative that we scale.”\nMawakana was speaking in the context of how Waymo balances fundraising (and burning through that money) with eventually achieving profitability. But she was also clear in the interview that she believes Waymo can increase road safety by reaching that scale. \nAll this helps explain why the company has been on an expansion tear this year and expects to launch in many more U.S. cities — D.C., Miami, Denver, Dallas, Seattle, and Nashville — as well as in London in 2026. It’s a furious pace that has seen the autonomous vehicle company leverage multiple partnerships with companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Avis.\n“By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,” she said.\nMawakana spent a lot of time during the interview with TechCrunch transportation editor Kirsten Korosec talking about the challenges of safely reaching that kind of scale.\nThe Waymo co-CEO maintained that the company is operating at a level that is safer than the typical human driver. And while she didn’t name names, she took a shot at competitors, saying they aren’t doing enough to prove that their autonomous vehicle technology is truly safe.\n“It is incumbent upon [them] to be transparent about what’s happening,” she said. “And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.”\nHer comments come as the company continues to iron out edge cases during its expansion — with one of the most recent incidents coming in Atlanta, Georgia, where a Waymo vehicle pulled out in front of a stopped school bus, leading to an investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nWaymo itself recently released a report claiming its vehicles are already five times safer than most human drivers, and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians.\nStill, Waymo vehicles have been caught making a number of head-scratching decisions. \n“It’s important to recognize, it’s not going to be perfection, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be accountable for transparency,” Mawakana said onstage. “I think … we really worry as a company about those days. You know, we don’t say whether, we say when, and we plan for them.”\nMawakana also said Waymo doesn’t think in terms of “how many [incidents] are allowable.”\n“We know they’re going to happen because our cars are on the road with humans, and unfortunately, right now, the state of the roads and the state of human driving is there is a lot of deaths, and there are a lot of injuries being caused on the roadways,” she said. \nAnd when asked whether the public would accept a death caused by a robotaxi in the face of the promise of greater safety, Mawakana said: “I think that society will.” \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nWaymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana believes other companies working on autonomous vehicles need to do more to prove their technology is safe, she said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nMawakana had just been asked who she considered to be on the list of companies trying to make roads safer during Monday’s interview.\n“I don’t know who’s on that list, because they’re not telling us what’s happening with their fleets,” she said. \nPrioritizing safety while scaling operations was a big topic during the interview, and Mawakana was sure to cite the data Waymo recently released that shows, by its count, that the company’s vehicles are five times safer than human drivers and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians.\nMawakana declined to say whether she was specifically talking about Tesla, but there are only a few companies in the U.S. right now claiming to be working on robotaxi tech. \nTesla publishes quarterly “vehicle safety reports.” But that data only focuses on the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance technology, which is designed to be used on highways, where the rate of crashes is lower than on surface streets. (And the latest report shows an uptick in crashes.) Tesla has not released any public data about the safety of its nascent robotaxi pilot program in Austin, Texas.\nOther companies in the space are early in the deployment phase or still testing their technology. Zoox has only just begun offering rides in its purpose-built AV in Las Vegas, Nevada. Companies like May Mobility and Pony AI are similarly starting up commercial operations. Aurora, the self-driving trucks company, has published a safety framework.\n“I think there is a responsibility, if you’re going to put vehicles on the road, and you’re going to remove the driver from behind the wheel, and you’re going to have someone in some other room observing the fleet who can take over their vehicles, it is incumbent upon you to be transparent about what’s happening,” she said. “And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.” \nCorrection: May Mobility has started offering commercial rides in the U.S. This story has been updated to reflect that.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

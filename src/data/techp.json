Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company reports Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S.\nThe issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. \nShopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage.\nThe exact number of affected merchants is unclear. However, Downdetector, a website that tracks user-submitted reports about website issues, noted there were about 4,000 outage incidents.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n"

    "body": "\nNvidia is investing $2 billion into Synopsys, which makes software and components for designing semiconductor chips. The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble.\nNvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia’s AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys’ electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release.\nThe deal gave Synopsys’ stock a lift by signaling long-term growth — a boon after the company recently reported weakness in its IP segment due to U.S. export restrictions and issues at a major customer.\nFor Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys’ widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions.\n"

According to The Wall Street Journal, workers moving into data-center construction are seeing pay jumps of 25% to 30% compared to their previous jobs — and in some cases, much more.\nAmong them is DeMond Chambliss, who traded his small drywall business in Columbus, Ohio, for a supervisor role overseeing 200 workers at a data center site. He now makes over $100,000 annually. “I pinch myself going to work every day,” the 51-year-old tells the Journal. In Oregon, electrical safety specialist Marc Benner pulls in $225,000 a year, while electrician Andrew Mason makes over $200,000 managing workers at six Northern Virginia data centers.\nThe Journal reports this isn’t just about higher base pay. Companies are sweetening the pot with perks like heated break tents, free lunches, daily incentive bonuses, and even remote project management positions. One construction site offers workers $100 in daily incentive pay, which can add up.\nThe surge comes as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to build hundreds of new data centers, colliding with an industry-wide shortage of roughly 439,000 skilled workers, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n8:58 AM PST · December 1, 2025\n\nImage Credits:Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nOpenAI is taking an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, whose parent company is one of the AI giant’s major investors, Thrive Capital. \nThrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services. \nNeither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but it will involve OpenAI sending employees from its engineering, research, and product teams to work within Thrive’s companies to accelerate AI adoption and boost efficiency. If those companies succeed, OpenAI’s stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to a source familiar with the matter. \nThe partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave. For instance, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy Nvidia chips. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. \nThe Thrive deal has a different structure, but the result is still interdependence. Here is how it will work. OpenAI embeds its own workers to build products and implement systems in Thrive’s portfolio companies. OpenAI profits when those companies scale based on growth its work helped generate.Thrive Holdings pushed back on the circular characterization. A spokesperson emphasized the deal is “responding to an unmet need in the market” rather than creating demand and pointed to organic customer interest from portfolio companies like accounting firm Crete, which has reportedly saved hundreds of hours of work with AI tools, and IT firm Shield that predated the formal partnership.\nBut for outside investors, the embedded nature of OpenAI’s involvement – and the overlapping ownership with Thrive Capital holding stakes on both sides – makes it difficult to assess whether success stems from genuine market traction or from advantages that may not scale without OpenAI’s direct support. \nAnalysts will be watching to see if Thrive-owned firms actually succeed in building long-term profitable businesses using OpenAI’s tech, or if the result is really just pumped-up valuations based on speculative market potential. \nThis article was updated to provide more detail into the nature of the deal.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

By releasing early, Deezer beats other streaming music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, in providing an annual summary of listeners’ favorite songs, artists, albums, and genres for 2025.\nThe feature, called “My Deezer Year,” offers users a detailed overview of their top tracks, top artists, favorite albums, and the amount of time spent listening to their most-played artist and their best track. \nThis year’s edition introduces a new “romantic comedy” theme for the recap’s visual presentation. According to Deezer, as users explore their listening habits, they’ll feel as if they’re starring in a romantic comedy, complete with scenes like a “meet cute.” Deezer narrates the story as users navigate through it, teasing plot twists along the way.\nImage Credits:Deezer\nThe experience is divided into three episodes. The first episode, titled “Meet Cute,” highlights the new artists users discovered throughout the year. The second episode, “Love Triangle,” features users’ top three artists, while the final episode, “Happily Ever After,” showcases their favorite tracks, along with a personalized playlist for continued listening. \nThis year’s experience differs from last year’s “My Deezer Year 2024,” which offered a different interactive approach, inviting users to choose between being “roasted” or “hyped up” based on their music preferences.\nSimilar to previous years, this year’s recap also includes a personalized quiz where users can answer compatibility questions based on their musical tastes and share results with friends to find their musical matches. \nImage Credits:Deezer\nAdditionally, users can create their own quizzes to share with others by entering their favorite genre, three songs, and a top artist, then see which friends match their preferences.

    "description": "From the time Brownlee launched Panels in September 2024, the app struggled to find an audience of its own. \"We knew it was niche … and ultimately, we weren't able to turn it into the vision I had,\" Marques Brownlee said.",
    "body": "\nTech YouTuber Marques Brownlee, or MKBHD, announced on Monday that his phone wallpaper app Panels is shutting down.\nFans had high hopes for Brownlee’s foray into app development, given his reputation as an eagle-eyed tech reviewer who has amassed more than 20 million followers on YouTube. He’s so influential that some blamed his commentary on Humane AI and Fisker for those companies’ eventual failures. (We think the real issue is that you shouldn’t raise $230 million if you have no product.) Yet from the time Brownlee launched Panels in September 2024, the app struggled to find an audience of its own.\n“We knew it was niche, but we made mistakes in making our first app, and ultimately, we weren’t able to turn it into the vision I had,” Brownlee said in an unlisted YouTube video. In a blog post, he added that “the makeup of the development team changed,” and he was unable to find the right collaborators to grow the app.\nBrownlee was inspired to create Panels because when he posts video reviews of phones, tablets, and computers, fans always point out how stunning his wallpapers and lock screens are. When he first announced the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd …” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.”\nPanels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog.\nThanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked No. 1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum.\nAccording to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, Panels reached about 900,000 lifetime downloads and $95,000 in consumer spending across iOS and Android. Last month, the app only received 3,000 downloads and $500 in consumer spending, dipping too low to rank on U.S. app stores.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPer Panels’ own disclosure, users downloaded more than 2 million wallpapers from the app.\nPanels will begin to refund users with active annual subscriptions when the app officially shuts down on December 31, 2025. However, Panels’ blog post outlines ways for customers to get their money back quicker. After the app shutdown, Panels says all user data will be deleted, and the app code will be open sourced so other developers can build on it, if they so desire.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nNvidia announced new infrastructure and AI models on Monday as it works to build the backbone technology for physical AI, including robots and autonomous vehicles that can perceive and interact with the real world.\nThe semiconductor giant announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research at the NeurIPS AI conference in San Diego, California. The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive.\nThis new model is based on Nvidia’s Cosmos-Reason model, a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August.\nTechnology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post.\nNvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do.\nThis new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\nAlongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese announcements come as the company is pushing full-speed into physical AI as a new avenue for its advanced AI GPUs. \nNvidia’s co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that the next wave of AI is physical AI. Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, echoed that sentiment in a conversation with TechCrunch over the summer, emphasizing physical AI in robotics.\n“I think eventually robots are going to be a huge player in the world and we want to basically be making the brains of all the robots,” Dally said at the time. “To do that, we need to start developing the key technologies.”\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nIf you want to bring a bit of holiday cheer to the screen you use the most, you’ll get a kick out of the newly updated Festivitas app for Apple devices. Originally designed to add holiday lights to your Mac’s desktop, this popular indie app has been updated this year with several new features, most notably a version of the app that brings its sparkling, colorful lights to iOS devices for the first time.\nWith the new Festivitas app for iPhone and iPad, you can add and customize a string of holiday lights on your device’s Home Screen using iOS widgets. The lights can frame your favorite personal photo (or perhaps a holiday image you dig up on Pinterest), and you can opt to make the widget transparent so it blends in with your background.\nImage Credits:Festivitas\nWhile seasonal apps can sometimes be low-quality cash grabs, developer Simon Støvring puts genuine effort and thoughtfulness into Festivitas’ design — and doesn’t charge an arm and a leg, either. Instead, the app is available for free to consumers, with premium features that can be unlocked for a fair price of between $3.99 and $9.99. (You get to choose the price that works best for you.)\nOn both macOS and iOS, you can customize the holiday lights in multiple ways, beyond picking their colors and flashing pattern. You can adjust the cable’s thickness, its drop width and height, and choose from pre-made color palettes like Candy Cane, Winter Snow, Elf, and others, or you can design your own.\nYou can also make finer adjustments to things like the colors’ hue or temperature, the speed of the flashes, and the spacing between the lights.\nImage Credits:Festivitas\nAnother perk is that you’ll be able to use the lights again outside of the winter holidays, as you can now change the bulb shape to designs like a bat, clover, Easter egg, heart, ghost, star, “2026,” and more throughout the year. This lets you continue to enjoy the app for other holidays and special events — there’s even a “WWDC” bulb for celebrating Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June.   \nAnother new feature this year is a snow effect for the Mac app, which adds floating snowflakes to your desktop. You can customize this experience, making the flakes gently drift down toward your dock, or increase the snow amount, fall speed, flake size, and wind, transforming it into what looks like a blizzard. You can also choose to have the snow fall on top of everything on the screen, or just on your desktop itself.\n\nBoth the snow and lights can react to your mouse as you move it across the screen, either repelling the snow or lifting and dropping the lights, for a bit of interactive fun. Plus, moving the lights up makes it easier to see your browser tabs when you need to click them, though you can turn this feature off if you prefer.\nIf you’re more technically inclined, you’ll appreciate the app’s Shortcuts integration that lets you automate when your lights and snow turn on. This lets you do things like trigger the snow based on the day’s forecast, or have the lights appear alongside your music, and more.\nImage Credits:Festivitas\nThere are plenty of other apps that offer holiday themes, widgets, and icons for your iPhone, but there’s a whimsy to Festivitas that makes it worth the download for anyone who’s into Home Screen or desktop personalization. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nA coalition of law enforcement agencies coordinated by Europol announced Monday the shuttering of cryptocurrency laundering service Cryptomixer.\nEuropol confirmed the seizure in a press release, where it called Cryptomixer “the platform of choice for cybercriminals seeking to launder illegal proceeds from a variety of criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.”\nSince 2016, Europol said, Cryptomixer facilitated the laundering of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in Bitcoin. \nHackers and other criminals use laundering services such as Cryptomixer to obfuscate and hide the provenance of their cryptocurrency. By design, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on public blockchains that allow law enforcement, as well as blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, to follow the money over time.\nAuthorities said they seized $25 million euros ($29 million) in Bitcoin, along with three servers, 12 terabytes of data, and the official domain cryptomixer.io, which now displays the customary law enforcement seizure splash page. \nAccording to Europol, the site “facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums and dark web markets,” and claimed its software “blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain.”\n“Deposited funds from various users were pooled for a long and randomised period before being redistributed to destination addresses, again at random times. As many digital currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions, mixing services make it difficult to trace specific coins, thus concealing the origin of cryptocurrency,” Europol said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCryptomixer offered customers anonymity, such as providing cover for cybercriminals who wanted to launder their crypto before taking the funds to legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges. Europol said the “cleaned” cryptocurrency could be swapped for other cryptocurrencies or fiat cash.\nOver the years, authorities have shut down or sanctioned several similar services, such as Tornado Cash, ChipMixer, and others.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nSouth Korean e-commerce platform Coupang over the weekend said nearly 34 million Korean customers’ personal information had been leaked in a data breach that had been ongoing for more than five months.\nThe company said it first detected the unauthorized exposure of 4,500 user accounts on November 18, but a subsequent investigation revealed that the breach had actually compromised about 33.7 million customer accounts in South Korea. \nThe breach affected customers’ names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, per Coupang. More sensitive data like payment information, credit card numbers, and login credentials was not compromised and remains secure, the company said.\nCoupang said it has reported the incident to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), and the National Police Agency.\nOne of South Korea’s biggest e-commerce platforms, Coupang also offers a quick-commerce service called “Rocket Delivery” in the country, and also operates its marketplace in Japan and Taiwan. A Coupang spokesperson told TechCrunch that the investigation has found no evidence that consumer data from Coupang Taiwan or Rocket Now was affected in the data breach.\n“According to the investigation so far, it is believed that unauthorized access to personal information began on June 24, 2025, via overseas servers,” the company said. “Coupang blocked the unauthorized access route, strengthened internal monitoring, and retained experts from a leading independent security firm.”\nPolice have reportedly identified at least one suspect, a former Chinese Coupang employee now abroad, after launching an investigation following a November 18 complaint.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis is the latest in a string of cybersecurity incidents in South Korea this year.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s AI chatbot, Rufus, saw a surge of adoption on Black Friday, according to new data published over the weekend by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. In the U.S., Amazon sessions that resulted in a purchase surged 100% on Black Friday compared with the trailing 30 days, while sessions that resulted in a purchase and didn’t include Rufus increased by only 20%.\nIn addition, Amazon saw a 75% day-over-day increase for sessions that included Rufus and resulted in a purchase, compared with just a 35% day-over-day increase for sessions without Rufus that had resulted in a purchase.\nThe firm also noted that Amazon sessions that involved the AI chatbot outpaced total website sessions. \nOn Black Friday, Amazon’s total website sessions increased by 20% day-over-day, while those that involved Rufus were up by 35%.\nAmazon’s AI chat was first launched into beta in early 2024 before rolling out to all U.S. customers later that year. Today, Rufus helps Amazon shoppers find products, get recommendations, and perform product comparisons.\nRufus’ adoption to drive Black Friday sales is part of a broader surge in consumers turning to AI to help them with holiday shopping, data shows.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nAccording to e-commerce data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday. This indicates that consumers more heavily embraced generative AI chatbots to find deals and research products this year. The AI tools were mostly used for popular Black Friday deal categories like electronics, video games, appliances, toys, personal care items, and baby and toddler products. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdobe Analytics also noted that the use of AI increased conversions. It found U.S. shoppers who came to a retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to buy, compared with non-AI traffic sources.\nWhether AI directly contributed to the record Black Friday spending of $11.8 billion is less clear. Instead, the sizable figure this year could be due to higher prices, not an increase in online shopping. As TechCrunch reported on Saturday, Salesforce data showed prices were up by an average of 7%, while order volumes were down by 1%.\nSensor Tower’s data similarly suggests that consumers were perhaps being more conservative in their spending this year, likely due to economic strains. Even though mobile app and website adoption spiked on Black Friday compared to the previous 30 days, gains in total visits and downloads decelerated from 2024, its data indicated. \nFor instance, Amazon’s and Walmart’s mobile app downloads grew by 24% and 20%, respectively on Black Friday, compared with the previous 30 days. But that growth paled when compared with 2024, when Amazon downloads surged by 50% and Walmart’s were up 75% during the same period, the firm pointed out.\nAmazon and Walmart’s website visits on Black Friday were up by 90% and 100% this year, respectively, compared with the prior 30 days. However, those same numbers in 2024 were 95% and 130%, respectively.\nIn a related Adobe survey, 48% of respondents said they have used or plan to use AI specifically for holiday shopping. \nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nA Google Search exec said that one of the company’s biggest opportunities in AI lies in its ability to get to know the user better and personalize its responses. \nThe promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service.\nIn a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses.\n“We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.”\nGoogle has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard. More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail, Calendar and Drive.\nBut as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history, and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. \nGoogle’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.\nThat, Stein said, would be “much more useful” than just showing users a more generic list of the best-selling products in a given category. “That is, I think, very much the vision — of building something that can be really knowledgeable for you, specifically.”\nThis idea isn’t all that different from how the “Others” in the hit Apple TV show “Pluribus” have gobbled up the world’s knowledge, including intimate details about individuals. When the system interacts with the show’s protagonist, Carol, it uses that data to personalize everything: cooking her favorite meals, adopting a familiar face to handle its communications with her, and otherwise anticipating her needs.\nBut Carol doesn’t find the personalized responses kind; she finds them invasive. She never consented to sharing her data with the hivemind, yet it knows her better than she’d like.\nSimilarly, it seems that avoiding Google’s data-gobbling ways will get increasingly difficult in the AI era, and if Google doesn’t get the balance right, the results could feel more creepy than useful.\n(To be clear: Google does let you control the apps Gemini uses to make its AI more knowledgeable about you specifically — it’s under “Connected Apps” in Gemini’s settings.)\nIf you do share app data with Gemini, Google says it will save and use that data according to the Gemini privacy policy. And that policy reminds users that human reviewers may read some of their data and not to “enter confidential information that you wouldn’t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve its services.”\nBut as more data gets ingested into Google’s own hivemind, it’s easy to see how AI could make data privacy more of a gray area.\nGoogle, however, believes it has a solution of sorts.\nStein says that Google will indicate when its AI responses are personalized.\n“I think people want to intuitively understand when they’re being personalized — when information is made for them, versus when [it’s] something that everyone would see if they were to ask this question,” he said.\nStein noted, too, that Google could send a push notification to users when a product they had been considering after several days of online research becomes available or is on sale.\n“There are all these ways that Google now, across modes, across kind of different aspects of your life, [is] being incredibly helpful to you…” he said. “And I think that’s more of how I think of the future of search than any one specific feature or single form factor.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nPlanned data center construction shows no signs of fading, with new additions to require 2.7x — nearly triple — the sector’s current demand for electricity over the next decade, according to a new report from BloombergNEF.\nBy 2035, data centers will draw 106 gigawatts, up sharply from the 40 gigawatts they use today. Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, BloombergNEF said.\nDriving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatt. \nPlanned data centers are significantly larger than those currently in operationImage Credits:BloombergNEF\nAt the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute.\nIn some ways, the findings in the new report aren’t surprising. AI companies have been racing to build more powerful data centers, helping to drive global investment in the facilities up to $580 billion this year. That’s more than the world spends finding new supplies of oil.\nStill, the new report shows just how quickly the landscape is changing. It is a sharp revision upwards from a document the group published in April. The upswing was driven by a surge in new projects that have been announced since then. “With an average seven-year timeline for projects to come online, developments in earlier stages affect the tail end of our forecast the most,” the new report said.\nEarly-stage projects have more than doubled between early 2024 and early 2025, though those are distinct from projects that have been committed or are currently under construction. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMuch of that new capacity is being planned for Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey. They lie within a region known to industry experts at the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization that’s tasked with operating the electrical grid in those states and others, including Delaware, West Virginia, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. Texas’s Ercot grid will see a large number of additions, too.\nThe report arrives as the PJM Interconnection is under scrutiny from its independent monitor, Monitoring Analytics. The group filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) saying that PJM has the authority to authorize new data center connections only when its grid has adequate capacity.\n“As part of its obligation to maintain reliability, PJM has the authority to require large new data center loads to wait to be added to the system until the loads can be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics wrote. “PJM has the authority to create a load queue.”\nWhat’s more, data centers are responsible for today’s high electricity prices within the region, the organization said. \n“PJM’s failure to clarify and enforce its existing rules and to protect reliable and affordable service in PJM is unjust and unreasonable,” it said. \nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration has agreed to inject up to $150 million into xLight, a semiconductor startup developing advanced chip-making technology, marking the third time the U.S. government has taken an equity position in a private startup and further expanding a controversial strategy that has put Washington on the cap tables of American companies.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the Commerce Department will provide the funding to xLight in exchange for an equity stake that will likely make the government the startup’s largest shareholder. The deal uses funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act and represents the first Chips Act award in President Trump’s second term, though it remains preliminary and subject to change.\nPrevious government equity investments under the Trump administration include publicly traded companies Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. Two rare earths startups also secured funding in exchange for equity from the Commerce Department last month.\nYou can imagine how this is all going over in Silicon Valley, where the libertarian ethos runs deep. At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha jokingly offered what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”\nOther VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings.\nThe four-year-old, Palo Alto, California, company at the center of this particular experiment is trying to do something genuinely audacious in semiconductor manufacturing. XLight wants to build particle accelerator-powered lasers — machines the size of a football field, mind you — that would create more powerful and precise light sources for making chips.\nIf it works, it could challenge the near-total dominance of ASML, the Dutch giant that has been publicly traded since 1995 and currently enjoys an absolute monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. (Its shares have surged 48.6% this year.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize.\n“I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s $40 million funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him.\nIndeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy.\nAs it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still nab a seat here.)\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality.\nAt least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

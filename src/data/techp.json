Deel on Thursday announced that it has raised a $300 million Series E round co-led by A-list fintech VC firm Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from existing investors like Coatue Management and General Catalyst.\nDeel says it’s been profitable for three years and surpassed $1 billion in ARR, including having a month — September — that hit $100 million in revenue. Deel’s business model focuses on serving global companies, handling the complexities of currency and employment regulation for far-flung international teams. It says it’s now grown to 35,000+ customers with more than 1.5 million workers in over 150 countries.\nThose are the types of numbers that attract investment, pending lawsuits or no. (Rippling’s California-filed lawsuit against Deel does not yet have a trial date, and is in the discovery phase, according to court records.) Indeed, Ribbit’s founder, Micky Malka, and a16z founder Ben Horowitz, gave Deel their full-throated supported in the announcement. In prepared statements, Malka said the Ribbit has been “fans” of the HR company for a long time, because it’s a “a brand companies trust,” and Horowitz said that a16z has been “blown away” by Deel’s work to build “the best HR platform” for global companies.\nFor what it’s worth, the lawsuits have not slowed down Rippling’s fundraising efforts either. In August, Rippling raised a $450 million Series G round at a $16.8 billion valuation.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

If the company attracts investors at the top of that range it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion.\nThe Vermont-based company, which was founded in 2017 by its enigmatic CEO Kyle Clark, filed the paperwork Wednesday despite the government shutdown. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that allows companies in IPO limbo to allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nClark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, has not followed the typical path of a startup founder. He eschewed Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and took a different path to raising funds to develop and build electric aircraft. Beta has never taken venture capital, instead raising $1.15 billion in funds from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority.\nLast month, Beta Technologies announced a strategic deal with GE Aerospace to build a hybrid-electric turbogenerator for next-gen aircraft. GE Aerospace agreed to take a stake in the company and invest $300 million as part of the deal.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

The scope of the change is “quite wide” and includes components and assembly for the company’s future notebooks and server products, Nikkei cited a supply chain source as saying. \nThe company is reportedly asking its existing partners to prepare manufacturing capabilities outside the country starting next year, and it is also pushing to move some production of its Xbox gaming consoles to other parts of Asia.\nAmazon Web Services, meanwhile, is considering buying fewer printed circuit boards for its AI data centers from its long-time supplier SYE, and has conducted an evaluation of what it could need to do. And Google is pushing its suppliers to ramp up server production in Thailand, where it has already secured multiple partners for parts, components, and assembly, the report said.\nHowever, moving production outside the country so quickly would prove difficult, given the vast range of components involved and their Chinese partners’ technological and manufacturing prowess, Nikkei noted.\nThe news follows a wave of retaliatory measures from both China and the U.S., who have taken turns to impose increasing tariffs on each other, tighten export controls on crucial components and resources, and restrict what tech can be sold.\nMicrosoft, Google, and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

    "body": "\nAmazon One Medical, the retailer’s primary care provider acquired in 2022, is launching a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for children ages 2 to 11, the company announced on Thursday. Message-based visits start at $29, and video visits cost $49.\nThe healthcare service doesn’t require insurance or a One Medical membership and can help treat issues like pink eye, lice, and more than 10 skin-related issues, including eczema, bug bites, contact dermatitis, fungal rashes, and more. The service also covers EpiPen and asthma medication renewals.\nAmazon started offering a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for adults in 2024.\n“This service isn’t meant to replace a family’s relationship with their child’s pediatrician, but rather to serve as a convenient option for those ‘in-between’ moments for parents with time-sensitive concerns who don’t already have on-demand access through a One Medical membership,” said Natasha Bhuyan, MD, family physician and national medical director for Amazon One Medical, in a press release. \nThe move comes as companies like Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart are scaling back their retail health services. \nAmazon last week debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics, starting in Los Angeles. The kiosks have a range of commonly prescribed medications, including antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure medications.\nThese new kiosks could disrupt brick-and-mortar pharmacy businesses, which are already struggling. For instance, Rite Aid recently closed all of its remaining stores; CVS has closed more than 1,000 stores since 2021; and Walgreens closed 500 stores over the past year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe launch of the new pay-per-visit service for kids marks Amazon’s latest move to expand its presence in the healthcare sector.

    "body": "\nBetween infinitely scrolling job boards and the puzzling rise of fake applicants using AI to apply en masse, job-searching has quickly become one of the most bewildering experiences the internet has to offer. Listings are posted and re-posted across different platforms as applications go unanswered, creating a spam-like flood of activity on both sides.\n“If you put a job on LinkedIn, you might get 1,000 people applying for that job within the first six hours,” says Matt Wilson, a London-based serial entrepreneur. “Some companies don’t even review the applicants that apply for those jobs, because the signal to noise ratio is very, very low.”\nWilson’s new solution is Jack & Jill, a new platform that uses conversational AI to reinvent the recruitment process from the ground up. The company announced $20 million in seed funding today, led by EU investor Creandum, but it’s hardly been in stealth. Service is already live in London, where the outfit has garnered nearly 50,000 users — and Wilson wants to use the influx of cash to fuel a US expansion and take Jack & Jill to a new level.\n“There hasn’t been a major change in how people find jobs since LinkedIn and Indeed came on the scene 20 years ago,” says Wilson. His bet is that, with AI chatbots changing workplaces across the world, now might be the time to shake things up.\nAs you might guess from the name, Jack & Jill is a two-part platform. The “Jack” side of the platform handles the applicant side, giving users a 20-minute, AI-powered profile interview before providing them with a select list of roles pulled from online databases. From there, Jack can be used for mock interviews or more involved professional coaching. “Jill” works with employers, building a profile of a particular role and elevating candidates that match its requirements. Like LinkedIn, part of the goal is for both workers and hiring managers to keep an active presence on their respective apps, letting the app pull players off the sidelines as needed. The service takes a standard commission from any successful hire, and as the scope of the platform grows, Wilson hopes to make Jack & Jill indispensable for both sides.\nThat might sound like a standard recruiting system with a little AI sprinkled on top, but Wilson thinks conversational chatbots are more important than a simple matching algorithm. By building the process around chatbot interviews, he believes he’s found a scalable alternative to the endless shuffle of listings and resumes, potentially reinventing the basic elements of the contemporary hiring process.\nUsing AI systems to conduct first-round interviews is increasingly common in many parts of the world — particularly in China, where many multinational corporations have used the practice for hiring local roles. But while a surprise interview with an AI hiring manager might seem alienating, Wilson hopes that Jack & Jill’s approach will result in more intelligence applied to job placement overall.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I think the way that we are mapped to the companies we work for, and vice versa, is just extremely inefficient,” Wilson says. “There are billions of people out there that could be in better jobs for them. And that’s a mission worth working on.”\nAn earlier version of this piece was published with an erroneous figure in the headline. TechCrunch regrets the error.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nSpotify has been spotted developing a “SongDNA” feature that would allow users to discover music through the credits — the writers, collaborators, vocalists, engineers, lyricists, producers, composers, and others who worked on a given track or album.\nThe feature was discovered in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who was able to generate screenshots of how SongDNA would appear in the app. Based on her findings, SongDNA would introduce a visual experience where you could essentially navigate through the credits, see how people were connected to each other, and explore their various works.\n\nFor instance, Wong showed how one artist, Rei Ami from the “KPop Demon Hunters” cast, had lent her voice to other tracks beyond those from the movie.\nIf Spotify releases the feature to the public, it could challenge the streaming service TIDAL’s interactive credits, which also lets you explore music through the contributors behind the songs you love. The addition could be useful for music industry pros looking for collaborators, as well as anyone wanting to learn more about the people who work behind the scenes in music creation.\nShortly after posting screenshots to social media, Wong said Spotify’s app was updated to remove references to the SongDNA feature. Reached for comment, Spotify declined to share further details but did not issue a denial.\nFollowing Wong’s post, another reverse engineer and technologist, Chris Messina, was able to confirm SongDNA’s existence by finding references to the feature within the app’s code. According to Messina, the lines of code suggest the feature could be used to reveal the network of contributors behind songs, allowing users to explore more of their work, he said.\nImage Credits:Chris Messina via Threads (opens in a new window)\nWhile some wondered if SongDNA would be Spotify’s answer to Pandora’s Music Genome Project, it appears that’s not quite the case. The Genome Project uses hundreds of different details, or “traits,” corresponding to a particular characteristic of the music to classify tracks and determine how they’re related.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSongDNA, for now at least, appears to be more focused on just the people behind the music, not the music itself. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

In partnership with Sony, Universal, Warner, and Merlin, the streamer said it would develop “responsible AI” products that respect copyright, but also allow the artists to choose whether or not they want to allow the use of AI tools.\nSpotify didn’t delve into the specifics of how the new tools would operate, but the company already offers generative AI experiences for users, including with its AI DJ that plays a personalized selection of songs and others that allow users to request playlists using AI prompts, for instance. \nSpotify was recently criticized for allowing an AI-generated band’s music to go viral on its service, raising questions about whether the future of music would push human artistry to the side.\nLast month, the company revamped its AI policy to cut down on spam, particularly users who upload AI content at mass scale, create duplicates, and manipulate the search and recommendations systems. Spotify also said it would adopt the music labeling system DDEX to label when AI was used as part of the music creation process.\nThe upcoming gen AI features follow that promise by allowing artists to opt in to using AI tools if they choose. In all likelihood, the upcoming system would allow artists to identify when their music is used in AI-generated tracks and collect some sort of payment. Spotify notes the system will expand beyond artists to include other rightsholders and distributors over time.\n“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential,” Spotify shared in its announcementment. “If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development,” it read.\nIn addition, Spotify said it has begun building a generative AI research lab and product team focused on building out new technologies that reflect its principles that artists should be able to choose if and how they participate in the AI music ecosystem. It says work on the first products has already started, and more tools will be on the way. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nApple announced Tuesday that it had signed contracts for 650 megawatts of renewable power in Europe.\nThis includes wind and solar projects that are either operational or will be soon. A large chunk of the power they’ll produce will go toward offsetting the energy used by Apple customers. Use of everything from Mac Pros to Apple Watches accounts for nearly one-third of the company’s carbon footprint.\nEven though Europe isn’t usually considered a sunny continent, Apple is buying energy from several solar farms, including 110 megawatts each in Greece and Latvia, 131 megawatts in Spain, and 40 megawatts in Poland. Wind farms will contribute 99 megawatts in Romania and a portion of the 129 megawatt solar-wind portfolio in Italy.\nSeparately, Apple also said it would invest $150 million in China to help its suppliers switch to renewable energy. Already, renewable sources power more than 90% of the company’s manufacturing and production in the country.\nPerhaps most notable about these announcements is that they appear in the newsrooms of Apple’s regional websites, but not in the feed of its U.S. press site. Previously, the company’s press releases on regional renewable power purchases have appeared in that feed, perhaps out of a desire to not draw the ire of the Trump administration, which has been antagonistic to renewables.\nStill, solar and wind — and increasingly grid-scale batteries — have been the go-to source of energy for tech companies looking to power their operations.\nMicrosoft and Meta have also been consistent buyers of solar in particular. This year alone, Meta has added over 2 gigawatts of solar capacity, and Microsoft has signed deals that raise its total by 1.5 gigawatts.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile most big tech firms have pledged to move to renewable power, more practical considerations help drive such deals. Solar and wind are among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, undercutting coal and natural gas. When paired with batteries, which continue to drop in cost, they can provide firm, 24/7 power.\nThe other reason is speed: Solar farms can be built quickly, with a typical project requiring just 18 months to complete. What’s more, they can be completed in phases, allowing part of the project to come online early. For tech companies, which are in a race to secure power for their data centers and AI operations, that speed can make a significant difference. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFollowing backlash over an increase in “AI slop” taking over users’ feeds, Pinterest on Thursday added new tools that let users limit how much AI-generated content they see on the platform.\nUsers can now personalize their feeds to restrict GenAI imagery in select categories, and the company said it will make its existing GenAI content labels more noticeable in the days to come.\nThe site, widely used to browse and bookmark aspirational content and potential purchases, has come under fire from users who have complained about the massive uptick in GenAI content. The media has also been documenting the problem, while openly wondering if AI has already ruined Pinterest or if it could still be fixed.\nThe problem, if left unresolved, could destroy Pinterest’s reputation, and ultimately, its bottom line.\nAI slop is also potentially a tough nut to crack as more of the web fills up with AI-generated content and the quality of the AI content improves, making it less obvious to spot. Citing academic literature, Pinterest notes that GenAI content now makes up 57% of all online material.\nTo address the issue, Pinterest earlier this year introduced “AI modified” labels that would appear on images whose metadata indicated AI generation, or if Pinterest’s own systems detected that the content was AI-generated. At the time, the company said it would “soon” introduce consumer-facing tools that would let users choose to see less AI content.\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nThose tools have now arrived and will be available in the app’s “Settings” menu, under “Refine your recommendations.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHere, users will be able to configure whether they’d like to see less GenAI content in certain categories that are prone to AI-generated imagery, like beauty, art, fashion, and home décor. Pinterest said it will introduce more categories in the future, based on user feedback. Plus, if users want to modify their settings, they can do so at any time.\nIn addition, users can send feedback about AI imagery as they browse the site. If they see a Pin that’s not appealing because of its generative AI nature, they can tap the three-dot overflow menu and select a category to refine their preferences. \nThe new controls are launching first on the website and Android, and will roll out to iOS users over the weeks ahead, Pinterest said.\n“Our community is at the heart of everything we do,” said Matt Madrigal, Pinterest’s Chief Technology Officer, in a statement about the launch. “With our new GenAI controls, we’re empowering people to personalize their Pinterest experience more than ever—striking the right balance between human creativity and AI innovation, and ensuring every feed truly reflects what inspires them most.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The Shopify-native platform helps brands boost retention through customizable loyalty, referrals, and account management tools.",
    "body": "\nAndrew Lissimore has been running the audio apparel site Headphones.com for nearly a decade now. While audiophiles have a high affinity towards their gear and want to try out new gadgets, Lissimore wasn’t satisfied with continuously spending money on platforms like Meta and Google to acquire new customers; he wanted to find a way to better retain the customers he already had.\nThe founder started to look for solutions within the Shopify ecosystem that would help the business with loyalty programs. But most of what he found offered only spend and tier-based solutions. So he decided to build his own system. \nWhat started as a project to solve loyalty for Headphones.com is now a startup called Lantern, which other companies can use to easily integrate loyalty solutions into their own businesses.\nInitially, the company wired together different apps to have a variety of loyalty points based on stamps, spend, points, and referrals, but it was hard to manage. Plus, bringing together different apps introduced challenges with user experience flows and brand identity.\n“We thought it would be great to have a Shopify native system for loyalty that is easy to customize and integrate,” Lissimore said. “I managed to convince Shopify designers Kyle Peatt and Dominic McPhee, who built their Polaris design system, to work on this.” \nLater, both joined Lantern as co-founders. Peatt currently works as the chief design and product officer, and McPhee works as the chief technology officer. In total, the company currently has eight full-time employees.\nLantern co-founders Dominic McPhee and Kyle Peatt. Image Credits: Lantern\nLantern can handle customer account creation and management, loyalty, and referrals for any vendor working on Shopify. Websites can reward returning or new customers, and award them points for activities like participating in forums, as well. The company explained that the sellers can easily integrate their solution and don’t need to add any extra code to do so.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLissimore said that operating Headphones.com provided the perfect testing ground for Lantern to understand the pain points of being a seller and getting better retention.\n“I think we were in the perfect spot to come up with something like Lantern because we [headphones.com] were so desperate to increase the repurchase rate. A lot of businesses like clothing brands or makeup brands have naturally built in repurchase, but for us, it was existential,” he told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits: Lantern\nAfter Headphones.com adopted Lantern, its purchase rate for repeat visitors increased from 30% to 50%. The period for buying a second pair of headphones has also reduced from 198 days to 98 days. \nThe company now has clients like skincare site Counter, which rakes in over $200 million a year, and footwear brand Vessi. It has also built tools to measure retention effectively to show Lantern’s value to its clients.\nTo further grow its business, Lantern raised $3.1 million in seed funding led by Salesforce Ventures, with participation from Sidekick Partners, Day One Ventures, and individual investors like Vessi’s Tony Yi. The company directly competes with existing startups such as LoyaltyLion and Yotpo.\nRob Keith, a partner at Salesforce Ventures, said that Lantern stood out to the firm because the startup is approaching retention through means that go beyond point-based loyalty with a flexible approach.\n“Lantern brings together something unique—Andrew built and scaled Headphones.com and lived these retention challenges as a merchant, while Kyle and Dominic come from Shopify, where they built the Polaris design system that thousands of developers use today. That combination means they understand both what merchants actually need and how to build solutions that feel native to the platform rather than bolted on,” he said.\nKieth added that Lantern’s features, like wallet functionality, directly appearing in checkout without any pop-ups or redirects, help both consumers and brands.\nIn its product roadmap, the company plans to leverage AI and provide customers with insights and recommendations around retention.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Today, the company spun out a frontier research lab that's using that data to build AI agents that understand how they move through space and time, a concept called spatial-temporal reasoning.",
    "body": "\nMedal, a platform for uploading and sharing video game clips, has spun out a new frontier AI research lab that’s using its trove of gaming videos to train and build foundation models and AI agents that can understand how objects and entities move through space and time – a concept known as spatial-temporal reasoning.\nCalled General Intuition, the startup is betting that Medal’s dataset – which consists of 2 billion videos per year from 10 million monthly active users across tens of thousands of games – surpasses alternatives like Twitch or YouTube for training agents. \n“When you play video games, you essentially transfer your perception, usually through a first-person view of the camera, to different environments,” Pim de Witte, CEO of Medal and General Intuition, told TechCrunch.  He noted that gamers who upload clips tend to post very negative or positive examples, which serve as really useful edge cases for training. “You get this selection bias towards precisely the kind of data you actually want to use for training work.” \nThis data moat is what reportedly attracted the attention of OpenAI, which late last year attempted to acquire Medal for $500 million, per The Information. (Neither OpenAI nor General Intuition would comment on the report.) \nIt’s also what has led to General Intuition’s raising a whopping $133.7 million in seed funding, led by Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst with participation from Raine. \nGeneral Intuition’s founding team.,Image Credits:General Intuition\nThe startup intends to use the funds to grow its team of researchers and engineers focused on training a general agent that can interact with the world around it, aiming for initial applications in gaming, and search and rescue drones.  \nDe Witte says the founding team has already made strides: General Intuition’s model can understand environments it wasn’t trained on and correctly predict actions within them. It’s able to do this purely through visual input; agents only see what a human player would see, and they move through space by following controller inputs. This approach, the company says, can transfer naturally to physical systems like robotic arms, drones, and autonomous vehicles, which are often manipulated by humans using video game controllers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGeneral Intuition’s next milestone is two-fold: generating new simulated worlds for training other agents, and autonomously navigating entirely unfamiliar physical environments.  \nThat technical approach is shaping how the company plans to commercialize its technology, and sets it apart from competitors building world models.  \nWhile General Intuition is also building world models on which to train its agents, such  models aren’t the product. Unlike other world model makers like DeepMind and World Labs, which are selling their world models Genie and Marble for training agents and content creation, General Intuition is focusing on other use cases to avoid copyright issues.  \n“Our goal is not to produce models that compete with game developers,” de Witte said.  \nInstead, the startup’s gaming applications center around creating bots and non-player characters that can surpass traditional “deterministic bots,” or preprogrammed characters that produce the same output every time. \n“[The bots] can scale to any level of difficulty,” Moritz Baier-Lentz, a founding member of General Intuition and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, told TechCrunch. “It’s not compelling to create a god bot that beats everyone, but if you can scale gradually and fill in liquidity for any player situation so that their win rate is always around 50%, that will maximize their engagement and retention.” \nDe Witte also has a background in humanitarian work, which informs the startup’s focus on powering search and rescue drones, that sometimes have to navigate unfamiliar environments and extract information without GPS. \nUltimately, de Witte and Baier-Lentz see General Intuition’s core functionality – spatial-temporal reasoning — as a crucial piece in the race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). While major AI labs focus on building ever more powerful large language models, General Intuition believes true AGI requires something LLMs fundamentally lack.  \n“As humans, we create text to describe what’s going on in our world, but in doing so, you lose a lot of information,” de Witte said. “You lose general intuition around spatial-temporal reasoning.”\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nIt’s been almost a decade since Omar Darwazah and Kyle Hendrick launched AAF Management and its first fund of $25 million in 2017. \nRather than racing to dramatically increase their assets under management like many funds have in recent years, the partners have intentionally kept their fund sizes small, even as their reputation and returns have grown. \nTheir latest vehicle — a $55 million early-stage hybrid fund, dubbed the Axis Fund, that recently closed — brings the Washington-based venture firm’s total assets to roughly $250 million across four funds. The firm raised a $39 million Fund II in 2021 and a $32 million fund-of-funds investment vehicle in 2017 for a select group of its limited partners.\n“Running a $50 million fund is very different from running a $500 million fund,” general partner Darwazah said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We’ve seen that naturally large fund sizes can disrupt GP-LP alignment as it becomes a function of management-fee generation versus carried-interest generation, and that’s not a game we want to play.”\nUnlike typical VC firms that invest directly into startups, AAF is adopting elements of a fund-of-funds model where it invests part of its capital into a portfolio of emerging funds in addition to backing startups. \nWith this fourth fund, AAF plans to invest in emerging managers’ first or second funds (typically under $50 million) and their most promising portfolio companies from pre-seed to pre-IPO, the partners said.\nThe firm is allocating about 80% of its capital to startups and 20% to emerging funds, blending the two into what it calls a “one-stop capital-formation partner” for founders and fund managers alike.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo far, the Axis Fund has backed 25 pre-seed and seed-stage venture funds, along with five direct bets on early-stage and growth startups.\n“We’ve found that the richest dataset of private-market companies at the earliest stages of their formation over the past decade is accessed only through LP checks in emerging managers,” said Hendrick, the firm’s other general partner.\nThis dual fund type strategy has granted AAF access to many promising startups. The firm is an early investor in Current, Drata, Flutterwave, Jasper, and Hello Heart.\nSimilarly, through the funds where it’s an LP, AAF holds indirect exposure to other unicorns, including Mercury, Deel, Retool, and more recently AI firms such as Motion, Decagon and Eleven Labs through its network of seed-fund LP positions in firms like Leonis Capital, Wayfinder Ventures, and Quiet Capital (the firm founded by Lee Linden, who is exploring a similar two-pronged strategy with former Founders Fund GP Brian Singerman for a new fund).\nThe eight-year-old venture firm claims to have exposure to roughly 800 venture-backed companies launched between 2021 and 2025 through these underlying managers. \nL-R: Kyle Hendrick and Omar Darwazah [general partners and managing directors]Image Credits:AAF Management\nWith this approach, AAF also focuses less on hands-on help with hiring or product for portfolio companies and more on connecting founders with later-stage capital from its network of limited partners. That’s a service that becomes especially helpful once a startup begins raising growth rounds.\n“I’d say where we typically add the most value to a founder’s journey, especially in the early phase, is through our venture network,” said Hendrick. “That means we can inject you directly into 45 active venture funds where we’re LPs. It’s instant distribution into their ecosystems.”\nAt the same time, AAF serves as a conduit between institutional investors — especially in the Gulf — who often prefer diversified venture exposure without managing dozens of direct relationships.\nAbu Dhabi’s Mubadala, several U.S., European, and MENA family offices, GPs from leading U.S. asset managers, a multi-billion-dollar U.S. venture firm, and a publicly traded company are backing this fourth fund, the firm said.\nDarwazah and Hendrick came to venture from different backgrounds. Darwazah, who previously worked in corporate finance and private equity in the Middle East, has spent years bridging Gulf capital with U.S. startups. Hendrick, a former entrepreneur who also worked at the UAE Embassy in the U.S. and at a family office in Abu Dhabi, brings an operator’s lens to AAF’s earliest deals.\nAcross its four funds, AAF has made 138 direct investments and backed 39 unique emerging managers, with 20 portfolio exits totaling nearly $2 billion in aggregate value. \nThose exits include TruOptik, MoneyLion, Even Financial, Portfolium, Prodigy, BetterView, Lightyear, Trim, HeyDoctor, and Medumo. At least six publicly traded companies have acquired its portfolio companies including TransUnion, Giant Digital, GoodRx, and Affirm.\nThe firm says this all adds up to some of its previous fund vintages ranking in the top decile in terms of net TVPI for their respective vintages, according to Cambridge Associates and Carta data.\n“Our strategy allows us to identify signal from noise and increase our probability of backing outliers — fund returners, 10x cash-on-cash companies, and seed-to-unicorn investments,” said Darwazah.\n"

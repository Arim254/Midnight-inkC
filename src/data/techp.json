    "body": "\nGrok, the chatbot built by Elon Musk’s xAI and popularized on his social media platform X, appears to have repeatedly spread misinformation about today’s mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Australia.\nGizmodo pointed to a number of posts where Grok misidentified the bystander — 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed — who disarmed one of the gunmen, and where it questioned the authenticity of videos and photos capturing al Ahmed’s actions.\nIn one post, the chatbot misidentified the man in a photo as an Israeli hostage, and in another post brought up irrelevant information about the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians. In another post, it claimed a “43-year-old IT professional and senior solutions architect” named Edward Crabtree was the one who actually disarmed a gunman.\nGrok does appear to be fixing some of its mistakes. At least one post that reportedly claimed a video of the shooting actually showed Cyclone Alfred has been corrected “upon reevaluation.”\nAnd the chatbot subsequently acknowledged al Ahmed’s identity, writing that the “misunderstanding arises from viral posts that mistakenly identified him as Edward Crabtree, possibly due to a reporting error or a joke referencing a fictional character.” (The article in question appeared on a largely non-functional news site that may be AI-generated.)\n"

But the Department of Commerce last week gave Nvidia the nod to sell H200 GPUs in China, in exchange for a 25% cut of sales of those chips. \nNvidia is now seeing such strong demand from Chinese companies that it is considering adding more capacity, Reuters reported. However, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow the import of the H200 chips, which are said to be significantly more powerful than the H20 GPUs Nvidia had customized to sell in China.\nFor the chipmaker, expanding production of the H200 GPUs would let it tap latent demand in a country that is racing to develop its own homegrown AI chips. Competition and national security concerns in the West have hampered the availability of the latest and most powerful hardware for training AI models in China, where companies have resorted to focusing on efficiency over sheer scale.\nChinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, which are developing their own AI models, have already been in touch with Nvidia to figure out large orders for the H200 chips, which are being produced in limited quantities, the report added.\n“We are managing our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

    "body": "\nJust about six months after Tesla started testing its fledgling Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, the company is now letting those cars drive around the city with no safety monitor onboard.\nThe removal of the human safety monitors brings the company a critical step closer to its goal of launching a real commercial Robotaxi service, and it’s a step that’s been years in the making. \nCEO Elon Musk spent a nearly decade promising Tesla’s cars were just a software update away from being fully driverless. Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”\nThe removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla’s ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla’s small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company aggressively redacts its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nVideo of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was testing “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company’s own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla’s head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, wrote: “And so it begins!”\nTesla started offering rides in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the driver’s seat in September. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans’ counts.\nMusk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he believed this fleet would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or around 60 vehicles.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company’s advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.\nMusk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company’s Robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla’s website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk’s own admission in January, will need to be upgraded.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAI lets anyone create videos, but many AI video creation tools lack support for audio. Mirelo is building AI that adds soundtracks to match the video’s action. \nEarlier this year, the Berlin-based startup released Mirelo SFX v1.5, an AI model that interprets videos to add synced sound effects (SFX). \nThis attracted attention from VCs gearing up for a generative AI revolution in games. The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\nThis new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and ElevenLabs, which is also backed by a16z.\nWhile Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch.\nThese new hires will support Mirelo’s R&D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on Fal.ai and Replicate, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use.\nAs Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index’s investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists’ rights. \nIt’s a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn’t displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos.\nAccording to Simon-Gabriel, creators can’t fully benefit from this new potential without audio. \n“George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It’s not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it’s an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”\nHe and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. \n“It’s easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted.\nThis could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo’s total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap.\nThe startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others.\nStill, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. \nFor instance, Gemini’s video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind’s Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.’ But, of course, you should add some. It’s a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSnapchat announced on Monday that its end-of-year Recaps are rolling out to users, giving them a look back at 2025. The Recap is a short video that offers a personalized look at highlights from Snaps, Stories, and Chats, showing how users connected and expressed themselves throughout the year.\nUsers can access their Recap by opening up the app and navigating to the “Memories” section. There, they will see a “Your 2025 Snap Recap” card. \nThe move comes as companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Duolingo have all released their own end-of-year recaps.\nAlongside the Recaps, Snapchat shared statistics on how people used the social media app over the past year. For example, the company says phone calls aren’t dead, noting that users talked for nearly 1.7 billion minutes per day on average, almost 30% more than last year. Plus, users in the U.S. sent over five billion voice notes, nearly 10% more than last year.\nGroup chats still remain a popular way to connect on Snapchat, as the number of people sending messages to group chats grew by more than 5% in 2025, and some users sent more than 8,880 messages to their top group chat this year.\nThe company also revealed that Chat Reactions grew by 44% this year, with the heart emoji taking the crown as the most popular. Additionally, three million more people also used stickers to communicate this year.\nThe launch of Snap’s 2025 Recap arrives amid user backlash over the company’s plans to charge for storage next year, with some calling for a boycott to urge the company to change its mind. Snapchat announced in September that free access to Memories will be limited to 5GB. If a user’s memories exceed this limit, they’ll need to subscribe to one of the service’s new Memories Storage plans.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month.

    "body": "\nIn a world that’s rapidly filling up with AI-generated content, a startup called First Voyage wants to help people avoid all the AI slop blasted their way and instead build the habits they want. And it’s doing that by way of an AI companion app: Called Momo Self Care, the app offers a digital pet called Momo that you can take care of, and in return, it’ll remind you to complete habit-building tasks.\nUsers can set up reminders for what tasks they want to complete, and Momo will remind you of them. Similar to the hit productivity app Focus Friend, Momo also rewards you with coins for completing tasks that can be used to purchase items within the app to further customize the pet. Users can also talk to Momo about self-care, and the AI companion will recommend habits and tasks based on what you want to achieve.\n“Momo helps users become the best versions of themselves, and users reward Momo with care, affection, and cute accessories,” co-founder and CEO Besart Çopa told TechCrunch.\nOn Monday, First Voyage said it had raised $2.5 million in a seed funding round from a16z speedrun, SignalFire, True Global, and other investors.\n\nCopa said Momo users have already created more than 2 million tasks on the platform, and the most popular habits relate to productivity, spirituality and mindfulness.\nBut with the wave of AI apps and toys hitting the market, not to mention the burgeoning influence of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude and Grok, there’s increasing concern that these new, so-called “companions” can lead to more harm than good. \nÇopa, for one, believes that relationships between AI characters and humans will only increase in the next few years.

The First Voyage team also hopes to make Momo more intelligent in how it interacts with people.  \n“We hope Momo and the community around it become a defining consumer brand that uses the best of AI, animation, and gamification to improve as many lives as possible,” Çopa said.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

A new investor is participating in the remaining portion of the primary, but TechCrunch could not confirm its specifics.\nWestBridge Capital is doubling down in the new round with a check of a similar size to its previous investment, the people said. The firm invested about $35 million to $40 million in Spinny’s Series F round earlier this year.\nMuch of the secondary portion of the transaction is being sold by Indian VC firm Fundamentum, according to the people, while Blume Ventures is also expected to pare part of its stake.\nAccel, Fundamentum, and Blume Ventures did not respond to requests for comments. WestBridge Capital declined to comment.\nIn March, Spinny raised $131 million in the first part of its Series F round led by Accel, with participation from Fundamentum, before expanding the raise to about $170 million in June to include WestBridge Capital. Those funds were earmarked to scale Spinny’s core used-car business. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, the new round is being raised specifically to finance the acquisition of GoMechanic and invest in its platform, without drawing on the startup’s existing cash reserves, the people said. Earlier reports suggested Spinny could buy GoMechanic for around ₹4.5 billion (approximately $49.70 million) in a cash-and-stock deal.\nA consortium led by Lifelong Group acquired GoMechanic in 2023 after the startup admitted to “grave errors” in its financial reporting. The startup had previously been backed by high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and SoftBank.\nFor Spinny, acquiring GoMechanic would deepen its control across the used-car value chain. The Gurugram-based startup has built a large consumer-facing business, selling about 13,000 used cars a month, primarily directly to buyers and, to a lesser extent, to dealers through its auction platform. Spinny operates its own large reconditioning centers to refurbish vehicles before sale and relies on third-party service shops for after-sales servicing of customer cars — a gap GoMechanic could bring in-house.\nGoMechanic would also act as a “two-way” funnel for Spinny, a person familiar with the matter said. The platform would service vehicles bought or sold through Spinny, and help attract car owners who may not yet be customers. That could help expand Spinny’s vehicle supply without significantly increasing customer acquisition costs.\nThe acquisition comes as India’s used-car market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% to roughly 9.5 million units by 2030, from nearly 6 million units today, per a recent report by Mahindra First Choice and Volkswagen Pre-owned Certified. \nThe GoMechanic deal would mark Spinny’s latest move to broaden its footprint in India’s automotive market. In recent months, the startup has expanded beyond used-car sales by acquiring auto publications Autocar India, Autocar Professional and What Car? India from London-based media group Haymarket, and by launching a non-banking finance company, Spinny Capital, to offer vehicle loans to customers.\nSpinny co-founder and CEO Niraj Singh declined to comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

According to the sheriff’s department, the footage shows that after dropping off the food and taking a photo, the woman appeared to spray a substance towards the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain.\nThe sheriff’s department said that using DoorDash records, detectives identified the woman as Kourtney Stevenson of Kentucky, who told local police in a phone call that she had been working for DoorDash while visiting her father, and that she’d used pepper spray to spray a spider. But the department also said that with an overnight low of 35 degrees Fahrenheit, “outdoor spiders in Indiana are not active and would not be capable of crawling on exposed surfaces.”\nWhen Stevenson allegedly declined to come in for an interview, detectives obtained a warrant to arrest her for battery resulting in a moderate injury and consumer product tampering. She is now awaiting extradition to Indiana.\nA DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement that Stevenson has been banned from the platform.\n“We have absolutely zero tolerance for this type of appalling behavior,” the spokesperson said. “The Dasher’s access to the platform has been permanently removed, and our team is supporting law enforcement with their investigation.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe New York Times and NBC News both report that it’s not clear if Stevenson has a lawyer who can comment on her behalf.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nWhatsApp, Meta’s messaging app that millions of Indians rely on daily, is facing a critical moment in India as recent government directions threaten to disrupt how the platform works for everyday users and businesses.\nIssued late last month and made public earlier this month, the directions ask certain app-based communication services to keep accounts continuously linked to an active SIM card and impose stricter controls on how the apps function across devices.\nNew Delhi says the measures are aimed at curbing rising cyber fraud in India, the world’s most populous nation. Digital advocacy groups, policy experts, and industry groups representing major digital platforms — including Meta — have warned, however, that the approach risks regulatory overreach and could disrupt legitimate use, especially in a country where WhatsApp has evolved into everyday infrastructure for personal communication and small-business commerce.\nThe directions, which app providers including Meta, Telegram, and Signal must comply with within 90 days of their issuance on November 28, require messaging apps to remain tied to the SIM card used at sign-up. The web and desktop versions of these apps also require users to log out every six hours and re-link their devices via a QR code to regain access.\n“Mandatory continuous SIM–device binding and periodic logout ensure that every active account and web session is anchored to a live, KYC-verified SIM, restoring traceability of numbers used in phishing, investment, digital arrest, and loan scams,” the telecom ministry said in a press release earlier this month, adding that India suffered cyber-fraud losses exceeding ₹228 billion (about $2.5 billion) in 2024 alone.\nThe Indian government has clarified that the rules do not apply when the SIM remains in the device, and the user is roaming.\nWhile the directions apply broadly to major instant messaging apps, their impact is likely to be felt most acutely by WhatsApp, which is used by more than 500 million people in India. The app’s adoption in India is also unusually deep. As much as 94% of WhatsApp’s Indian monthly user base opened the app daily in November, while 67% of WhatsApp Business users in the country did the same, according to Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. By comparison, 59% of WhatsApp monthly users in the U.S. opened the app daily, alongside 57% for WhatsApp Business.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany merchants in India rely on the WhatsApp Business app — a smartphone-based version of the service tailored for small enterprises — typically registering the account on a SIM-linked phone while handling customer conversations through WhatsApp’s web or desktop client on another device. Unlike larger companies that use WhatsApp’s Business APIs for automated, CRM-linked communication, these small businesses access their customers through WhatsApp Business and its companion web interface, meaning mandatory SIM binding and frequent forced logouts could break workflows for order-taking, support, and customer engagement.\nThe potential disruption in India comes as WhatsApp has been steadily expanding its multi-device and companion-device capabilities, allowing users and businesses to stay logged in across phones, browsers, and devices without relying on a single active smartphone.\nRapid expansion to deep entrenchment\nThe directions come as WhatsApp is undergoing a significant shift in India, its biggest market, with growth increasingly driven by retaining existing users rather than rapidly expanding its new user base.\nWhatsApp’s monthly active users in India on mobile devices are up 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to date, even as downloads have fallen nearly 49%, per Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. Compared with late 2022, WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India are up 24%, while downloads are down 14% over the same period, the market intelligence firm said.\n“It could be fair to say that user (MAU) growth for WhatsApp in India across the past few years has been driven more by retention (successfully re-engaging existing or previous users) than acquiring new users,” said Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower.\nData from Appfigures shows WhatsApp Business has consistently recorded more estimated first-time installs than WhatsApp Messenger in India since early 2024, reflecting how growth has increasingly been driven by merchant adoption rather than broad-based consumer expansion.\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\nPart of that pattern reflects how WhatsApp is used in India, said Randy Nelson, head of insights at Appfigures. It is common for merchants to maintain separate WhatsApp identities for personal and customer communication, often enabled by dual-SIM phones, while a single business can generate multiple installs across staff and shop devices.\nSensor Tower data points in the same direction. WhatsApp Business monthly active users in India were still growing year over year in late 2025 and are up more than 130% compared with 2021, far outpacing WhatsApp Messenger’s roughly 34% growth over the same period, the market intelligence firm’s data estimates.\nWhile overall engagement remains higher on WhatsApp — with Indian users opening the app daily and spending an average of 38 minutes a day in November, compared with 27 minutes on WhatsApp Business — the gap looks different in the U.S., where users spent about 23 minutes a day on WhatsApp and 27 minutes on WhatsApp Business, Sensor Tower estimates show.\nIndia’s directions raise “serious questions of technical feasibility”\nIn a statement last week, industry body Broadband India Forum (BIF), whose members include Meta, said the measures could result in “material inconvenience and service disruption on ordinary users,” adding that they raise “serious questions of technical feasibility.”\nThe directions hinge on a new and still-contested classification of Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs) under India’s telecom cybersecurity rules, said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of New Delhi-based public policy think tank The Dialogue, effectively placing messaging apps within a telecom framework — a shift from their traditional regulation under the country’s IT Act — through executive directions rather than formal legislation.\n“The directions derive their power not from statute but from delegated legislation,” Rizvi told TechCrunch. “Moreover, the lack of public consultations or technical working groups risks creating compliance friction without addressing the underlying fraud vectors.”\nIndia’s telecom ministry did not respond to a request for comments.\nFor now, companies including Meta have limited room to challenge the directions in court, according to tech policy experts.\nChallenging the directions would typically require showing either that they exceed the scope of the underlying law or that they violate constitutional protections, said Dhruv Garg, a tech policy advisor and partner at the Indian Governance and Policy Project — a high bar that may be difficult to meet in this case.\nMeta declined to comment on this article.\n"

    "body": "\nFintech startup Mesa has shut down its Homeowners Card, which awarded points to cardholders for paying their mortgages.\nA message on the Mesa website states that as of December 12, “all Mesa Homeowners Card accounts are closed,” adding, “All credit cards have been deactivated and you are no longer able to make any new purchases or earn Mesa Points.”\nA Mesa FAQ about the shutdown described this as “a business decision to close the Mesa Homeowners Card Program entirely.” TechCrunch has reached out to Mesa for additional comment on its future plans.\nThe startup launched just over a year ago, in November 2024, with $9.2 million in funding ($7.2 million in equity funding and $2 million in debt). It offered two products — mortgage loans with 1% cash back, as well as the credit card with rewards including cash back, travel, and offset mortgage payments.\nAt the time, CEO Kelley Halpin told TechCrunch that the startup had “taken what everybody loves about travel and dining cards to re-contextualize that for the homeowner/parent.”\nIn theory, you could earn points for home expenses by using any credit card with rewards, but Mesa said it structured its points program to incentivize spending related to home ownership.\n“So it’s not rewarding you on travel and dining spend; it’s rewarding you on gas, groceries, your HOA, utilities, home goods as well as your mortgage payment,” Halpin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBilt, which has a rewards card that allows customers to earn points on rent payments, says it will expand with points for mortgage payments when it launches a revamped card next year.\nMesa’s card shutdown has been covered by travel deals websites like One Mile at a Time and Upgraded Points, which say that Mesa cardmembers have been complaining about declined transactions for the past week, with the company initially claiming this was only a temporary outage.\nNow, it seems the only remaining way to redeem points earned on the Mesa card is through a statement credit at a rate of 0.6%.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nApple is releasing another tool to dial down Liquid Glass’ transparency with its release of iOS 26.2, out now. With the update, users will be able to control the transparency of the Lock Screen’s clock. The release follows an update that introduced a slider for controlling the opacity of Liquid Glass elements through the operating system, following user complaints that the changes made their iPhone or other Apple device too hard to read.\nLaunched with iOS 26, the new design language for Apple devices turns various interface elements like buttons, sliders, and notifications semi-transparent. The elements also refract light, giving them the optical qualities of glass.\nMeant to modernize Apple’s operating systems and potentially prepare for a world where the operating system moves to AI smart glasses, Liquid Glass received mixed reviews. Some found that the transparency made their device difficult to use, as it became tricky to read key items, like notifications or the name of an artist in Apple Music. In response to user complaints, Apple released a Liquid Glass tool in iOS 26.1 that allowed users to return their interface to a more “frosted” look, if desired.\nWith the slider for the Clock’s “glassiness,” Apple is again rolling back the transparency of the Liquid Glass update, but in the form of another user-controlled customization feature, instead of a global change.\nImage Credits:iPhone screenshot by TechCrunch\nThese tweaks are notable as they telegraph that perhaps Apple isn’t standing 100% behind the design overhaul as being perfect as is.\nThe timing of the change is worth noting, too. Earlier this month, Apple confirmed the design executive behind the Liquid Glass makeover, Alan Dye, was leaving the company for Meta. While it didn’t appear that Dye was pushed out, Apple replaced him with longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. \nUnlike Dye, Lemay’s career was spent in interface and interaction design — a skill set called for when it comes to fixing Liquid Glass, it can be argued.\n\niOS 26.2 brought other new features beyond the latest Liquid Glass tweak.\nAs in the betas, users can now create AirDrop codes to share with people not in their contacts, allowing them to become a “known” AirDrop contact for a 30-day period. The feature might make sense at work or in other scenarios where you need to share files or photos with someone not stored in your Contacts.\nAlso in iOS 26.2, the Reminders supports alarms; Apple News gains a Following tab at the bottom nav bar along with other navigation changes; Apple Music adds offline lyrics; and the Podcasts app adds AI-generated chapters for podcast episodes, a Podcast Mention feature for linking to other shows, and other changes. \nApple Watch owners will also now get a Sleep Score based on how well they slept and if they met their sleep goals. \nApple also released several important security updates across its flagship products on Friday, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches, to patch vulnerabilities used in an active hacking campaign.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhether or not Netflix’s $82.6 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. goes through, the deal encapsulates a fraught moment for Hollywood, as the entertainment business is increasingly overshadowed by tech giants.\nOn the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec and I discussed the deal’s implications, both for Netflix and the larger Hollywood ecosystem. Kirsten noted that it’s just the latest move bringing more consolidation to the media business, and she wondered whether it’s “too big a risk” for Netflix.\nMeanwhile, I discussed a call with Netflix executives where Wall Street analysts also seemed to be struggling to wrap their heads around the deal. And then of course there’s Paramount’s competing hostile bid — whatever happens, Warner Bros.’ days as a standalone company seem to be numbered.\nYou can read an edited preview of our conversation below.\nKirsten: I remember when Netflix was just a little baby startup and I got their [DVDs] in the mail. Here they are, all grown up, bidding for a legacy company. Did that run through your head when you saw the news?\nAnthony: Certainly symbolically, it’s this moment where the upstart has eaten Hollywood. There’ve been all these articles, even before this deal, saying, “Netflix is eating Hollywood, Netflix is transforming Hollywood.” Regardless of whether or not this deal ends up going through, Netflix will have transformed Hollywood, but this seems like the biggest — both symbolically but also substantively — one of the most dramatic things that can happen. \nThen there are all these other questions about: Will Netflix get regulatory approval? Will Paramount’s hostile bid succeed?\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhat jumped out to you is you were catching up on it, Kirsten?\nKirsten: Well, the first thing was I was like, can there be any more consolidation in this market? I mean, that was the big one for me, because if memory serves, Warner Bros. already went through like this consolidation with Discovery, right? So here we are again. There’s been so much consolidation that I have lost track of all of that.\nBut the second thought was what I immediately thought, what I kicked [off our discussion] with, which is really thinking about how Netflix [has grown], and there have been these dips in the road along its way, where the headlines have been about how it’s struggling, and will it remain relevant, and how can it do that? If they’re successful in the actual deal, [it would] potentially reflect [that] they have made it.\nBut then again, they have to execute on [running] an even bigger company than ever before. And so I guess my third thought on this is: Should they be buying this? Is this what it takes for them to expand? Is it a risk for them to take on so much? Why not just stay as they are? And I don’t know if you agree with me on that one. Is it too big of a risk? \nAnthony: I can see how it makes sense for Netflix. It’s a way to take a [content] library that is already quite large, and they’ve obviously had some very successful TV shows — less so on the movie side — [but] potentially, they just become so much stronger on the content side.\n[And] they’re suddenly now involved in all these other businesses, although the question is to what extent are they going to invest in things like the theatrical business, theme parks, making TV shows for other streaming services and networks, which are all businesses that Warner Bros. is in, and Netflix says it will continue to support. But we’ll see to what extent that’s true.\nSo it seems like something that can really benefit Netflix in some ways, but, at the same time, it does seem like this is a huge risk. If you go and look at the analyst call that Netflix’s executives did after announcing the deal, you can see that the analysts are wrestling with it and wondering “Okay, I can see that this grows your business, but does it grow your business [so much that it’s] worth an $82 billion deal?”\nAnd then of course, beyond the Netflix perspective, you have everybody else in Hollywood. There are all these maybe accurately hyperbolic headlines about: Is this the end of Hollywood? Is this the end of the movie theater business? All the unions are basically saying either, “This deal should be blocked” or “We’re very, very, very worried about this deal.” The theater owners are saying that.\nAnd so I think there’s A) Is this a good deal for Netflix? And B) is this a good deal for the entertainment business? I don’t have a good answer for either, [but] I think it’s more likely to be a good deal for Netflix than it is to be a good deal for the entertainment business.\nThough again, part of what to keep in mind as people weigh those options or think about possible outcomes here, is that because of the way that Paramount has forced Warner Bros. to consider these acquisition offers, it seems unlikely that Warner Bros. is going to be able to continue as an independent company — which, if you’re not a fan of media consolidation, that is disappointing.\n\n\n\n"

    "body": "\nFusion power has the potential to rewrite trillion-dollar energy markets, but first, startups have to prove their designs will work and won’t be too costly. Neither is easy, especially when considering the massive magnets and lasers used in many designs must be installed with millimeter precision or better.\nFusion startup Thea Energy says it’s pixel-inspired reactor and specialized control software should be able to generate power without requiring the same level of perfection.\n“It doesn’t have to be as good to begin with,” Brian Berzin, co-founder and CEO of Thea Energy,  told TechCrunch. “We have a way to tune out imperfections on the back end.” That margin of error could give Thea a leg up on the competition. \nFusion power plants promise to deliver gigawatts of clean power to the grid, but material and construction costs threaten to make them uncompetitive with cheap solar and wind. By building a power plant first and ironing out the kinks in software, Thea could help bring the cost of fusion power down dramatically.\nThis animation shows how Helios can be disassembled for maintenance.Image Credits:Thea Energy\nBut first the company has to build a working prototype. Today, Thea is publishing the details of its design, including the details of the physics that underpin it. The startup shared the paper exclusively with TechCrunch.\nThea is building a unique take on the stellarator, a specific type of reactor that uses magnets to whip the plasma fuel into shape. Magnets are one of the two main ways that fusion scientists keep plasma heat and confine plasma until fusion reactions occur. The other, known as inertial confinement, uses lasers or some other force to squeeze small fuel pellets.\nMost stellarators are built with magnets that look at home in a Salvador Dali painting. But Thea’s design uses a dozen larger magnets and hundreds of smaller ones to create what you might call a “virtual” stellarator.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a typical stellarator, the magnets are built to follow the contours of a shape that’s intended to work with the quirks of plasma, helping to confine it for longer using less power than tokamaks, which use a series of identically sized and shaped magnets. Yet stellarators have one major disadvantage: the irregular shape makes mass manufacturing magnets challenging.\nSo instead, Thea designed its reactor around small, identical superconducting magnets that are arranged in arrays. The startup will use software to control each magnet individually to generate magnetic fields that can replicate a stellarator’s wobbly shape.\nA cutaway view of plasma flowing through Helios’s reactor core.Image Credits:Thea Energy\nThe approach has several upsides. For one, it has allowed Thea to rapidly iterate on its magnet design. In the last two years, the company has tweaked the design more than 60 times, Berzin said. “Most fusion companies, you’re dealing with magnets that are the size of a car or a laser the size of a car or a widget the size of car. That unfortunately means one is $20 million and takes two years [to make],” he said.\nIt has also meant the company can use software controls to overcome any irregularities in the way the magnets were made or installed. To test its original control system, Thea built a three-by-three array of its magnets laced with sensors. The controls, which were derived from the physics of electromagnetism, worked well. But the company also wanted to see how AI might handle the task, so it also trained a new one using reinforced learning.\nThe team came away surprised at how well it all worked.\n“We purposefully threw curveballs at the array,” Berzin said. “We purposefully dismounted a magnet by literally over a centimeter. You could see it was super out of line. It was really hard for us to actually manufacture it so poorly.” The team also tested superconducting material from five different manufacturers along with intentionally defective material. “Every single time we did that, the control system, without us turning knobs and intervening, was able to tune out those defects,” he said.\nThea’s reactor design, Helios, will use two types of magnets. One the outside, 12 large magnets of four different shapes will do the heavy lifting to keep the plasma confined. They’re similar to those found on a tokamak, the type of doughnut-shaped reactor that competitor Commonwealth Fusion Systems is building. Inside the large coils, 324 smaller circular magnets will fine tune the shape of the plasma.\nThe startup predicts Helios will generate 1.1 gigawatts of heat, which a steam turbine will turn into 390 megawatts of electricity at a cost below $150 per megawatt-hour. The reactor will have to shut down for an 84-day maintenance period once every two years. If all goes well, that means its capacity factor — a measure of how much power it generates over a given period of time — will be 88%. That’s far better than today’s gas-fired power plants and almost as good as today’s nuclear power plants.\nHelios is still in the conceptual phase. Thea first has to build Eos, its initial fusion device that’s intended to prove the science behind the concept. Berzin said the company will announce a site for Eos in 2026 with plans to turn it on “around 2030.” \nAs it builds Eos, Thea plans to start work in parallel on Helios. It’s a similar approach to how Commonwealth Fusion Systems is moving forward with work on Arc, its first commercial power plant, while building Sparc, its demonstration plant.\nFor now, Berzin is looking forward to hearing what the fusion community thinks. “This is the release of the overview paper. This will be followed up by quite a substantial amount of work that will come out via peer review and publication,” he said. “Now is the moment for us to go and set up the partnerships, collaborations, get the end users engaged to go build the first one.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

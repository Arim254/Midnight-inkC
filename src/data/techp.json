Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.\n“Since launching last fall, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we’ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.”\nMeta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.\nUnveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.\nAt CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.\nMeta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.\nThis future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to reporting from IGN, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.\nThese Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its 18A manufacturing process which started production in 2025.\nIntel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 90s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its Intel Arc GPUs.\nEntering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.\nRogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Gaming\n"

    "body": "\nLMArena, a startup that originally launched as UC Berkeley research project in 2023, announced on Tuesday that it raised an $150 million Series A at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion. The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund UC Investments.\nThe startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a $100 million seed round in May at a $600 million valuation. This new rounds means it raised $250 million in about seven months.\nLMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.\nThe models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.\nThe company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang and was originally funded through grants and donations. \nLMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.\nIn September, it publicly launched a commercial service, AI Evaluations, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat trajectory, and the startup’s popularity, were enough for VCs to pile in for the Series A, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, The House Fund, LDVP, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Laude Ventures.\n"

    "body": "\nAMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone.\nAs part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.\nThe semiconductor giant revealed the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, the latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.\nThese new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction.\nThis is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.\nRahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.\n“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.\n“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”\nPCs that include either the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.\nNarwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. \nImage Credits:Narwal\nThe Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.\nNarwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.\nImage Credits:Narwal\nAlong with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:39 AM PST · January 6, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThreads is exploring games in chats, beginning with a basketball game. A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.\nThe game was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.\n\nLaunching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.\nAs with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.\nIt’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a hidden emoji game in DMs last year. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.\nThe internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently expanded its Communities feature with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it added a “disappearing posts” feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.\nWhile Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.\nAnnounced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.\nAmazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.\nAnd as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.\nNotably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.\nAmazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.\nFor people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nKate Lowry, a former vice president at Insight Partners, is suing the firm, alleging disability discrimination, gender discrimination, and wrongful termination, according to a suit filed on December 30 in San Mateo County, California, and seen by TechCrunch. Insight Partners did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nLowry told TechCrunch she filed the suit because she believes “too many powerful, wealthy people in venture act like it’s OK to break the law and systemically underpay and abuse their employees.”\n“It’s an oppressive system that reflect[s] broader trends in society that use fear, intimidation, and power to silence and isolate truth. I’m trying to change that.”\nLowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey & Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.  \nShe alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”  \nLowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.  \nSome comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.  \nWhen she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”  \nIn September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market. \nBy April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.  \nThe lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and other women went on to sue major tech companies.  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.\nBased on the Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).\nCrucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)\nImage Credits:Sean O'Kane\nThe vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.\nAnyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians. \nThe companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel. \nUber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.) \nThat said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced. \nLucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday announced that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "description": "Nvidia unveiled Alpamayo at CES 2026, which includes a reasoning vision language action model that allows an autonomous vehicle to think more like a human and provide chain-of-thought reasoning.",
    "body": "\nAt CES 2026, Nvidia launched Alpamayo, a new family of open source AI models, simulation tools, and datasets for training physical robots and vehicles that are designed to help autonomous vehicles reason through complex driving situations.\n“The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions.” \nAt the core of Nvidia’s new family is Alpamayo 1, a 10 billion-parameter chain-of-thought, reason-based vision language action (VLA) model that allows an AV to think more like a human so it can solve complex edge cases — like how to navigate a traffic light outage at a busy intersection — without previous experience. \n“It does this by breaking down problems into steps, reasoning through every possibility, and then selecting the safest path,” Ali Kani, Nvidia’s vice president of automotive, said Monday during a press briefing. \nOr as Huang put it during his keynote on Monday: “Not only does [Alpamayo] take sensor input and activate steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it’s about to take. It tells you what action it’s going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action. And then, of course, the trajectory.”\nAlpamayo 1’s underlying code is available on Hugging Face. Developers can fine-tune Alpamayo into smaller, faster versions for vehicle development, use it to train simpler driving systems, or build tools on top of it like auto-labeling systems that automatically tag video data or evaluators that check if a car made a smart decision. \n“They can also use Cosmos to generate synthetic data and then train and test their Alpamayo-based AV application on the combination of the real and synthetic dataset,” Kani said. Cosmos is Nvidia’s brand of generative world models, AI systems that create a representation of a physical environment so they can make predictions and take actions. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs part of the Alpamayo rollout, Nvidia is also releasing an open dataset with more than 1,700 hours of driving data collected across a range of geographies and conditions, covering rare and complex real-world scenarios. The company is additionally launching AlpaSim, an open source simulation framework for validating autonomous driving systems. Available on GitHub, AlpaSim is designed to recreate real-world driving conditions, from sensors to traffic, so developers can safely test systems at scale.\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nA hacktivist remotely wiped three white supremacist websites live onstage during their talk at a hacker conference last week, with the sites yet to return online.\nThe pseudonymous hacker, who goes by Martha Root — dressed as Pink Ranger from the Power Rangers — deleted the servers of WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal in real time at the end of a talk at the annual Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. \nRoot gave the talk alongside journalists Eva Hoffmann and Christian Fuchs, who wrote an article about the hacked sites for the German weekly paper Die Zeit in October. \nAs of this writing, WhiteDate, which Hoffmann described as a “Tinder for Nazis”; WhiteChild, a site that claimed to match white supremacists’ sperm and egg donors; and WhiteDeal, a sort-of Taskrabbit-esque labor marketplace for racists, are all offline.\nThe administrator of the three websites confirmed the hack on their social media accounts. \n“They publicly delete all my websites while the audience rejoices. This is cyberterrorism,” the administrator wrote on X on Sunday, vowing repercussions.\nThe administrator also claimed that Root deleted their X account before it was restored.\n\n‼️A German hacker known as \"Martha Root\" dressed as a pink Power Ranger and deleted a white supremacist dating website live onstageThis happened during the recent CCC conference.Martha had infiltrated the site, ran her own AI chatbot to extract as much information from users… pic.twitter.com/vpTEoFR8JR— International Cyber Digest (@IntCyberDigest) January 2, 2026\n\nRoot also published the data allegedly scraped from WhiteDate online. \nThe hacker said that they scraped WhiteDate’s public data and found “poor cybersecurity hygiene that would make even your grandma’s AOL account blush.” Root said that users’ images included precise geolocation metadata that “practically hands out home addresses with a side of awkward selfies.” \n“Imagine calling yourselves the ‘master race’ but forgetting to secure your own website — maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination,” Root wrote. \nThe leaked data includes users’ profiles with name, pictures, description, age, location (both containing precise coordinates and user-set country and state), gender, language, race, and other personal information that users uploaded. Root wrote on the site that “for now” there are no emails, passwords, or private conversations. \nAccording to the leaked data, WhiteDate had more than 6,500 users, of which 86% were men and 14% women. “A gender ratio that makes the Smurf village look like a feminist utopia,” Root wrote.\nRoot infiltrated the sites using AI chatbots that bypassed verification processes and were verified as “white,” according to the talks’ abstract. \nDDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest, announced that it has received “files and user information” from the three white supremacist websites. The collective, which calls this release “WhiteLeaks,” has not publicly released the data but is instead asking verified journalists and researchers to request access to the full 100 gigabyte dataset.\nThe administrator of the three websites did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment, which was sent to an email address shown during the conference talk. TechCrunch also sent an email to an address that appears on the public domain records of two of the three websites.

The Smart Bricks and Minifigures can sense nearby Smart Tags, which are 2×2 studless tiles with unique digital IDs that tell the Bricks and Minifigures how to act.\nIf the Smart Tag comes in a set for building a helicopter, for example, then the Smart Brick will light up and make propeller sounds that would help bring a helicopter to life. Its built-in accelerometer would make these lights and sounds more consistent with how you’re actually playing with the helicopter, since the Brick will be able to sense when the helicopter is zooming through the sky or turned upside down.\nImage Credits:LEGO\nThe Smart Bricks are powered by a patented ASIC chip, which is smaller than the size of a single Lego stud. The chip uses near-field magnetic positioning to recognize the Tags around it, as well as a miniature speaker, accelerometer, and LED array. Lego also developed a Bluetooth-based protocol called BrickNet, which allows multiple Smart Bricks to recognize each other and operate in tandem. The company claims that BrickNet is protected by enhanced encryption and privacy controls (all of which is necessary, but imagine a world where hacking into toys wasn’t a concern!).\nThere’s no setup required to pair the elements of the Smart Play system, making it easy for kids to get started — and parents will be pleased to note that there are no screens involved in the Smart system at all. However, Lego’s website says that there will be a Smart Tag for animating Lego toilets, so… there’s that.\nLego’s first two Smart Play sets — which are both Star Wars-themed — will launch on March 1, though preorders open on Friday. The “Luke’s Red Five X-wing” building set will retail for $69.99, while the larger “Throne Room Duel and A-wing” set will cost $159.99. These sets use the Smart Play system to animate characters like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, allowing them to interact with Smart Tags, which enable Lightsaber duels among other Star Wars-related capabilities.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nThe founder of a U.S.-based spyware company, whose surveillance products allowed customers to spy on the phones and computers of unsuspecting victims, pleaded guilty to federal charges linked to his long-running operation. \npcTattletale founder Bryan Fleming entered a guilty plea in a San Diego federal court on Tuesday to charges of computer hacking, the sale and advertising of surveillance software for unlawful uses, and conspiracy.\nThe plea follows a multi-year investigation by agents with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a unit within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. HSI began investigating pcTattletale in mid-2021 as part of a wider probe into the industry of consumer-grade surveillance software, also known as “stalkerware.”\nThis is the first successful U.S. federal prosecution of a stalkerware operator in more than a decade, following the 2014 indictment and subsequent guilty plea of the creator of a phone surveillance app called StealthGenie. Fleming’s conviction could pave the way for further federal investigations and prosecutions against those operating spyware, but also those who simply advertise and sell covert surveillance software.\nHSI said that pcTattletale is one of several stalkerware websites under investigation.\nA spokesperson for ICE did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch, nor did a representative for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, which brought the charges against Fleming.\nFleming’s lawyer Marcus Bourassa did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\npcTattletale was a remote surveillance app that had been under Fleming’s control since at least 2016. Stalkerware apps like pcTattletale allow ordinary consumers to buy software capable of tracking people and their data without their knowledge, including romantic partners and spouses, which is illegal in the United States and many other countries.\nOnce physically planted on a person’s phone or computer (usually with knowledge of the victim’s passcode or login), the app would continuously upload a copy of the victim’s information, including messages, photos, and location data, to pcTattletale’s servers and make the data accessible to whoever planted the spyware.\nFleming shut down pcTattletale in 2024 following a data breach, which saw a hacker deface the company’s website and steal reams of data from its servers, including identifiable information belonging to its customers and their victims. More than 138,000 customers who had signed up to use pcTattletale had their breached information shared with data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned. \nAt the time, Fleming told TechCrunch that his company was “out of business and completely done,” after deleting the contents of pcTattletale’s servers.   \nDespite the shutdown, federal agents were already far into their investigation of Fleming’s illegal spyware business.\nFeds search founder’s $1.2M home\nHSI began investigating pcTattletale in June 2021 after finding over 100 stalkerware websites offering surveillance products, many of which advertised lawful uses of the software, such as monitoring children or employees.\npcTattletale stood out because it was specifically advertising its spyware for “surreptitiously spying on spouses and partners,” wrote HSI special agent Nick Jones in the 2022 affidavit in support of a search warrant for Fleming’s home. The affidavit was unsealed in early December 2025 ahead of Fleming’s anticipated plea hearing. \nCrucially for investigators, Fleming was believed to be operating pcTattletale from his home in Bruce Township, Michigan, well within reach of U.S. law enforcement — unlike many overseas stalkerware operators who are not.  \nUnlike some stalkerware operators who shield their identities to avoid legal and reputational risks from working with spyware, Fleming was brazen in how he advertised pcTattletale. In videos posted on YouTube, Fleming could be seen at his home promoting pcTattletale as its creator and founder. \n\nA surveillance photo taken by HSI agents outside of Bryan Fleming’s home in MichiganImage Credits:Justice Department (affidavit)\n\nAccording to the affidavit, HSI obtained a warrant in 2022 allowing the search of Fleming’s email accounts. HSI said the emails showed that Fleming “knowingly assisted customers seeking to spy on nonconsenting, non-employee adults.” \nFederal agents later surveilled Fleming’s home to confirm it was in fact him. \nJones also went undercover to collect evidence, posing as an affiliate marketer under the guise of promoting the spyware in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. As a result of this operation, Jones exchanged emails with Fleming, in which the pcTattletale founder provided images intended for banner ads that promoted the spyware as a way to “catch a cheater,” which made it clear Fleming wanted to market his product for illegal purposes. \nBy November 2022, HSI had obtained permission from a U.S. judge to search Fleming’s home, which agents raided soon after, seizing an unknown number of items. Agents also obtained records associated with Fleming’s bank and his PayPal account, which had transactions totaling more than $600,000 as of the end of 2021. \nThe search warrant was filed under seal amid concerns that Fleming could destroy or tamper with evidence. Fleming has since sold the house for $1.2 million, per public records.\nFleming’s conviction is a win for privacy advocates and campaigners who work to counter the proliferation of stalkerware and raise awareness to its dangers.\nEva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the co-founder of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, commented on Fleming’s guilty plea when reached by TechCrunch.\n“One of the most striking aspects of this case is the extent to which stalkware companies like pcTattletale operate out in the open,” said Galperin. “This is because the people behind these companies so rarely face consequences for selling tools that they themselves say are explicitly for monitoring other people’s devices without their knowledge or consent.” \n“I hope that this case changes the risk calculus for makers of stalkerware,” said Galperin.\nFleming is expected to be sentenced later this year.\n——\nIf you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

    "body": "\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.\nThe magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.\nAfter decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.\nKey components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”\nEach magnet weighs 24 tons and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic fieldImage Credits:Commonwealth Fusion Systems\nWhen installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.\nTo hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.\nTo work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”\nCFS is working with Nvidia and Siemens to produce a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactorImage Credits:Commonwealth Fusion Systems\nThe hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.\nBuilding Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates. \nMumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nToday at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.\n“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”\nThe Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.\n\n\n\nRubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.\nNamed for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.\nExplaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems. \n“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.\nRubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\nWatch Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reveal what he described as the state of the art in AI hardware: the new Rubin computing architecture.“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang… pic.twitter.com/MhGVqytX04— TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) January 5, 2026\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

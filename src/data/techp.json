    "body": "\nElevenLabs struck a deal with actors Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to AI-generate their voices, the company announced this week.\nHollywood and AI have an up-and-down relationship, with its guardrails — or lack thereof — serving among the main concerns that led to the Hollywood strikes a few years ago. Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI.\nLast year, Meta announced that its Meta AI would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice.\nElevenLabs also announced this week that it was launching a marketplace to let brands use authorized AI-generated voices of celebrities, which will include Caine and other names like Liza Minnelli and Dr. Maya Angelou. ElevenLabs is one of the more popular AI unicorn companies and has backers including a16z and ICONIQ.  \n\n\tTopics\n"

    "body": "\nMicrosoft is taking a page from OpenAI’s playbook, literally. Bloomberg first reported that the tech giant plans to leverage its partner’s custom chip development to bolster its own struggling semiconductor efforts, a move that looks increasingly pragmatic given Microsoft’s lackluster performance compared to rivals like Google and Amazon.\nThe arrangement is straightforward: OpenAI is designing AI chips with Broadcom, and Microsoft gets full access to the innovations. “As they innovate even at the system level, we get access to all of it,” CEO Satya Nadella explained on a newly released interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, describing plans to adopt OpenAI’s designs and then extend them for Microsoft’s own purposes.\nUnder a revised partnership agreement, Microsoft secured intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s chip designs while maintaining access to the company’s AI models through 2032. The only carve-out? OpenAI’s consumer hardware, which the ChatGPT maker presumably wants to develop and sell independently.\nThe collaboration underscores a broader reality in tech: building cutting-edge AI chips is brutally difficult and expensive. Rather than continuing to struggle alone, Microsoft is betting that OpenAI’s expertise — plus a smartly structured contract — can accelerate its own ambitions.\n"

This round more than doubles the company’s previous valuation of $9.9 billion, which it achieved in its $900 million Series C round in June.\nThis most recent fundraise was led by co-led by Accel, an existing investor, and Coatue, which is new to the cap table. Strategic investors including Nvidia (an enterprise customer) and Google (an AI model supplier) also joined the round.\nJoshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital led the company’s prior two rounds and participated in this round as well.\nCursor’s co-founder and CEO Michael Truell told the Wall Street Journal that the capital from the round will be put toward developing Composer, an AI model released by Cursor in October.\nCursor still relies on outside AI models from companies including Google, OpenAI and Anthropic to power its platform, but the plan is for Composer to carry some of that load in the future.\nNext year could be a very interesting one for Cursor. While the company is still seeing strong growth, OpenAI and Anthropic are both sharpening their AI coding products as the market for AI development tools continues to get more competitive.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAI, cursor, Enterprise, Enterprise, Fundraising, nvidia, OpenAI, Startups, Thrive Capital, United States, vibe coding\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Fundraising\n"

    "body": "\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into how Google is implementing its “site reputation abuse policy” and its impact on publishers.\nThe Commission said on Thursday that it had found signs that Google is using the policy to push news media and other publishers’ websites and content lower in search rankings when they include content from their business partners, and that the policy “appears to directly impact a common and legitimate way for publishers to monetise their websites and content.”\nThe EC is now investigating if Google’s policy impacts publishers’ “freedom to conduct legitimate business, innovate, and cooperate with third-party content providers.” \nAccording to Google’s page on the policy, the measures are aimed at curbing websites that seek to manipulate search rankings by publishing other websites’ content on their site in an attempt to take advantage of their high ranking signal. \n“Unfortunately, the investigation announced today into our anti-spam efforts is misguided and risks harming millions of European users,” Pandu Nayak, chief scientist of Search at Google, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “And the investigation is without merit: a German court has already dismissed a similar claim, ruling that our anti-spam policy was valid, reasonable, and applied consistently.”\n“Google’s anti-spam policy is essential to how we fight deceptive pay-for-play tactics that degrade our results,” he added. “Our anti-spam policy helps level the playing field, so that websites using deceptive tactics don’t outrank websites competing on the merits with their own content.”\nIf the investigation yields proof that Google infringed the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), the Commission can charge fines worth up to 10% of Alphabet’s global annual turnover. And if the Commission finds that the infringement is systematic, it can also impose remedies, which can include forced divestiture of businesses, or banning the company from making acquisitions related to the infringement.\nThe European Commission in 2023 designated Google Search as a “core platform service” under the DMA, which gives the bloc’s executive arm extra powers to regulate the tech giant. Google Search is already under a separate investigation for breaching DMA rules related to self-preferential treatment of its own services.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nMusic streaming service Spotify said it is introducing a new shuffle option that repeats fewer suggested songs.\nThe company originally launched Smart Shuffle for paid users in 2023, a feature that added new songs to a playlist’s queue based on users’ previously played songs and their preferences. Users previously could not disable this feature.\nWith this new update, the company is making shuffle with fewer repeats the default for paid users. This means users will hear fewer songs from their recent listening history and more new songs.\nIf they want the standard Smart Shuffle, they can go to Settings > Playback and choose the “Standard” option under the Shuffle Mode section.\nSpotify added that both free and premium users can tap any song to play next while shuffling without rearranging the queue. \nLauren Saunders, product director for personalization at Spotify, said that shuffle follows randomness, which means there is a higher probability of listening to the same songs again.\n“That’s the thing about real randomness: It can be clumpy. Just like you can roll three sixes in a row, a purely random shuffle might never seem to play the song you’re hoping for, or it might stack the same artist or album closer together than your brain expects. The math is right, but the feeling is wrong,” Saunders said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Instead of giving you one random order and calling it a day, we now generate hundreds of truly random versions of your playlist. Then we score each one for freshness, looking at how recently you’ve played certain songs, how much variety is packed into the opening stretch, and whether you’re getting repeats too soon,” she said about the new approach to shuffle.\nAlong with this feature, Spotify is also releasing an AI-powered recap feature for audiobooks to let users catch up on a story to the point where they stopped listening. Users will see a recap button at the top of the audiobook’s page, which will play a summary of the story so far.\nImage Credits: Spotify\nSpotify said that the recaps will show up after users have listened to at least 15-20 minutes of a book and are regularly updated as they progress. It added that Spotify is not using audiobook content to train models, and recaps don’t replicate the original narration.\nThe feature is currently available on iOS in beta for a selection of English-language titles.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify is shaking up its premium offering and introducing new tiers called Premium Lite, Premium Standard, and Premium Platinum in five markets, including India, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. \nPrior to this change, in markets like India, Spotify offered Premium Standard, Duo (for two people), and Family plans for six people, with features like ad-free listening, offline support, and high-quality audio. The new Premium tiers will offer these features in different configurations, based on the plan.\nFor instance, the Premium Lite plan priced at ₹139 per month ($1.57) will get ad-free listening and 160kbps audio quality. The Premium Standard plan, priced at ₹199 per month($2.25), has offline support and 320kbps audio quality. The most costly Premium Platinum plan at ₹299 ($3.37) per month will give users access to the newly launched Lossless tier, along with two other seats that can share the account.\nImage Credits: Spotify\nThe Platinum plan also gives users access to Spotify’s AI DJ feature that provides commentary while playing songs and lets you make requests. And it offers access to the audio platform’s AI-powered playlist creation tool. \nIn September, Spotify announced integration with AI software like rekordbox, Serato, and djay, to import users’ libraries to create sets and mixes. The Platinum tier will allow users to access this integration, as well.\nNotably, these features have existed in other markets such as North America and Europe for some time. But the five countries where Spotify is launching these new premium tiers are gaining access to some of these features for the first time.\nMultiple reports over the past few years have hinted at the company introducing a “super premium” plan with access to the lossless tier. While at the moment, this plan exists only for select markets, the company could extend it globally to all markets, putting lossless into the highest tier. (At the moment, all Premium users in more than 50 countries can experience tracks at 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC quality.)\nThe company said that if users have an existing account, their subscription will carry over. However, new subscribers won’t be able to pay for the old Duo or the Family plan and will have to choose one of the new plans instead.\nFor new subscribers in India, Spotify is increasing the subscription prices while reducing some of the benefits users got in the previous Premium plan. The Standard individual plan currently costs ₹139 ($1.57) per month, which is the price of the new Lite plan. The Family plan costs ₹229 ($2.58) per month with inclusion for six members. Account sharing is only possible with the new Platinum plan that costs ₹299 ($3.37) and allows for the inclusion of three users. Users who might not care about lossless streaming or AI features won’t have any option.\nThe company has made changes to its pricing plans in other markets as well. In the last two years, it has bumped the U.S. pricing from $9.99 to $11.99 per month across two $1 jumps.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

(Users who use an authenticator app are unaffected.)\nX said this was part of an effort to retire the older twitter.com domain, which currently redirects to x.com. That change took effect in May 2024. The problem is that passkeys and security keys are digitally tied to the old twitter.com domain and can’t be transferred to x.com. That means users have to manually un-enroll and re-enroll using the new x.com domain.\nAs part of the switchover, X warned that after November 10, customers would have their accounts locked until they re-enroll or choose another method of two-factor authentication. \nNow that the deadline has passed, plenty of users are reporting that they’ve been locked out of their accounts and can’t re-enroll their passkey or security key, citing error messages or getting caught in an endless loop.\nThis is the latest issue to beset X, now owned by Elon Musk after he bought Twitter, as it was known then, for $44 billion. Since taking charge of the social networking site, the company has experienced massive layoffs and countless controversies.\nX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk, who now owns X, has been posting as usual, presumably unaffected by the change.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor the last two years, LinkedIn has tried to infuse AI into different parts of its platforms, including ad copies, content creation, personalized digests, hiring assistance, job hunting advice, and learning. The company is now finally adding AI to one of the most used parts of the site: search.\nEarlier this year, the company released a job search tool for members in the U.S., allowing them to search for jobs using natural language queries. Now, the company is extending the feature to people search.\nUsers can use queries like “Find me investors in the healthcare sector with FDA experience,” people who “co-founded a productivity company and are based in NYC,” or “Who in my network can help me understand wireless networks.”\nImage Credits: LinkedIn\nUntil now, LinkedIn’s search has been more complicated. You can type in a few words to find the right people or rely on many different LinkedIn filters in the hope of getting the right results. Plus, you also have to think about what kinds of words you might want to use to get the best out of the search system.\n“With lexical search, you have to know the exact title of the person, or you need to wrestle with filters to find the right person, maybe. And if you didn’t know the right combination, the right person remained undiscovered. The new AI-powered people search is designed to be the fastest path to the person who can help you the most,” Rohan Rajiv, senior director of product management at LinkedIn, told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe company said in its early testing, it has seen people use this to find others who can help them with their next job opportunity, expand their business, or boost their career prospects.\nSearch has been one area where all internet platforms have been rushing to add AI. Seeing people gravitate towards chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity for answers, incumbent search engines like Google, Bing, Brave, and DuckDuckGo have added AI-powered answers. There are plenty of startups working on AI-powered people search as well. Reddit has also leaned heavily into AI-powered search and locked down its platform’s data, asking other companies to sign a licensing agreement for AI training and usage.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLinkedIn is one of the most used sites in AI demos for AI agents, browsers, and assistants. However, the Microsoft-owned company has not put restrictions on its data just yet.\n“I think we are still early in this age of browsers and how they are working on behalf of people. I think over time, we will have a more sturdy policy [around browsers],” Rajiv said.\n“On a broader note, I have seen a lot of demos that try to reason over a person’s LinkedIn network. This is sort of an area where I think it is going to be hard to find a substitute for the real thing because this is the worst the search has ever been.”\nImage Credits: LinkedIn\nLinkedIn is rolling out AI-powered people search to premium users in the U.S. with plans to expand it to other geographies in the coming months. People who will have access to this feature will see “I’m looking for…” in the search bar instead of “Search.”\nThe search is not perfect. You will get different results when you use a query like “people who co-founded a YC startup” as compared to using “Y Combinator” in the query. Also, when you search for “people who co-founded a voice AI startup,” some folks who have a LinkedIn top voice badge show up. \nThe company said it is working on improving the way the search tool understands the query.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLos Angeles-based electric truck startup Harbinger has raised $160 million in a Series C funding round co-led by FedEx, as it scales up production of its commercial vehicle program.\nAs part of the investment, FedEx has ordered 53 of Harbinger’s electric truck chassis, which the startup says will be ready by the end of this year.\nFounded in 2022 by former employees of now-defunct EV startup Canoo and battery company QuantumScape, Harbinger set out to build medium-duty, commercial truck chassis — and basically nothing else. That focus on keeping things simple helped the company raise a $100 million Series B in January and start production of its truck chassis this year, just three years after its inception.\nFedEx is Harbinger’s most recognizable customer to date, though the startup has spent the last few years also working with RV-builder THOR Industries. THOR co-led this Series C round with FedEx, as did the Technology Impact Fund at Capricorn, which was an early Tesla investor. \nPrevious investors in Harbinger, like Leitmotif (a new VC firm backed by Volkswagen), Tiger Global, Maniv Mobility, and Schematic Ventures participated in the round as well.\nFedEx has spent a decade looking to add electric trucks to its nationwide delivery fleet. In 2018, the logistics giant took a gamble on another Los Angeles-based startup called Chanje, placing an order for 1,000 of its imported Chinese delivery vans in a deal that ultimately ended in a lawsuit. (Chanje collapsed soon after.)\nThe market for commercial electric trucks and vans has matured since then, though the field still doesn’t have many players. General Motors recently gave up its BrightDrop delivery van program after a few lackluster years. Sales of Ford’s E-Transit van have plummeted. Rivian has supplied around 25,000 electric vans to Amazon, but is yet to lock down another major commercial customer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHarbinger is focused on trucks that are larger than the BrightDrop, Ford or Rivian vans, and it has found early success in that part of the market. It has sold over 200 chassis this year alone, and recently announced an expansion into the Canadian market.\n“FedEx’s participation signals a demand for innovation in the medium-duty truck sector and for an electric model that helps advance business and sustainability goals at the same time,” Dipender Saluja, the managing partner of Capricorn Investment Group’s Technology Impact Fund, said in a statement. “Over the last two decades, medium-duty truck fleets have generally deployed small volumes of demonstration electric trucks. The industry is now ready to move to mass adoption, with Harbinger leading that scale up.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nOne of the most effective use cases to have emerged from modern AI models is their ability to understand the human voice better, which has led to more accurate dictation tools. One such Mac tool, Willow, is launching an iOS app to let users type with their voice across all apps.\nSimilar to Wispr Flow, Willow’s keyboard transcribes your voice and also formats the message according to the context. The app, which supports over 100 languages, lets you define your own vocabulary terms or create different writing styles across app categories like work, messaging, email, and others.\nOne key advantage of Willow’s app is that there is a full keyboard available to type, whereas Wispr Flow only offers a numeric keyboard. This helps with quick edits to modify some words or sentences rather than typing them out. Plus, you don’t have to switch to another keyboard when you want to type some words instead of speaking them.\nImage Credits Willow\nWillow was founded by Allan Guo and Lawrence Liu, who attended Stanford and dropped out to build a startup. The duo got into Y Combinator in the summer of 2024 with a different set of co-founders (who have now left the company), and their initial idea was in healthcare — specifically to build software to manage assisted living facilities. However, the idea didn’t stick, and for a year, the company tried to build different things.\n“While we were working on healthcare solutions, we noticed that doctors have voice AI scribes that record conversations with patients and create documents for follow-ups. I had a lot of conversations with doctors; they said these notetakers were very useful to them. This nudged us to build a voice AI tool for knowledge workers and other users,” Guo told TechCrunch over a call. \nGuo added that he chose not to build another AI notetaker because he felt that the market was saturated. Instead, the dictation space was more appealing as a lot of communication takes place outside meetings. He said that the company uses a series of models and focuses heavily on tuning its text-to-text pipeline, which is based on Meta’s Llama models, for formatting and personalization\nImage Credits: Willow\nThe startup then moved its YC batch to Spring 2025 to launch the product. The company said that since the launch, it has grown 50% month over month in terms of users. It also has enterprise customers like Uber, Heidi Health, and Zego using the tool for dictation with features like custom team vocabulary.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWillow has raised $4.5 million from Box Group, Y Combinator, Burst Capital, and angel investors such as HubSpot’s Dharmesh Shah; Gusto’s Tomer London; Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; ex-Yelp COO Kipp Bodnar; Opendoor CEO Kaz Nejatian; Adam Guild, co-founder and CEO of the restaurant software company Owner; and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen.\nMullen said that he believes that the most amazing user interfaces in the future are going to be voice-led.\n“I was really impressed with Allan’s vision around not just creating a great dictation app but, long term, aiming for creating an interface that can control your computer,” he said. “When I am writing through Willow, I need to make fewer edits than I had to with a computer’s built-in dictation system.”\nMullen pointed out that one of his favorite workflows was that on desktop, you can also use the “Hey Willow” assistant to instruct the app to write things like email replies in your own voice.\nThe startup competes with other players like Wispr Flow, which has raised more than $56 million in funding to date; Monologue, which is part of Every’s subscription bundle; and the YC-backed startups Aqua, Talktastic, Superwhisper, and Betterdication.\nGuo said that in the coming months, it plans to do platform expansion with Windows and Android, along with better personalization to reduce the number of manual edits users have to do post dictation. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGenAI has become a key part of coding workflows, but most companies struggle to track its use, let alone its return on investment. Israeli startup Milestone hopes to help with a platform designed to correlate AI tool usage with engineering metrics, including code quality.\nThe catch is that these companies have to give Milestone access to their codebases, a bet that investors initially questioned, CEO and co-founder Liad Elidan told TechCrunch. But with customers including Kayak, Monday, and Sapiens, the startup has now raised a $10 million seed funding round led by San Francisco-based venture firm Heavybit and Israeli fund Hanaco Ventures.\nIn an unusual arrangement, Elidan and Milestone’s CTO had gone years without meeting in person by the time they started fundraising. Unlike most of Milestone’s Israel-based team members, Professor Stephen Barrett lives in Ireland and teaches computer science at Trinity College Dublin, where Elidan was once his student and the two bonded through software projects.\nDespite the distance, the duo kept in touch over the years and eventually decided to found a startup focused on engineering efficiency, just as coding assistants and other code-generation tools were taking off. GitHub Copilot has since crossed the bar of 20 million users, but companies still lack visibility into how these tools are used and are impacting productivity.\nAccording to Elidan, Milestone answers these questions by relying on four pillars — codebases, project management platforms, team structure, and the codegen tools themselves — to create what he describes as “a genAI data lake.” In practice, this gives organizations actionable data on which teams use AI and to what effect — thanks to their own information.\nArmed with this data, managers under constant pressure to leverage AI to push productivity are, for instance, able to measure feature delivery speed, Elidan said, but also to find out whether recent bugs were caused by AI-generated code, and to take informed decisions on where to implement these tools. \nThis also gives Milestone a front-row seat on ROI — the “holy grail question” that it aims to answer granularly for its customers. But on a high level, he said, “We don’t have a customer that used Milestone and said, ‘Okay, GenAI doesn’t help me, I’m going to revoke all my licenses.’ It’s actually the opposite. They want to try more Gen AI tools.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis fast-paced adoption also means that Milestone has to keep up with a rapidly evolving landscape. “It used to be auto-completes, then it was chat, then it was agentic-based chat, and it keeps going,” Elidan said. \nThat’s also where Barrett’s academic background helps the team understand the wave of transformation its customers are going through. “A lot of the ways we used to think about engineering are going to have to change,” the professor told TechCrunch. “I think in some sense, AI is filling out the team, and engineers are now becoming managers.”\nTo keep up with the tools that power this wave, Milestone says it has partnered with many vendors, such as GitHub, Augment Code, Qodo, Continue and Atlassian — the company that powers Jira and whose venture arm Atlassian Ventures also participated in this seed round. \nThe round was also supported by angel investors, including GitHub cofounder Tom Preston-Werner, former AT&T CEO John Donovan, Accenture’s senior tech advisor Paul Daugherty, and Datadog’s ex-president Amit Agrawal — who all understand that what Milestone is building is relevant for the enterprise market, Elidan said.\nThat enterprise focus was deliberate from day one, with Milestone even saying no to prospective clients that were too small—”a very hard thing to do,” Elidan said, but one that gave the startup clarity around a roadmap requiring enterprise credentials and features. Focus would be his main advice to other founders, and Milestone is taking it: the startup won’t expand into measuring GenAI’s impact on marketing or other functions, even as it grows.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nCash App released a slate of new features as part of its fall update, including an AI chatbot that can answer questions about users’ finances, a new benefits program, and the ability to discover places that accept Bitcoin payments and make Bitcoin payments using USD.\nThe company is launching an assistant called Moneybot that can answer questions about spending patterns and income, and provide insights for maintaining savings and setting aside money for investments.\nThe chatbot will be available to select users at launch, with broader availability planned for the coming months. Users can ask questions like “Can you show me my monthly income, expenses, and spending patterns?” to get reports about their accounts. The bot also surfaces suggestions for actions like splitting a bill, checking a bitcoin balance, or requesting money from someone.\nImage Credits: Cash App\n“Consumers today are given a host of data around their financial transactions and account balances, but Moneybot takes it a step further by helping to turn those insights into action. No two financial journeys are the same, so we’ve built Moneybot to learn each customer’s habits and tailor its suggestions in real-time,” Cameron Worboys, head of product design at Cash App, said in a statement.\nJack Dorsey-led Block, which owns Cash App and Square, has been creating new ways to promote Bitcoin payments. Last month, it released an integrated Bitcoin solution for merchants to easily receive the cryptocurrency into a wallet. Customers can now discover places that accept Bitcoin through a new map and use USD to pay in cryptocurrency without holding it. The company said it uses the Lightning Network, a layer-2 payment network built on top of Bitcoin, to facilitate transactions via QR codes.\nImage Credits: Cash App\nThe company said that soon it will also allow some customers to send and receive stablecoins through the app.\nBlock is also changing the benefits structure for Cash App customers. Previously, customers who had direct deposits of at least $300 per month qualified for benefits like a 3.5% yield. Now, the company is starting a new program called Cash App Green, where users who either spend $500 or more per month through the Cash App Card or Cash App Pay, or receive deposits or at least $300, qualify for benefits.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits: Cash App\nThese benefits will include a higher borrowing limit — up to $400 for first-time borrowers and a limit increase of up to $300 for others; free overdraft coverage of up to $200 for Cash App Card transactions; free in-network ATM withdrawals; up to 3.5% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances; and five customized weekly offers at different stores.\nBlock said that this new program will make up to 8 million accounts eligible for benefits under the Cash App Green program.\nThe company is also offering a 3.5% APY for teen accounts without any balance limits.

    "body": "\nWhen former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt, someone from the audience asked him if HBO’s hit satire “Silicon Valley” would be revived. Costolo, who was a writer for the show, essentially answered no (at timestamp 38:17).\nWhile the writers talk about that regularly, he said, they don’t pursue it because today’s actual Silicon Valley is so bizarre, it can’t be parodied.  \nThe latest case in point is a new company called Clad Labs that launched out of Y Combinator this week. Clad’s product is so outside-the-box that people thought it was an April Fools’ joke in November. \nBut it’s a real product, founder Richard Wang told TechCrunch. The product is called “Chad: The Brainrot IDE.” It is yet another vibe coding integrated development environment — an IDE is the software developers use to code — but with a twist. While waiting for the AI coding tool to finish its task, the developer can mess around with their favorite brainrot activities within a window of the IDE. \nOr, as the company’s website advertises: “Gamble while you code. Watch TikToks. Swipe on Tinder. Play minigames. This isn’t a joke — it’s Chad IDE, and it’s solving the biggest productivity problem in AI-powered development that nobody’s talking about.” \nThe founders say their IDE increases productivity by helping with “context switching.” Their argument is, by doing your brainrot activities within the IDE itself, as soon as the AI is done with the task, you’ll get right back to work rather than be focused on your phone or browser. \nReaction on X was mixed. While some people thought it was a fake satire, others thought it was a good — or a terrible — idea.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLike it or hate it, everyone had an opinion, even Jordi Hays, co-host of the enthusiastically pro-tech podcast TBPN. Hays penned a post on the product called, “Rage Baiting is for Losers.” In it he said of Chad IDE: “On one hand it’s funny. On the other hand, what are we doing here and why does this belong on the official YC account?” \nHe argued that products like Chad IDE and Cluely have moved rage bait from a marketing gimmick to a “product strategy” and “it really should not be.” He urged YC to start teaching founders that “rage baiting is for losers.” \nThis is particularly interesting advice from someone who, as a founder, had mastered viral marketing without rage. Hays and his wife Sarah founded Party Round, a funding startup that went viral for their friendly marketing gimmicks like launching NFT versions of top “helpful” VCs. (Party Round rebranded to Capital and sold to Rho in 2024.) \nWang tells TechCrunch what the haters don’t get about his brainrot IDE is that it wasn’t intended to be rage bait. The founders hope it becomes a genuinely beloved AI vibe coder for consumer-app type developers. They want to give these folks a consumer app-like experience in an IDE.\nWhile the product is real, it’s not available to the public yet. \n”We’re currently in a closed beta,” Wang said. Right now, Chad is attempting to build a “community” of users who like the idea. Clad Labs hopes to open the product to the public soon, but for now, users must get an invite from someone already in the beta.\nNo doubt there’s a certain type of developer who would love Chad. But whatever the future holds for this product, one thing is true: It is nearly impossible to parody Silicon Valley these days. \n"

    "body": "\nWhen Hannan Happi started thinking about how to solve the AI power crisis, he kept one figure in mind: one cent per kilowatt-hour.\n“We went through all sorts of configurations and designs,” Happi, co-founder and CEO of Exowatt, told TechCrunch. “They all look different from each other. We tried to learn from everyone one of them: How do I reduce structural costs? How do I reduce maintenance costs? How do I optimize for this?”\nAfter years of brainstorming and building, Exowatt’s first step toward that goal is a simple box the size of a shipping container topped with a clear awning. Inside is similarly simple. If Exowatt can deliver on its promise of delivering cheap solar power that generates electricity 24-7, it could upend the data center market and broader energy world, delivering round-the-clock power at very low cost.\nTo scale production in pursuit of the one-cent per kWh target, Exowatt has raised an additional $50 million in an extension to its $70 million Series A round that closed in April, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. \nThe extension was led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries with participation from Atomic, BAM, Bay Bridge Ventures, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global, the Florida Opportunity Fund, Massive VC, New Atlas Capital, Overmatch, Protagonist, and StepStone. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz and Sam Altman.\nHappi said that Exowatt wasn’t looking to raise additional capital after the April round, but “strong momentum we saw in the market” and “strong investor interest” encouraged him to take the new money at a higher valuation.\nExowatt’s backlog is currently about 10 million P3 units representing 90 gigawatt-hours of capacity, he said. “The goal is to scale as fast as possible to the millions and ultimately billions of units,” he said. The company should hit its one-cent target when production hits around 1 million units per year, Happi said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExowatt is basically repackaging a technology that’s been around for decades. Known as concentrated solar power or thermal solar power, it uses the Sun’s energy to heat materials that are good at storing  or transporting thermal energy. In cases where that thermal energy is stored for an extended period of time, those materials tend to be derived from or resemble rocks — hence the technology’s nickname of “rocks in a box.”\nEach P3 device consists of a metal box topped with lenses that focus the sunlight into a tight beam. That beam then heats a special brick inside the shipping container. A fan blows air over the brick to carry the heat to another box which contains a Stirling engine (a piston-driven device that converts heat to mechanical energy) and a generator. To store more power, developers would install more P3 boxes. “Everything is designed to be extremely simple,” Happi said.\nEach thermal battery can retain heat for up to five days, ensuring continuous operation, and Exowatt will string several together to feed a single generator unit. How many depends on how quickly and how much electricity a customer wants to generate. The system’s efficiency is on par with photovoltaic solar panels, and slightly better than PV paired with lithium-ion batteries, Happi said.\nOther companies have built various approaches to the same technology, though most have failed to compete with photovoltaic solar and lithium-ion batteries, both of which have surprised experts with how quickly they’ve come down in cost.\nHappi argued that the P3’s small size and Exowatt’s iterative approach sets it apart. There are just over 100 solar thermal or concentrated solar power projects that are planned, built, or decommissioned around the world, he said. “If you compare that to the fact that we produce 1.5 billion solar panels per year, you can see the learning curve effects are very, very far apart from each other. \n“What Exowatt is about is taking a modular system that we know in principle works, and really scaling the manufacturing of that and then applying the learning curves of manufacturing.”\nExowatt is unlikely to be cost effective everywhere, and the number of P3 units needed to power a data center could require massive amounts of land. Plus, it works best in the sunniest regions, which could limit its broader impact. \nBut Happi counters that there’s a “high overlap” between where Exowatt’s P3 excels and where new data centers are being built. “We’re not running short of any projects to do,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Bajaj also co-founded Verily, a biotech startup owned by Alphabet, and is the co-founder of Foresite Labs, an AI-focused affiliate of investment firm Foresite Capital, though the report notes he recently left the firm to start Prometheus, the report said.\nBezos would be returning to operations for the first time since he stepped away from Amazon in 2021.\nAccording to the NYT, the startup is going to build AI products for engineering and manufacturing in various fields like computers, aerospace, and automobiles. Project Prometheus is focused on “AI for the physical economy,” per its LinkedIn page, and the report noted that its work will resemble that of Periodic Labs, which is building technology to speed up scientific research by simulating the physical world to train AI models.\nThe company already has almost 100 staff, including researchers from AI firms like Meta, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, the report said.\nAmazon and Bajaj did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

Every few months, Ramp has raised another large sum at another giant new valuation. On Monday, the fintech announced it had raised $300 million led by Lightspeed, which also included an employee tender offer.\nThis is just a few months after a $500 million Series E-2 at a $22.5 billion valuation led by Iconiq, announced on July 30. That round was just a few weeks after a $200 million Series E at a $16 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, announced in mid-June. And that Series E was just three months after a $150 million secondary share sale at a $13 billion valuation in March.  \nIn April 2024, Ramp had raised a $150 million Series D co-led by Khosla and Founders Fund at a $7.65 billion valuation. \nWith Monday’s round, Ramp has raised $2.3 billion in total equity financing, it says. And in 2025 alone, the company leapt from being worth $13 billion to $32 billion. \nRamp in October said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, meaning it was on a trajectory to bring in that much on a 12-month basis. \nRamp today offers corporate expense management. While it has an AI story to tell — automating some approvals and processes via agentic offerings — it is not an AI company per se. It offers corporate credit cards, expense management/purchase order software, and corporate travel. The company says it has surpassed 50,000 customers.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Startups\n"

    "body": "\nThree years ago, Luminal co-founder Joe Fioti was working on chip design at Intel when he came to a realization. While he was working on making the best chips he could, the more important bottleneck was in software.\n“You can make the best hardware on earth, but if it’s hard for developers to use, they’re just not going to use it,” he told me.\nNow, he’s started a company that focuses entirely on that problem. On Monday, Luminal announced $5.3 million in seed funding, in a round led by Felicis Ventures with angel investment from Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, and Ben Porterfield. \nFioti’s co-founders, Jake Stevens and Matthew Gunton, come from Apple and Amazon, respectively, and the company was part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch.\nLuminal’s core business is simple: the company sells compute, just like neo-cloud companies like Coreweave or Lambda Labs. But where those companies focus on GPUs, Luminal has focused on optimization techniques that let the company squeeze more compute out of the infrastructure it has. In particular, the company focuses on optimizing the compiler that sits between written code and the GPU hardware — the same developer systems that caused Fioti so many headaches in his previous job.\nAt the moment, the industry’s leading compiler is Nvidia’s CUDA system — an underrated element in the company’s runaway success. But many elements of CUDA are open-source, and Luminal is betting that, with many in the industry still scrambling for GPUs, there will be a lot of value to be gained in building out the rest of the stack.\nIt’s part of a growing cohort of inference-optimization startups, which have grown more valuable as companies look for faster and cheaper ways to run their models. Inference providers like Baseten and Together AI have long specialized in optimization, and smaller companies like Tensormesh and Clarifai are now popping up to focus on more specific technical tricks.\nLuminal and other members of the cohort will face stiff competition from optimization teams at major labs, which have the benefit of optimizing for a single family of models. Working for clients, Luminal has to adapt to whatever model comes their way. But even with the risk of being out-gunned by the hyperscalers, Fioti says the market is growing fast enough that he’s not worried.\n“It is always going to be possible to spend six months hand tuning a model architecture on a given hardware, and you’re probably going to beat any sorts of, any sort of compiler performance,” Fioti says. “But our big bet is that anything short of that, the all-purpose use case is still very economically valuable.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nNetworking giant Cisco has acquired EzDubs, a Y Combinator-backed consumer startup that provides real-time translation services. Cisco announced the acquisition over the weekend, but the company didn’t disclose the size of the deal.\nEzDubs was founded by Padmanabhan Krishnamurthy, Amrutavarsh Kinagi, and Kareem Nassar in 2023. Notably, Nassar had previously worked at Cisco’s Speech AI group before co-founding the startup. The company raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Venture Highway, which was founded by Neeraj Arora, who was previously WhatsApp’s chief business officer. Other investors in EzDubs include Replit CEO Amjad Masad; Replit President Michele Catasta; Qasar Younis, who is CEO of the autonomous vehicle software company Applied Intuition; and Ben Firshman, CEO of the cloud startup Replicate (which was itself acquired by Cloudflare in a deal that was announced on Monday).\nCisco said it plans to integrate EzDubs’ tech into its communication platform, Cisco Collaboration, which spans hardware and software. This means users can get features like live translation in products like Webex video calling and messaging. Cisco’s blog post also indicated that it could make the translation tech — which preserves the speaker’s original voice — available to partners and developers.\n“The EzDubs team will join Cisco Collaboration, working side-by-side with our product, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Together, we will chart a new course for the industry, one where AI doesn’t just support collaboration, but truly empowers it,” Snorre Kjesbu, SVP of Collaboration at Cisco, said in the post.\nCisco didn’t clarify whether all members of EzDubs’ team are joining the company. We have asked the company to clarify and will update the story if we hear back.\nEzDubs is sunsetting its consumer apps, which supported call translations for more than 30 languages, by December 15. \n“From launching the world’s first video dubbing tool that garnered millions of views on X (fka Twitter) to enabling real-time, voice and emotion preserving phone call translation across 30+ languages, this journey has been extraordinary. But what has truly meant the most is the support, feedback, and stories you’ve shared along the way,” the startup said in a blog post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, there have been a few acquisitions in the translation space. This month, Seven Seven Six-backed Palabra AI acquired live communication platform Talo. In July, language localization company TransPerfect acquired Unbabel, a translation startup founded in Portugal.\nEzDubs’ acquisition also raises the question of whether it’s viable to build a translation focused on consumers when there is more money and demand in the enterprise communication market. According to various reports, the translation services market is valued at approximately $40 billion.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The tech giant is expanding availability for its AI-powered “Flight Deals” tool, adding the ability for users to organize travel plans with its “Canvas” tool in AI Mode, and launching agentic booking capabilities to more people.\nGoogle first launched Flight Deals back in August in the U.S., Canada, and India. Now, the company is expanding the AI-powered search tool within Google Flights globally to help people quickly find affordable destinations.\nTo get started, users need to describe where, when, and how they want to travel. Flight Deals will then use AI to display the best bargains available. \nFlight Deals is now rolling out to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including the U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea. The tool is also getting support for more than 60 languages.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the new AI Mode features, Google says users can now use the built-in Canvas tool to create travel plans. Canvas, which first launched as a way to build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel, can now help users plan their upcoming trips.\nUsers need to tell AI mode what type of trip they’re looking for and then select the “Create with Canvas” option. \n“Right away, you’ll get a plan in the Canvas side panel that brings together real-time Search data for flights and hotels, details from Google Maps like photos and reviews and relevant information from sites across the web,” Google explained in a blog post. “You’ll find suggestions that fit your criteria, like hotel comparisons based on pricing and amenities or ideas for restaurants and activities optimized by travel time from where you’re staying.”\nUsers can then ask follow-up questions and get help with tradeoffs, like choosing a hotel that’s closer to a brunch place you want to try but a bit farther from the hiking trails you want to explore.\nImage Credits:Google\nTravel planning with Canvas is available on desktop in the U.S. for users who are opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs.\nAdditionally, Google announced that it’s bringing AI Mode’s agentic capabilities to more people. Earlier this year, Google announced that users who were opted into Labs could now get help with booking restaurant reservations, event tickets, and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Now, the company is making this capability available to all U.S. users. \nUsers can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. AI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from.\nIn the future, Google says it will make it possible to finish booking flights and hotels directly in AI Mode. Users will be able to describe what they’re looking for and then compare different flights or hotels and browse information like schedules, prices, room photos, amenities, and reviews. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSequoia-backed fintech platform Aspora, which lets the Indian diaspora send money back to India, is launching a new feature for users to pay bills. This means non-resident Indians (NRIs) can pay utility bills or recharge their mobile prepaid plans for their family.\nThe startup said that until now, users had to either transfer the money to their Indian accounts or ask someone to handle the bills for them. The other option for them was to use their foreign cards and try and pay bills while facing high charges and payment failures.\nAspora has hooked up to the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), which handles bill payments in India, using Yes Bank’s domestic pipeline. Through this system, it has enabled payment for more than 22,000 billers in India, ranging from electricity providers such as BSES and BESCOM, broadband providers like Jio and Airtel, and loan payments for major banks.\nThe startup said it’s not charging any fees for these payments, and the users get the best exchange rates to pay the bill directly in foreign currency.\n“For millions of Indians living overseas, paying bills in India has always been unnecessarily complex — involving transfers, delays, and double fees. Aspora has now solved this large-scale problem at the tap of a button,” Aspora founder and CEO Parth Garg told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview.\nGarg said bill payments might reduce remittances, but only by 4% to 5% of total transfers. Garg believes giving users the ability to pay bills will create long-term stickiness.\n“Today, the goal for any Neo bank is to try to get more and more transactions on your app. With remittances, people used to use the app once or twice a month. Because of this new bill payment system. The new feature increases velocity on our platform and has our users visit the platform more frequently,” Garg mentioned.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe said Aspora has been testing this feature with a few thousand users for a several weeks now, and it has seen positive results. The startup noted that mobile recharges were a big use case that emerged out of this test. BBPS doesn’t support some categories, like mobile recharge or credit card payments for foreign payers. That is why Apsora has partnered with international mobile recharge company Ding to facilitate these transactions.\nThe feature is available for customers in the U.K., and the company plans to make it available to users in the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) soon.\nIn June, Aspora raised $50 million in Series B funding at a $500 million valuation, led by Sequoia. Other investors Greylock, Hummingbird, Quantum Light Ventures, and Y Combinator also contributed to the round. The company has raised more than $99 million in funding to date. The startup opened up its services in July to NRIs in the U.S. market, which accounts for the top inward remittance market for India, with nearly 28% market share according to the country’s central bank.\nAspora has now reached 800,000 customers, who have done transactions of $4 billion and saved $25 million in transfer fees, according to the company. \nAspora aims to launch NRE (non-resident external) accounts to let users manage foreign income and NRO (non-resident ordinary) accounts to let users manage income earned in India next year.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Monday, a new Model Context Protocol security startup called Runlayer launched out of stealth with $11 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois and Felicis. \nIt was created by third-time founder Andrew Berman (previous companies: baby-monitor maker Nanit and an AI video conferencing tool, Vowel, that sold to Zapier in 2024).\nIn the four months since Runlayer launched its product in stealth, it has signed dozens of customers, including eight unicorns or public companies like Gusto, dbt Labs, Instacart, and Opendoor, it says. It also nabbed David Soria Parra, the lead creator of MCP, as an angel and advisor, Berman tells TechCrunch. (Parra did not respond to our request for comment.) \nParra’s team at Anthropic launched the protocol in November 2024 as an open source project. MCP has since become the de facto standard for allowing AI agents to connect with the data and systems they need to work independently. It allows agents to access data, move it, alter it, and execute business processes without human oversight. \nThe protocol is now supported by every major model maker including OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, as well as thousands of tech and enterprise companies; just to name a few: Atlassian, Asana, Stripe, Block, and others ranging from banks to consumer goods manufacturers. \n“Everyone talks about AI,” Berman, Runlayer’s CEO, told TechCrunch, “but AI is really only as useful as the tools and the resources it has access to.”\nThe problem is, the MCP protocol itself doesn’t include much security out of the box, so many MCP implementations have already been found to be vulnerable in a variety of ways.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe poster children are probably GitHub and Asana. In May, researchers at Invariant Labs discovered a prompt injection vulnerability in MCP servers that allowed them to grab data from private GitHub repositories (ones that shouldn’t have been accessible to the public). Asana discovered and fixed a vulnerability in its MCP server in June that could have exposed customer data. There have since been many more types of attacks found to work on common MCP server setups.  \nAs you might expect, such security issues have given rise to numerous MCP security products, including products from big-name companies like Cloudflare, Docker, and Wiz — as well as a host of startups tackling more specific products. \nThe most common type of MCP security product these days is a gateway, essentially a security layer for identifying the agents and controlling their access to apps. \nRunlayer plans to stand out in this crowded market by being an all-in-one security tool that combines a gateway with features like threat detection that analyzes every MCP request; observability that watched all agentic activity across all MCP servers that IT has permitted; enterprise development where IT can build custom AI automations for enterprise users; and detailed permissions that work with existing identity providers like Okta and Entra. \nLike other competitors, such as open source Obot, Runlayer business users are presented with an Okta-like catalog of the pre-vetted MCP servers that their IT will allow agents to access. Runlayer matches the agents’ app permissions to the human users’ permissions. For instance, some people might have read-only access to financial systems, some write access (the ability to change the data). Others have no access at all.  \nBerman believes Runlayer stands out from the crowd, not just with the breadth of the product, but because of the team’s experience. He founded the startup because, after selling Vowel to Zapier, he became the director of Zapier’s AI, and built one of the first MCP servers, working closely at the time with OpenAI and Anthropic, he said.  \n“What are the problems that we saw with the protocol? One, it was the security risk because it was adopted so quickly,” he said. There were “blind spots” in areas like observability and audits, that make it risky for enterprises to roll out to users.\nSo in August, “we left our jobs. We signed up David Soria Parra, the creator of the spec, and in four months, we’ve signed up eight unicorns,” he said of himself and his co-founders from Zapier Tal Peretz and Vitor Balocco.\nOther advisors and investors in the company, Berman says, include head of security at Cursor Travis McPeak, and founder of Neon Nikita Shamgunov. \n"

    "body": "\nAs U.S. giants like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic race to develop the large language models that underpin their AI products, startups such as Sakana AI, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, and AI21 Labs are carving out their own niche with specialized models designed for specific regions, industries, or unique features.\nIn pursuit of that goal, Tokyo-based Sakana AI has closed a ¥20 billion (approximately $135 million) Series B funding round, which values the company at $2.65 billion post-money, up from a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, CEO David Ha told TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito, and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.\nThe Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital, and In-Q-Tel (IQT).\n“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.\nHa, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.\nLooking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence, and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships, and M&A for long-term global growth.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSakana says it sees strong global demand for sovereign AI solutions that reflect “national cultures and values.” The Japanese startup added that focusing its R&D efforts on AI products after LLMs are trained helps it efficiently build advanced models tailored to Japan, taking a path distinct from the large-scale AI model race.\nThis funding round comes roughly a year after the company’s Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation. Sakana had raised roughly $244 million in total as of March 2025, according to PitchBook, so this round would take that total to about $379 million.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nFacebook creators are getting a new tool to help them protect their work from being ripped off by others. On Monday, Meta introduced Facebook content protection, a mobile tool designed to detect when a creator’s original reels posted to Facebook are being used without their permission.\nIf the creator is alerted that someone else is using their reels, they’ll also have the ability to block the reel’s visibility across both Facebook and Instagram or track the reel’s performance and optionally add attribution links to their work.\nOr they can opt to release their claim on the reel, allowing it to remain visible on Meta’s platforms. \nMeta says the addition of the content protection feature is part of its work to help original creators succeed on Facebook, without being drowned out by copycats. As part of this initiative, Meta said in July it had taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators and had taken action against 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement.\nImage Credits:Meta\nAlthough the new system also works to protect original content that’s posted on Instagram, it requires that creators post their reels to Facebook to have them tracked. This also works if the creator is using the cross-posting option from Instagram to “Share to Facebook.” \nThe move could encourage more creators to share their work on Facebook as a result.\nThe new content protection system is automatically being provided to Facebook creators in its Facebook Content Monetization program who also meet enhanced integrity and originality standards, the company says. In addition, access to the new program is rolling out to creators who use Rights Manager. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nCreators can see if they’re eligible by looking for notifications in their Feed, Professional Dashboard, and profile, or they can check to see if they have access to the tool from their Professional Dashboard, under “Content Protection.” They can also apply for access on Facebook’s website.\nTo work, the tool uses the same matching technology as is currently used by Meta’s Rights Manager for copyright holders. It will also show the percentage match for each match it surfaces, as well as other details, like views, follower count, and monetization status. \nThe company says it’s giving creators control over if and how the system flags matches. For instance, if the creator has given permission to another account to use their content, they can add them to an “allow list” so those duplicate reels aren’t automatically flagged.\nImage Credits:Meta\nCreators can also release their claim on a video on a one-off basis, or, if they choose to track the performance of a reel on another creator’s account, they can opt to add attribution links. These links will add an “original” label to the reel that links back to the creator’s profile, page, or, in some cases, the original reel itself. \nMeta tells us it’s currently running tests for linking back to the original reel, but linking to the page or profile is the default.\nIf they block the reel, its distribution is impacted, but the account that stole the reel doesn’t receive any disciplinary action. This could be because Meta doesn’t want the system abused to target specific accounts. In addition, it says that if creators abuse the system, creators submitting false reports could see restrictions against their own accounts or they could lose access to the tool.\nTracking reels is the default setting, Facebook notes. \nCreators will also be able to dispute instances where another account tries to protect a piece of the creator’s original work. To do so, creators can submit a copyright takedown request through the IP reporting channel. (They can also submit a report if they find a match that the tool didn’t surface, via a “Can’t find a specific match?” option on the content protection overview screen.) \nFor the time being, the new tool is mobile-only, but Meta tells TechCrunch it’s testing adding it to the Professional Dashboard on the desktop. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWith consumers increasingly asking questions of ChatGPT — not Google — product discovery is changing. And the promise to give brands visibility and control over this fast-growing search channel has made Peec AI one of Europe’s hottest startups.\nJust four months after its Seed round led by 20VC, the Berlin-based startup has raised a $21 million Series A led by European VC firm Singular. CEO Marius Meiners declined to disclose the valuation, but said it had tripled and was now above $100 million. \nThis comes after Peec AI grew its annual recurring revenue to more than $4 million in only ten months since its launch, attracting 1,300 companies and agencies to its platform. \nThese customers use Peec AI to monitor how their brands appear in AI-powered searches. But beyond analytics on visibility and ranking, Peec AI also tracks sentiment — and which sources shape these answers. \nThese insights are what make Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) possible — a way for marketing teams to optimize their brand’s presence in AI search results, similar to how SEO works for traditional search engines. With this promise, the startup says it is now adding some 300 customers a month, and its new funding will accelerate this growth while also supporting expansion plans.\nThanks to its new round, which was also backed by Antler, Combination VC, identity.vc, and S20, the startup plans to hire some 40 people in the next six months. These roles are mostly based in Berlin, where Meiners met his two cofounders in Antler’s Winter 2024 cohort: Tobias Siwonia is now Peec AI’s CTO, and Daniel Drabo is its CRO.\nExpanding fast and being visible may be key to winning in an emerging category that could soon become crowded, with competitors already including New York-based Profound and Austrian startup OtterlyAI. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo help attract more talent, the 20-person startup is currently advertising itself on large outdoor ads throughout Germany’s capital city. But beyond its Berlin plans, Meiners told TechCrunch that Peec AI also plans to open a sales-focused office in New York City in the second quarter of next year. \nAs more GEO-focused tools become available, and SEO dashboards add AI tracking capabilities, Peec AI hopes to differentiate itself by offering marketing teams a dashboard that expands in scope while remaining simple to use, despite the fast-changing nature of AI searches.\nInstead of revolving around keywords like SEO tools, Peec AI’s dashboard centers on prompts for which brands would like to show up well in search results. Customers can track up to 25 prompts for €75 per month ($87), increasing to 100 prompts for €169 per month ($196). Both plans offer free trials, unlike its enterprise offering, which starts from €424 per month ($493).\nTo make these insights actionable, the dashboard also suggests actions that can improve visibility and positive sentiment. For instance, its home page suggests that a company that wants to be the answer to a query on “the best CRMs for fast-growing companies” may want to “join r/CRM subreddit discussions” on Reddit.\nThis recommendation also relates to the “source insights” that are at the core of Peec AI and could guide the content strategy of its users. The startup observed that mentions in tier 1 media outlets don’t give more visibility than articles by lesser-known publications whose headlines are closer to the original question — for instance, on “the best healthcare investors in Berlin.” \nCompanies that already use its tools include Axel Springer, Chanel, n8n, ElevenLabs, TUI, and more, as AI searches gain ground across sectors, both for B2C and for B2B searches. However, users also turn to ChatGPT and the like for many other tasks and requests, which means that the startup has to cut through noise behind the scenes.\nTo achieve this, Peec AI bought raw datasets of these requests, but that’s just the beginning. “We have to filter all these out to really get the questions that people ask around brands or purchases and products and services,” Meiners said. \nFor all the simplicity on the outside, that proprietary data pipeline may be the key to Peec AI’s success. This also serves as a reminder that the AI value chain is not only about models and that the AI application layer and underlying data have become a prime territory for European startups, now including Peec AI.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSwedish automaker Volvo has canceled a five-year-old contract with Luminar, the latest escalation in an increasingly ugly brawl between the lidar sensor company and its biggest customer.\nThe fight is happening during an existential moment for Luminar. The company recently defaulted on several of its loans. While it’s working with those lenders on a resolution, Luminar has warned investors it may have to declare bankruptcy.\nTo stave that off, Luminar recently laid off 25% of its staff and is trying to sell itself — or parts of itself — to potential buyers. One of them is Luminar founder Austin Russell, who resigned from the CEO role in May during an ethics inquiry. Luminar is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, recent filings reveal.\n“Volvo Cars has made this decision to limit the company’s supply chain risk exposure and it is a direct result of Luminar’s failure to meet its contractual obligations to Volvo Cars,” the automaker said in a statement to TechCrunch. Luminar did not respond to a request for comment.\nVolvo is not just a Luminar customer. The two companies have spent much of the last decade working together. Volvo invested in Luminar and helped the Florida-based startup get into some of its first production vehicles. \nThe relationship has been mutually beneficial. Luminar’s tech gave Volvo the confidence to dish out big promises about making the roads safer by offering automated driving features. Volvo gave Luminar credibility ahead of a 2020 SPAC merger that made Russell one of the youngest self-made billionaires ever.\nBut Luminar has faced challenges as a public company. It struggled to diversify away from Volvo, and in 2024 cut a fifth of its staff while deciding to outsource manufacturing of its sensors. Then, in May of this year, Russell abruptly resigned as Luminar revealed its board had opened a “code of business conduct and ethics” inquiry. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe fight with Volvo bubbled to the surface on October 31. \nThe company told shareholders in a regulatory filing on that day that Volvo decided to no longer make Luminar’s “Iris” lidar a standard sensor on its EX90 and ES90 vehicles. Volvo also told Luminar that it had “deferred” the decision of whether to include its next-generation “Halo” sensor in the Swedish automaker’s future vehicles.\nLuminar said in the filing that it had “made a claim against Volvo for significant damages” and “suspended further commitments of Iris” for the automaker. \n“The Company is in discussions with Volvo concerning the dispute; however, there can be no assurance that the dispute will be resolved favorably or at all,” Luminar wrote.\nVolvo told TechCrunch Monday that its “products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars’ powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set — with or without a lidar.” But, it added, the “situation has an effect on some customer orders.” It did not immediately explain whether that meant a delay, or something else.\nVolvo’s decisions were not just a threat to Luminar’s revenue — they also had knock-on effects for Luminar. In the October filing, Luminar said it stopped spending money on Iris sensors for Volvo, and in turn, the supplier that makes the sensors claimed this was a breach of their agreement.\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volvo. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nIf you pay attention to what the biggest tech companies are saying about AI demand, you’ll notice a common thread: they’re running short of compute capacity. That means the large language models underpinning AI products today need even more data centers to be trained and for inferencing, and therefore, they need more power. Against that backdrop, energy efficiency has suddenly become a critical priority for semiconductor manufacturers. \nPowerLattice, a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%. On Monday, the startup emerged from stealth with a $25 million Series A funding round led by Playground Global and Celesta Capital, bringing its total funding to $31 million.\n“This is the hard stuff: How do you get power into the device? There are very few teams and people that can do it,” said Pat Gelsinger, general partner at Playground Global. “We have assembled what I’d argue is the dream team of power delivery.”\nAs the former CEO of Intel, Gelsinger carries significant authority in the semiconductor world, which makes his participation a powerful stamp of approval for PowerLattice.\nIn fact, when the startup’s CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground’s offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger’s fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice’s technology.\nThe startup’s tech sounds simple in concept: a tiny power delivery chiplet that’s designed to bring power closer to the processor, significantly minimizing energy loss.\nTwo years in, PowerLattice has already achieved its first key milestone: Its first batch of chiplets is being produced by TSMC, in partnership with an unnamed manufacturer that is testing the startup’s functionality, Gelsinger said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeyond its initial customer, the startup plans to make its product available for testing by other customers in the first half of 2026. The trials should prove instructive, given that PowerLattice’s potential customer set includes major chip manufacturers Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, as well as specialized AI chip developers, such as Cerberus, Grok, and Playground-backed startups d-Matrix and NextSilicon.\nAlthough every chip company has internal teams working on improving energy efficiency, Gelsinger hopes that PowerLattice’s innovative approach will pique their interest.\n“They may say, ‘I’m going to take some volume to this approach, some volume to my more traditional approach’,” he said. “But we think our ability to capture meaningful share will quickly emerge.”\nPowerLattice is not the only startup attempting to help chip manufacturers address the energy problem. The company would compete most closely with Empower Semiconductor, a startup that raised a $140 million Series D, led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, in September.\nHowever, Gelsinger is certain that PowerLattice’s 50% energy efficiency gain is an “extraordinary” result, and he expects the company to soon raise a much larger funding round to fund production.\n“The idea is bold, the benefits are large, and I expect others will be saying, ‘That’s a great idea. Let me try as well,’” Gelsinger said.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

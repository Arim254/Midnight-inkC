    "body": "\nGeneral Motors is laying off thousands of workers across multiple electric vehicle and battery plants in the U.S., according to multiple outlets.\nAround 1,200 employees at the company’s EV factory in Detroit, Michigan, are being placed on “indefinite layoff.” Further cuts and temporary layoffs are being made at GM’s Ultium Cells battery factories in Ohio and Tennessee. GM will also idle those battery factories starting on January 5, according to the Wall Street Journal, with plans to resume production in the middle of 2026.\nThe job cuts come just a few days after GM announced layoffs to some of its white-collar workforce and announced a $1.6 billion hit as it reworks its electric vehicle plans.\nGM also recently ended its BrightDrop commercial electric van program. The company — and many of its rivals — are pushing EVs less in the United States after the loss of the federal tax credit and the loosening of regulatory restrictions on internal combustion vehicles.\n"

She has been in her current role for about seven months.\nEtsy has faced challenges in growing its business and may be looking to Goyal’s experience leading Depop to help revive growth. In its third quarter ended September 30, the number of active buyers on Etsy fell 5% to 86.6 million from a year earlier. The company experienced a user boycott in July after allowing the sale of merchandise branded with “Alligator Alcatraz” on its site.\nSellers on Etsy declined by 10.9% to 5.5 million in the third quarter, compared to a year earlier. Gross merchandise sales (GMS) for the quarter dropped 2.4% to $2.4 billion.\nIn contrast, Depop performed well, with the number of active sellers rising 40% to 3 million and active buyers increasing 38% to 6.6 million. Depop’s GMS jumped 39.4% to $292.1 million.\nFollowing the news, Etsy’s shares were down nearly 9%.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Commerce\n"

    "body": "\nFubo and Hulu Live TV are officially joining forces.\nAfter some buzz earlier this year about the groundbreaking transaction, it’s now a done deal. The two companies announced on Wednesday that they’ve wrapped up their agreement to combine Fubo’s sports-centric platform with Hulu’s live TV service, following a nod of approval from Fubo shareholders last month.\nThis is a game-changer in the streaming landscape as the new entity becomes the sixth-largest Pay TV provider in the U.S., boasting nearly 6 million subscribers. That puts the newly combined company in direct competition with YouTube TV, which leads with around 10 million subscribers.\nAlthough this deal creates a larger entity and impacts market competition by reducing the number of independent streaming players, sources report that Disney and Fubo have received clearance from the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to proceed with the transaction.\nOne key highlight is the integration of Fubo’s sports offering with Hulu’s comprehensive entertainment library. Together, the platform offers an impressive lineup of over 55,000 live sporting events each year, a significant draw for sports fans. Additionally, Fubo subscribers will have access to a substantial collection of popular shows and movies that were previously unavailable to them. \nAnother benefit of the merger is that it will offer customers more flexible options. The companies plan to offer several plan options, including smaller “skinny” bundles and more “robust” offerings, all at prices the two companies consider competitive.\nHowever, users can still access both platforms separately — Fubo will keep its dedicated app, while Hulu Live TV will remain part of the Hulu platform, included in Disney’s bundle that features Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN Unlimited. \nDisney will hold approximately a 70% interest in the newly combined company, while existing Fubo shareholders will retain around 30%. Additionally, the combined company will have access to a $145 million term loan that Disney has agreed to provide to Fubo in 2026 as part of the transaction.\nThis announcement comes on the heels of intriguing developments regarding Paramount’s interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Reports indicate that Paramount CEO David Ellison wants to discontinue HBO Max as a standalone streaming service and merge its content and user base into Paramount+.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWaymo and Zoox robotaxis are a regular sight on San Francisco streets, and soon Uber, through a partnership with Lucid and Nuro, will descend on the city as well. It is exactly how San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie likes it.\n“I think we should be the testbed for emerging technology and AI and healthcare tech — and all of it,” Lurie said Wednesday on the main stage of TechCrunch Disrupt. “We always have been, and under my leadership, we will continue to lead and lean in.”\nLurie added that he is proud of the success that Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle tech company, has had in the Bay Area. And, he said “we welcome others.”\nLurie was quick to say that safety comes first, adding that autonomous vehicles are regulated at the state level. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. But companies that want to offer and charge for robotaxi rides must also get permits from the California Public Utilities Commission.\nWhile Lurie is opening his arms to autonomous vehicles, other cities are more resistant. Boston, for instance, has considered a ban on autonomous vehicles in the city. \n“Waymo has proven out it is a safe ride,” he said, noting that the robotaxis have attracted tourists who come to the city to take a ride in the driverless vehicles. “We’re hoping it opens at the airport shortly, and can take people here into the city.”\nThat doesn’t mean there won’t be some resistance. For instance, the Teamsters Union has lobbied for restrictions on self-driving trucks in a bid to protect jobs. \nLurie, meanwhile, has taken a bullish view on tech and the money and jobs it can bring to the city. \n“We believe in the future,” he said. “The future starts always in San Francisco, and we’re going to lean into it.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThe 2024 runner-up in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, geCKo Materials, returned to the stage at this year’s show to debut new products as it pushes deeper into commercializing its tech.\nFounder Dr. Capella Kerst revealed four new uses of geCKo’s super-strong dry adhesive: a semiconductor wafer handling tool, a robotic gripper for smooth surfaces (like solar panels or glass), a curved robotic “end effector” for more irregular shapes, and an all-purpose gripper for robotic arms.\nThe geCKo tech is inspired by the way real-life lizards use their feet to grip surfaces. Kerst positions it like a new form of Velcro, but one that leaves no residue, can quickly attach and detach, and requires no electrical charge or suction. A one-inch tile of the material can hold 16 pounds, and the geCKo dry adhesive can attach as many as 120,000 times — and can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or years.\nThe ability to quickly adapt the dry adhesive to existing manufacturing, picking, and other robotic applications has proven popular. Kerst’s company won over Ford, NASA, and Pacific Gas & Electric as customers before she even competed on last year’s Battlefield stage.\n“Has this year flown by as quickly for anybody else as it has for us?” Kerst said on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage on Wednesday. The geCKo CEO said her company has tripled the size of her team since last year’s show and completed an $8 million fundraise. And geCKo’s dry adhesive was used on six space missions in the last year — a testament to the material’s ability to work in multiple environments, including a vacuum, according to Kerst.\nOn stage Wednesday, Kerst showed off a Fanuc robotic arm using six geCKo tiles to quickly grab and move objects around, before showing videos of the other commercialized applications.\nIn one of those videos, Kerst showed geCKo’s material being used to safely move semiconductor wafers faster than current suction or vacuum tech allows.\n“Our customers at TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Kawasaki said we have a goal to [move the wafers] at 2Gs of acceleration,” she said. “We decided to blow them out of the water and do 5.4Gs of acceleration repeatedly, reliably, using geCKo materials.”  \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nBox co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn’t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.\n “Generally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems — just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,” explained Levie.\n“If you’re doing something mission critical — we’ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn’t expect. So you want to have some sort of ‘church and state’ between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.”\nHe painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said. \nIn addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS. \n“The thing that I’m very convinced of is we’ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you’ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,” Levie said.\nAs a result, the typical “per-seat” business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents. \nThese changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes. \nSmaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.\nThis presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.\nHe encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building. \n“We are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is — there’s a complete platform shift happening in tech that’s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,” Levie said.\n“And I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Bending Spoons says it has secured a $2.8 billion debt financing package to support the purchase.\nThe acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year and is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals. \n“AOL is an iconic, beloved business that’s in good health, has stood the test of time, and we believe has unexpressed potential,” said Bending Spoons CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari in a press release.\n“By our estimation, AOL is one of the top ten most-used email providers in the world, with a highly retained customer base counting around 8 million daily and 30 million monthly active users,” he continued. “We intend to invest significantly to help the product and the business flourish. Bending Spoons has never sold an acquired business—we’re confident we’re the right long-term steward for AOL, and look forward to serving its large, loyal customer base for many years to come.”\nThe news doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported earlier this month that Yahoo was in talks to sell AOL to Bending Spoons for around $1.4 billion. \nWednesday’s news signals a new chapter for AOL, which was once one of the most recognized brands on the internet, known for its email service and “You’ve Got Mail” notification. AOL has had several owners over the past decades. It was owned by Time Warner from 2001 to 2009, and then by Verizon Communications from 2015 to 2021.\nThe acquisition marks Bending Spoon’s latest purchase in a string of other American brands like Vimeo, Evernote, Meetup, and more. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nInstead of signing expensive contracts with companies for their data, AI labs these days are trying a new tack: tapping former senior employees from those companies for their industry knowledge, Mercor CEO Brendan Foody said at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 on Tuesday.\nSpeaking on a panel onstage, Foody cast Mercor’s marketplace as one of the main channels connecting the former employees of investment banks, consulting houses, and law firms with AI labs that are looking to automate those industries. Some of Mercor’s customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta.\n“There is an argument that Goldman Sachs doesn’t love the idea of having models that are able to automate their value chain,” said Foody, using the Wall Street giant as an example. “It definitely shifts the competitive dynamics, and that’s part of the reason that the labs need us. Their customers don’t want to give them data to automate large portions of their value chains, so they need to hire contractors who previously worked at those companies, understand those workflows, and are willing to train models to automate them.”\nFoody, the 22-year-old co-founder of Mercor, says his startup pays industry experts up to $200 an hour to fill out forms and write reports for AI training. The company now has tens of thousands of contractors and says it doles out more than $1.5 million to them every day. Still, Foody says the startup remains profitable because AI labs are willing to pay even more for that valuable data.\nIn just under three years since its inception, Mercor has increased its annualized recurring revenue to roughly $500 million, and recently raised funding at a $10 billion valuation.\nIncumbents across the economy have good reason to be resistant to Mercor’s rise, as their industry’s knowledge may be slipping out the back door through former employees on the startup’s marketplace, which could ultimately be used to automate their work. Foody acknowledged he may be exposing an inefficiency in the market but said he wouldn’t call it a “loophole.”\nIn fact, Foody says some companies are already embracing this “new future of work.” He entertained the idea that Mercor’s marketplace could create a new type of gig economy, much like Uber did more than a decade ago. (Earlier this year, Uber’s former chief product officer, Sundeep Jain, joined Mercor as president.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There are companies that are embracing it and realize that the world is going to change very quickly,” said Foody. “There’s definitely another category of companies that are fearful, and worry about being dis-intermediated, and having their customers go directly to the AI labs or application layer platforms. My hunch is that the former category is going to turn out to be on the right side of history.”\nWhile Mercor tries to extract knowledge from various industries, Foody said his startup tries to prevent contractors from committing corporate espionage — the illegal act of stealing proprietary information, trade secrets, or intellectual property from one business and selling it to another.\nBut that’s easier said than done. Most of Mercor’s workforce are former employees of law firms, investment banks, and other industries that are very secretive about their data. Foody said some of Mercor’s contractors still work at their day jobs and just submit data on the side, and he claimed that contractors are instructed not to upload documents from their former workplace. Still, he acknowledged that it’s possible “there are things that happen” given the scale of his startup.\nFoody argues that the knowledge in an employee’s head belongs to the employee, and not their company — a more generous view than many enterprises would take. Plus, in some of Mercor’s job postings, the startup walks the line between requesting an employee’s knowledge and their company’s data.\nFor example, Mercor is currently looking for the CTO or co-founder of a startup who “can authorize access to a substantial, production codebase” for AI evaluations, or potentially AI model training. In an email, Mercor told TechCrunch that a few startup CTOs have taken them up on this offer but declined to disclose details of their contracts.\nMercor was one of the first data startups to recruit highly skilled knowledge workers in the U.S. and pay them large sums to train AI models. Early in the AI boom, data vendors like Scale AI hired contractors in third-world countries to do fairly simple labeling jobs. Now, most of Mercor’s competitors — including Surge and Scale AI — have caught on that AI labs need experts to improve their AI models. Many data vendors have also started training “environments” to improve AI agents’ ability to complete real-world tasks.\nMercor has clearly benefited from Scale AI’s misfortunes: Many AI labs stopped working with Scale AI after Meta made a large investment in the startup and hired its CEO. In the last year, Mercor has quintupled its value, but it still remains smaller than Surge and Scale AI, which are both valued at upward of $20 billion.\nToday, most of Mercor’s revenue comes from just a few AI labs, but Foody says the startup plans to partner with other industries in the future. He believes companies in law, finance, and medicine will want help leveraging their data to train AI agents — something Mercor specializes in.\n“Over time, ChatGPT will be better than the best consulting firm, better than the best investment bank, and better than the best law firm,” said Foody. “That’s going to transform the economy radically, which will be a broadly positive force that helps to create abundance for everyone.”\n"

    "description": "Prosecutors confirmed Peter Williams, the former Trenchant boss, sold eight exploits to a Russian buyer. TechCrunch exclusively reported that the Trenchant division was investigating a leak of its hacking tools, after another employee was accused of involvement.",
    "body": "\nPeter Williams, the former general manager at defense contractor L3Harris, has pleaded guilty to selling surveillance technology to a Russian broker that buys “cyber tools,” the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Wednesday. \n“The material, stolen over a three-year period from the U.S. defense contractor where he worked, was comprised of national-security focused software that included at least eight sensitive and protected cyber-exploit components,” read the DOJ’s press release on Wednesday. “Those components were meant to be sold exclusively to the U.S. government and select allies.”\nTechCrunch previously exclusively reported, citing four former Trenchant employees, that the company was investigating a leak of its hacking tools. Prosecutors now say Williams exploited his access to the company’s “secure network to steal the cyber exploit components.”\nWilliams headed Trenchant, the division at L3Harris that develops spyware, exploits, and zero-days — security vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to its maker. Trenchant sells its surveillance tech to government customers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Trenchant was founded after L3Harris in 2019 acquired two Australian sister startups, Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, which developed and sold zero-days to the Five Eyes alliance of countries. \nThe DOJ said Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resides in Washington, D.C., sold exploits to the unnamed Russian broker, who promised Williams millions of dollars in cryptocurrency in exchange. The former Trenchant general manager allegedly signed contracts with the broker that stipulated an initial payment for the exploits, and periodic payments “for follow-on” support. \nProsecutors did not name the Russian broker Williams sold to, but said that the broker publicly bills itself as a reseller of exploits to several customers, including the Russian government. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nU.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Wednesday that the broker whom Williams sold exploits to is part of “the next wave of international arms dealers.” Pirro said Williams’ crimes caused over $35 million in losses to Trenchant. \n“Williams betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software,” said U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “His conduct was deliberate and deceitful, imperiling our national security for the sake of personal gain.”\nL3Harris spokesperson Sara Banda declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch on Wednesday.\nAttorneys for Williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOn October 14, the U.S. government accused Williams, who is known in the industry as “Doogie,” of selling trade secrets to a buyer in Russia, without specifying what those trade secrets were nor what company he stole them from. According to a document filed in mid-October, Williams made $1.3 million for the sale of the exploits. \nWilliams pleaded guilty to two charges of stealing trade secrets, which each can carry a sentence of 10 years in prison. He will be sentenced in January 2026, prosecutors said. \nAccording to Risky Business host and journalist Patrick Gray, Williams is currently under house arrest in the Washington, D.C. area where he lives. Gray said Williams used to work at the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), the country’s top signals intelligence and eavesdropping agency. \nWhen previously reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the ASD would not comment on Williams, citing a law enforcement matter. \nLast week, TechCrunch reported that Williams had fired a Trenchant developer earlier this year who was suspected of stealing Chrome zero-days. The former Trenchant employee told TechCrunch that he never had access to those tools, as he worked on developing iOS zero-days. Other of his former colleagues supported his account.\n“I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn’t guilty. It’s very simple,” the exploit developer told TechCrunch. “I didn’t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.” \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWhen Phia‘s founders Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni decided to build an AI startup, they targeted an area they understood well: online shopping.\nThe founders, who met at Stanford when they were randomly paired up as roommates, understood e-commerce because they had spent hours upon hours trying to find the right items to expand their wardrobe. And AI, they realized, had the potential to help people discover, shop, and buy in new ways. They also realized that capability was a market opportunity.\n“There felt like there was this giant white space for, like, what should we actually buy, and why doesn’t everyone have a personal shopper in their pocket?” said Gates onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 on Tuesday.\nThe startup emerged from a class project where it proved its initial demand. But the service didn’t launch to the public until Phia found the right product-market fit, Kianni says.\nThe tool, available as a browser extension and app, lets shoppers compare prices, including for second-hand items, adding a sustainability factor to the shopping experience.\nPhia says it integrates with more than 150 second-hand platforms, and has over 350 million items in its in-house search database. Kianni pointed out that buying second-hand represents an 80% reduction in carbon footprint, compared with buying new. Plus, it’s cheaper.\nSophia Kianni, Co-Founder, Phia, speaks onstage during day two of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 at Moscone Center on October 28, 2025 in San Francisco, CaliforniaImage Credits:Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch\nKianni said the service also helps users understand the value of what they’re buying. “If you’re looking at a $500 handbag on Phia, you can quickly understand, can you resell that item for $300 or $400? Or, on the contrary, if it’s a fast-fashion piece and you’re buying it for $100 bucks, is it only reselling for $10? Does it immediately depreciate and lose 90% of its value?”\nThe startup is also developing an AI shopping advisor that will help users understand value factors like a good deal, or what an item’s retained value may be, as well as fashion basics like whether the item will fit based on the user’s previous orders and returns. The founders said the sizing insights feature is currently in beta with a small group of users.\nThe founders have used a variety of tactics to attract an audience, including an ambassador program, making their own content about the product’s development, and even starting a podcast. \n“The ability to acquire hundreds of thousands of downloads at a very low cost through the podcast and the various different distribution vehicles has been really important,” said Kianni.\nPlus, Gates said, sharing the realities of building a startup with their audience helped Phia’s potential users connect with the founders and their story.\n“I think there was a bit of an ego death that we had to go through,” Gates said. “At first, it’s like, ‘I want to look good in all of our content.’ But if you want people to engage with it, and you want to make content at the volume that we need to, you need to be able to just pull back the curtain.”\nGates, whose dad is yes, that Gates, acknowledges that she’s come to the startup experience from a position of privilege, but says they don’t necessarily go to him for advice.\n“So, while my dad — I think he’s a genius — he’s not the one shopping on Phia, right? Like, he’s not hunting for the best deal across different sites. He’s not comparing his wish list items for his spring break trip,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nYouTube on Wednesday showed off several new updates aimed at improving its TV user interface. \nKey updates include the introduction of QR codes that let you identify and shop for items in tagged videos, AI-powered upscaling, and improved search.\nThe updates come as the platform focuses on solidifying its position in the living room. YouTube accounted for 12.4% of the total audience time spent watching television, beating media platforms like Disney, Paramount, and Netflix, per a report by Nielsen in April.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nAugmenting its shopping offerings, YouTube is now supporting QR codes in videos where creators can link specific products to their content, enabling viewers to scan the codes with their phones to quickly access product pages. \nThis feature aims to boost revenue, particularly for shopping-related content, which has seen significant viewership — 35 billion hours in the last year alone, according to the company. Additionally, the number of channels earning six figures or more in revenue from TV screens has increased by over 45% in the past year.\nWhile shoppable QR codes are not a new concept — Roku, Peacock, and others have implemented them — YouTube says its functionality aims to help content creators sell their merchandise more effectively by linking directly to their online stores.\nThe platform is also starting to test the ability to showcase products at specific, timed moments within videos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nOther updates focus on improving the overall TV-watching experience. For instance, YouTube is expanding the thumbnail file limit from 2MB to 50MB to support 4K-resolution thumbnails, and it’s also experimenting with larger video uploads with select creators to enable higher-quality videos. \nAn AI-powered feature is being introduced to automatically convert videos uploaded at lower resolutions to full HD, and the company plans to add support for upscaling to 4K resolution in the future. YouTube notes that creators will maintain control over their content and preserve original files, and viewers can still choose to watch in the original resolution.\nThis aims to bring YouTube’s TV viewing experience in line with competitors, but the effectiveness of the technology remains to be seen. Netflix was accused of using AI to upscale older shows, like “A Different World,” but ran into problems that led to distorted faces and generally unsatisfactory results.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nOther new features include immersive previews to help viewers flip through videos, and better content discovery with contextual search — when viewers initiate a search directly from a creator’s channel page, the platform prioritizes videos from that channel at the top of search results instead of showing results from across YouTube. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nGoogle announced this week it is working with NextEra Energy to revive a nuclear power plant in Iowa that had closed in 2020.\nNextEra has been looking for a partner to reopen the reactor for the past year, and it found one in Google, which has been steadily adding zero-carbon energy sources to power its growing data center fleet.\nNeither company disclosed financial terms of the deal.\nThe Duane Arnold Energy Center was shuttered after a summer derecho (major rain storm) damaged a part of the secondary containment system that would prevent the release of radioactive gases.\nThe power plant was originally designed to generate 601 megawatts of electricity, and if the recommissioning goes as planned, the renovated reactor will be capable of cranking out an additional 14 megawatts. \nNextEra is hoping to restart the facility in 2029, and Google has agreed to buy a majority of its power for 25 years. The remainder will be sold to the Central Iowa Power Cooperative on similar terms. The organization currently holds a 20% stake in the Duane Arnold power plant, though NextEra said it has agreements to buy out both the co-op and the other minority owner.\nNuclear power has been experiencing a revival as tech companies and data center developers have been searching for new sources of power as demand for electricity has awakened after a decade-plus slumber.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Iowa reactor isn’t the first to be brought back from the dead. Last year, Microsoft said it would work with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island that was shut down in 2019. Constellation said it expects the effort to cost $1.6 billion. If all goes as planned, the 835-megawatt reactor should come online in 2028.\nRestarting reactors is considered a shortcut to bringing new nuclear capacity to the grid, likely shaving years off the time it would take to build a new power plant. But they’re still yearslong projects, locking them in competition with new natural gas power plants, which also take years to develop.\nIn the meantime, companies like Google are also turning to solar and batteries, which can be deployed in months rather than years, dramatically reducing the time it takes to power a new data center.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The company on Tuesday also said it had invested $1 billion in Nokia and would use some of its products to “enable communication service providers to launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on NVIDIA platforms.”\nThe milestone comes just three months after Nvidia became the first company to cross the $4 trillion milestone. Its stock has surged more than 50% so far this year, buoyed by seemingly insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPU), which are being used widely in data centers for training large language models, inference, and more. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way.\nMore generally, tech stocks have surged this year on optimism that AI tech stands to revolutionize industries across the world, similar to how the advent of the internet changed business. Over the past year, investors have been encouraged by a spree of multibillion-dollar deals — several of which had Nvidia at the center — to spur the development of data centers and infrastructure to build the compute capacity for resource-intensive AI models. In September, Nvidia announced that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, another beneficiary of the AI boom, in the coming years. Both companies said at the time that they intend to deploy 10GW worth of Nvidia systems to power OpenAI’s systems.\nWith a market cap of $5 trillion, Nvidia is now worth more than the aggregated stock markets of all countries, apart from the United States, China, and Japan.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Using Google’s Gemini AI models, this Siri update will reportedly be the first to live up to the promises Apple made in June 2024, with the ability to complete tasks by accessing user’s personal data and on-screen content.\nAnd that’s ahead of an even bigger upgrade that Apple plans to announce in June, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Gurman says. This version of Siri is supposed to be more conversational, in the style of other chatbots like ChatGPT, and it could run directly on Google’s cloud infrastructure.\nEarlier reports suggested that Apple has been struggling to get its AI strategy back on-track. In fact, Gurman says Apple’s Mike Rockwell told foundation team members over the summer that one of Gurman’s earlier reports was “bulls–t.” But with the Google partnership, as well as the recent departure of Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea, it seems the company has indeed found a new direction.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

To justify dismissing the SEC’s case, the new filing points to a 2024 settlement between New York and Gemini, with investors ultimately receiving “one hundred percent of the crypto assets they had loaned […] through the Gemini Earn program.”\nThis appears to be a larger pattern of leniency from the Trump administration towards the crypto industry. The New York Times previously reported that the SEC has either dismissed, paused, or reduced penalties in more than 60 percent of the crypto lawsuits pending when Trump took office last year. \nGemini has also filed to go public.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n"

    "body": "\nIn recent months, some of the major players in science fiction and popular culture have been taking firmer stances against generative AI.\nSeparate decisions by San Diego Comic-Con and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) illustrate the depth of AI opposition within some creative communities — though they’re certainly not the only ones, with music distribution platform Bandcamp also recently banning generative AI.\nBack in December, when SFWA announced that it was updating its rules for the Nebula Awards. Works written entirely by large language models would not be eligible, while authors who used LLMs “at any point during the writing process” had to disclose that use, allowing award voters to make their own decisions about whether that usage would affect their support.\nAs Jason Sanford reported in his Genre Grapevine newsletter, this change drew immediate backlash for seemingly opening the door to work partly created by LLMs. SFWA’s Board of Directors issued an apology a few days later, writing, “Our approach and wording was wrong and we apologize for the distress and distrust we caused.”\nThe rules were revised yet again, now stating that works that are “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model (LLM) tools are not eligible” for Nebula Awards and that work will be disqualified if LLMs were used at any point in its creation.\nIn a follow-up post, Sanford said he was pleased to see SFWA listen to its members, and he said he refuses to use gen AI in his own fiction writing — “not only because of this theft but also because the tools are not actually creative and defeat the entire point of storytelling.” Still, he wrote that important questions need to be answered about how broadly LLM usage will be defined, especially as “these generative AI products are being forced down everyone’s throats by major corporations.”\n“If you use any online search engines or computer products these days, it’s likely you’re using something powered by or connected with an LLM,” Sanford said. “Because of that, we must be careful that writers who use word processing and research tools with LLM components aren’t unfairly disqualified from awards like the Nebulas or attacked by readers and other writers. “\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe massive annual San Diego Comic-Con faced a similar controversy this month after artists noticed rules allowing AI-generated art to be displayed — but not sold — at the convention’s art show. After artists complained, the rules were quietly changed to say, “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show.”\nWhile Comic-Con’s apology was less public than SFWA, some artists shared emailed responses from art show head Glen Wooten, who apparently said the previous rules had been in place for “a few years” and that they’d been effective as a deterrent, since no one had entered AI-generated art in the show.\n“But the issue is becoming more of a problem, so more strident language is necessary: NO! Plain and simple,” Wooten reportedly said.\nIt’s probably safe to that assume other organizations will be announcing similarly hard-line stances this year — and that these communities will continue debating the larger issues. \n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nHarvey, the high-flying legal AI startup, has acquired Hexus — a two-year-old startup that builds tools for creating product demos, videos, and guides — as the company continues its aggressive expansion amid fierce competition in the legal tech market.\nHexus founder and CEO Sakshi Pratap, who previously held engineering roles at Walmart, Oracle, and Google, tells TechCrunch that her San Francisco-based team has already joined Harvey, while the startup’s India-based engineers will come onboard once Harvey establishes a Bangalore office. Pratap adds that she will lead an engineering team focused on accelerating Harvey’s offerings for in-house legal departments.\n“What we’re bringing to Harvey is deep experience building enterprise AI tools in adjacent problem spaces,” Pratap said. “This expertise helps Harvey move faster in a market that’s becoming increasingly competitive.”\nHexus had raised $1.6 million from Pear VC, Liquid 2 Ventures, and angel investors before the acquisition. While Pratap declined to share deal terms, she said the structure was aligned around “long-term team incentives.”\n\nThe acquisition comes as Harvey looks to cement its position as one of AI’s hottest startups. The company confirmed last fall that it’s now valued at $8 billion after raising $160 million, bringing its funding across 2025 to $760 million. Andreessen Horowitz led that newest round, joined by new investors T. Rowe Price and WndrCo, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Conviction, and angel investor Elad Gil. (It started the year with a $3 billion valuation after Sequoia led a $300 million Series D round in the company.)\nHarvey now claims more than 1,000 clients across 60 countries, including a majority of the top 10 U.S. law firms.\nWhen TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Winston Weinberg in November, he traced Harvey’s origin story back to a cold email sent to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Weinberg, then a first-year associate at O’Melveny & Myers, and co-founder Gabe Pereyra, a researcher who worked at Google DeepMind and Meta and was Weinberg’s roommate at the time, tested GPT-3 on landlord-tenant law questions from Reddit. When they showed the AI-generated answers to attorneys, two out of three said they’d send 86 of 100 responses with zero edits.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“That was the moment when we were like, wow, this entire industry can be transformed by this technology,” Weinberg said.\nThey emailed Altman on July 4, 2022, got on a call that same morning, and landed their first check from the OpenAI Startup Fund shortly after. According to Weinberg, the OpenAI Startup Fund remains Harvey’s second-largest investor.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023.

    "body": "\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.\nThe NTSB is specifically focusing on the more than 20 incidents that have occurred in Austin, Texas, it said in a post on X on Friday.\n“Investigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,” the NTSB said in a statement to TechCrunch. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.\nIt’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation opened a similar probe in October.\nWaymo also issued a software recall last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.\nThe new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.\nThe first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.\nWaymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.\nBut as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on multiple occasions. \n“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sean by emailing sean.okane@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at okane.01 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into HR and payroll startup Deel over allegations that it hired a corporate spy to leak information on its biggest rival, Rippling, reports The Wall Street Journal.\nIn an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Deel says that it is “not aware of any investigation. We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”\nDeel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.\nThis is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.\nTo recap, Rippling sued Deel in May, and revised the suit in June, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie. The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.\nRippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.\nDeel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe spy lived in fear\nThe man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”\nBut the man also went back to court alleging that his family was living in terror because he believed men from Deel were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance.\nPayment to the spy \nRippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, when it obtained bank records. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.\nIn the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.\nRippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.\nSo it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.\nNone of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit a $17.3 billion valuation after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a $16.8 billion valuation in May after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.\n"

That means that across the full-year of 2025, Apple’s market share of shipments rose to a record 9%. This is up from 7% in 2024, Counterpoint Research data shows, making it the iPhone’s strongest year yet in the world’s second-largest smartphone market by volume.  \nThe gains were driven by the iPhone’s product portfolio, growing aspirational demand and wider availability across sales channels, Counterpoint Research’s director for devices and ecosystems, Tarun Pathak, said.\nApple has repeatedly pointed to India as a standout market in recent quarters, with CEO Tim Cook saying the company set an “all-time revenue record in India” on its last earnings call in October. CFO Kevan Parekh also said iPhone’s active install base hit an all-time high in India and the company set a quarterly record for upgraders, highlighting Apple’s push to expand its user base beyond just new buyers, though the company did not disclose detailed figures for India on the call.\nBeyond shipments, Apple has been widening its footprint in India by ramping up local manufacturing and broadening its retail reach. Last month, the company opened its fifth Apple Store in the country — its first in Noida — as part of a broader retail expansion that began in 2023.\nApple is also sharpening its services pitch in India. Earlier this month, it introduced Apple Creator Studio — a subscription bundle of creative apps such as Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro — priced at ₹399 a month ($4.35) in India. That’s around 66% cheaper than the $12.99 a month it charges in the U.S., underscoring how the company is tailoring pricing to deepen its reach in the country.\nThat strong iPhone year came against a market that has largely stopped growing. India is set to log its fourth straight year at about the same shipment level of 152 million units, Counterpoint estimates, with the October–December quarter down 8–10% year-over-year despite the festive season.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLonger replacement cycles, fewer feature phone users upgrading to smartphones, and the growing popularity of refurbished devices are among the key reasons the market has struggled to grow, Pathak told TechCrunch.\nEven as overall shipments stagnated, India’s premium segment continued to expand. Smartphones priced above ₹30,000 (around $327) grew 15% year-over-year in 2025 and accounted for a record 23% of total shipments — the highest share ever — according to Counterpoint.\nThat shift has helped brands with stronger premium portfolios, including Apple, gain ground even as the mass market slowed.\nBy volume, China’s Vivo led India’s smartphone market in 2025 with a 23% share of shipments, per Counterpoint, followed by Samsung at 15% and Xiaomi at 13%.\nApple remained outside India’s top three by shipments despite its record year, underlining how the market is still dominated by mass-market Android brands even as premium devices take a growing share.\nCounterpoint expects India’s smartphone market to slip about 2% in 2026, warning that rising memory prices could squeeze demand in the sub-₹15,000 (under-$170) segment and force phone makers to cut cashback offers, trim specifications or raise prices. Even so, average selling prices are forecast to rise 5% in 2026 after a 9% increase in 2025, suggesting the premiumization trend is set to continue.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "description": "Sparkli said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. The company wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning \"expedition.\"",
    "body": "\nBig Tech companies and upcoming startups want to use generative AI to build software and hardware for kids. A lot of those experiences are limited to text or voice, and kids might not find that captivating. Three former Google employees want to get over that hurdle with their generative AI-powered interactive app, Sparkli.\nSparkli was founded last year by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang. As parents, Poojary and Kang were not able to satisfy their children’s curiosity or give engaging answers to their questions.\n“Kids, by definition, are very curious, and my son would ask me questions about how cars work or how it rains. My approach was to use ChatGPT or Gemini to explain these concepts to a six-year-old, but that is still a wall of text. What kids want is an interactive experience. This was our core process behind founding Sparkli,” Poojary told TechCrunch over a call.\nImage Credits:Sparkli\nPrior to launching Sparkli, Poojary and Kang co-founded a travel aggregator called Touring Bird and a video-focused social commerce app, Shoploop, at Google’s Area 120, the company’s internal startup incubator. Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.\n“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”\nThe startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”\nThe app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Sparkli\nPoojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further. \nThe startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.\nOne of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.\nThe company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.\n\n\n\nSparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.\n“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.\nWhile the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026. \nThe company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.\n“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.\nThis post was first published on January 22, 2026.\n"

    "body": "\nYann LeCun’s new venture, AMI Labs, has drawn intense attention since the AI scientist left Meta to found it. This week, the startup finally confirmed what it’s building — and several key details have been hiding in plain sight.\nOn its newly launched website, the startup disclosed its plans to develop “world models” in order to “build intelligent systems that understand the real world.” The focus on world models was already hinted at by AMI’s name, which stands for Advanced Machine Intelligence, but it has now officially joined the ranks of the hottest AI research startups.\nBuilding foundational models that bridge AI and the real world has become one of the field’s most exciting pursuits, attracting top scientists and deep-pocketed investors alike — product or no product.\nWorld Labs, a direct rival founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, became a unicorn shortly after coming out of stealth. After launching its first product, Marble, which generates physically sound 3D worlds, World Labs is now reportedly in talks to raise fresh funding at a valuation of $5 billion. \nThere’s little doubt that VCs would be equally eager to invest in LeCun, adding credibility to rumors that AMI Labs might be raising funding at a $3.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, VCs in talks with the startup include Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital, to which LeCun is an advisor. Other potential investors reportedly include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital. \nRegardless of who writes the checks, investors may want to note an important detail: As LeCun has made clear, he is AMI’s executive chairman, not its CEO. Instead, that role belongs to Alex LeBrun, previously co-founder and CEO at Nabla, a health AI startup with offices in Paris and New York.\nLeBrun’s transition from Nabla to AMI is part of a partnership announced last December by Nabla, which develops AI assistants for clinical care and to which LeCun has been an advisor. In exchange for “privileged access” to AMI’s world models, Nabla’s board supported LeBrun’s shift from CEO to chief AI scientist and chairman, clearing the way for his new role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs AMI Labs’ CEO, LeBrun will be surrounded by familiar faces. After Facebook acquired his previous startup, Wit.ai, the serial entrepreneur and AI engineer worked under LeCun’s leadership at Meta’s AI research laboratory, FAIR. According to reports, the duo will also be joined by Laurent Solly, who stepped down as Meta’s vice president for Europe last December.\nThe talent overlap between AMI and Meta likely won’t stop there. LeCun told the MIT Technology Review that his former employer could well be AMI’s first client. But he has also been publicly critical of some of Meta’s strategic choices made under Mark Zuckerberg’s direction. More broadly, the Review interprets AMI Labs as a contrarian bet against large language models (LLMs).\nThe limitations of LLMs that LeCun has pointed out include hallucinations, which are a serious concern in contexts like medicine, as LeBrun also knows firsthand. AMI Labs’ CEO told Forbes that a big reason he took the role was the prospect of applying its world models to healthcare. But the startup will also target other high-stakes applied fields.\n“AMI Labs will advance AI research and develop applications where reliability, controllability, and safety really matter, especially for industrial process control, automation, wearable devices, robotics, healthcare, and beyond,” it wrote in its mission statement. “We share one belief: real intelligence does not start in language. It starts in the world.”\nUnlike generative approaches, which LeCun and his team see as poorly suited for unpredictable data such as sensor input, the startup promises that its AI systems will not only understand the real world, but also have persistent memory, the ability to reason and plan, and be controllable and safe.\nThe startup plans to license its technology to industry partners for real-life applications, but says it also plans to contribute to building the future of AI “with the global academic research community via open publications and open source.” LeCun said he plans to keep his professor position at NYU, where he teaches one class per year and supervises PhD and postdoctoral students.\nThis means that the French-born researcher will remain based in New York, but he told the MIT Technology Review that AMI Labs “is going to be a global company [that’s] headquartered in Paris.” The news was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who expressed his pride that LeCun, who is also a Turing Prize winner, chose Paris. “We will do everything we can to ensure his success from France,” he said.\nThe startup will also have offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, but its decision to pick Paris for its headquarters will help consolidate Paris’ reputation as an AI hub, where it will join the ranks of H, Mistral AI and several international labs, including FAIR. It’s fitting, perhaps, that AMI is pronounced a-mee — like “ami” in French, which means “friend,” LeCun has pointed out.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nAI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time. \nHumans&, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised a $480 million seed round to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “AI for empowering humans” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.\n“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch. \nHumans&’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.\nThe three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans& still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think Slack) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications. \n“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans& and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools. \n“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nZelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly. \nPart of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans& doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans& is designing the product in conjunction with the model.\n“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said. \nWhat is clear, though, is that humans& isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer. \nAI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a $43 million round at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings. \n“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman wrote on social media. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”\nThat’s the space where humans& wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.\nTo get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained. \n“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans& co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).\nLong-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in recent academic work as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps. \n“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said. \nDespite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute. \nThe top risk, though, is that humans& isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. \nCrucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans& a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&A is certainly a risk. \nHumans& told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired. \n“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”\nThis post was original published on January 22, 2026.\n"

    "body": "\nWe’re in a unique moment for AI companies building their own foundation model. \nFirst, there is a whole generation of industry veterans who made their name at major tech companies and are now going solo. You also have legendary researchers with immense experience but ambiguous commercial aspirations. There’s a clear chance that at least some of these new labs will become OpenAI-sized behemoths, but there’s also room for them to putter around doing interesting research without worrying too much about commercialization.\nThe end result? It’s getting hard to tell who is actually trying to make money. \nTo make things simpler, I’m proposing a kind of sliding scale for any company making a foundation model. It’s a five-level scale where it doesn’t matter if you’re actually making money – only if you’re trying to. The idea here is to measure ambition, not success. \nThink of it in these terms: \n\nLevel 5: We are already making millions of dollars every day, thank you very much. \nLevel 4: We have a detailed multi-stage plan to become the richest human beings on Earth. \nLevel 3: We have many promising product ideas, which will be revealed in the fullness of time. \nLevel 2: We have the outlines of a concept of a plan. \nLevel 1: True wealth is when you love yourself. \n\nThe big names are all at Level 5: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and so on. The scale gets more interesting with the new generation of labs launching now, with big dreams but ambitions that can be harder to read. \nCrucially, the people involved in these labs can generally choose whatever level they want. There’s so much money in AI right now that no one is going to interrogate them for a business plan. Even if the lab is just a research project, investors will count themselves happy to be involved. If you aren’t particularly motivated to become a billionaire, you might well live a happier life at Level 2 than at Level 5. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe problems arise because it isn’t always clear where an AI lab lands on the scale — and a lot of the AI industry’s current drama comes from that confusion. Much of the anxiety over OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit came because the lab spent years at Level 1, then jumped to Level 5 almost overnight. On the other side, you might argue that Meta’s early AI research was firmly at Level 2, when what the company really wanted was Level 4. \nWith that in mind, here’s a quick rundown of four of the biggest contemporary AI labs, and how they measure up on the scale. \nHumans& \nHumans& was the big AI news this week, and part of the inspiration for coming up with this whole scale. The founders have a compelling pitch for the next generation of AI models, with scaling laws giving way to an emphasis on communication and coordination tools.  \nBut for all the glowing press, Humans& has been coy about how that would translate into actual monetizable products. It seems it does want to build products; the team just won’t commit to anything specific. The most they’ve said is that they will be building some kind of AI workplace tool, replacing products like Slack, Jira and Google Docs but also redefining how these other tools work at a fundamental level. Workplace software for a post-software workplace! \nIt’s my job to know what this stuff means, and I’m still pretty confused about that last part. But it is just specific enough that I think we can put them at Level 3. \nThinking Machines Lab \nThis is a very hard one to rate! Generally, if you have a former CTO and project lead for ChatGPT raising a $2 billion seed round, you have to assume there is a pretty specific roadmap. Mira Murati does not strike me as someone who jumps in without a plan, so coming into 2026, I would have felt good putting TML at Level 4. \nBut then the last two weeks happened. The departure of CTO and co-founder Barret Zoph has gotten most of the headlines, due in part to the special circumstances involved. But at least five other employees left with Zoph, many citing concerns about the direction of the company. Just one year in, nearly half the executives on TML’s founding team are no longer working there. One way to read events is that they thought they had a solid plan to become a world-class AI lab, only to find the plan wasn’t as solid as they thought. Or in terms of the scale, they wanted a Level 4 lab but realized they were at Level 2 or 3. \nThere still isn’t quite enough evidence to justify a downgrade, but it’s getting close. \nWorld Labs \nFei-Fei Li is one of the most respected names in AI research, best known for establishing the ImageNet challenge that kickstarted contemporary deep learning techniques. She currently holds a Sequoia-endowed chair at Stanford, where she co-directs two different AI labs. I won’t bore you by going through all the different honors and academy positions, but it’s enough to say that if she wanted, she could spend the rest of her life just receiving awards and being told how great she is. Her book is pretty good too! \nSo in 2024, when Li announced she had raised $230 million for a spatial AI company called World Labs, you might think we were operating at Level 2 or lower. \nBut that was over a year ago, which is a long time in the AI world. Since then, World Labs has shipped both a full world-generating model and a commercialized product built on top of it. Over the same period, we’ve seen real signs of demand for world-modeling from both video game and special effects industries — and none of the major labs have built anything that can compete. The result looks an awful lot like a Level 4 company, perhaps soon to graduate to Level 5.\nSafe Superintelligence (SSI) \nFounded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Safe Superintelligence (or SSI) seems like a classic example of a Level 1 startup. Sutskever has gone to great lengths to keep SSI insulated from commercial pressures, to the point of turning down an attempted acquisition from Meta. There are no product cycles and, aside from the still-baking superintelligent foundation model, there doesn’t seem to be any product at all. With this pitch, he raised $3 billion! Sutskever has always been more interested in the science of AI than the business, and every indication is that this is a genuinely scientific project at heart.  \nThat said, the AI world moves fast — and it would be foolish to count SSI out of the commercial realm entirely. On his recent Dwarkesh appearance, Sutskever gave two reasons why SSI might pivot, either “if timelines turned out to be long, which they might” or because “there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world.” In other words, if the research either goes very well or very badly, we might see SSI jump up a few levels in a hurry. \n"

    "body": "\nSunny Sethi, founder of HEN Technologies, doesn’t sound like someone who’s disrupted an industry that has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. His company builds fire nozzles — specifically, nozzles that it says put out fires up to three times faster than earlier products while conserving two-thirds of the water. But Sethi is matter-of-fact about this achievement, more focused on what’s next than what’s already been done. And what’s next sounds a lot bigger than fire nozzles.\nHis path to firefighting doesn’t follow a tidy narrative. After nabbing his PhD at the University of Akron, where he researched surfaces and adhesion, he founded ADAP Nanotech, an outfit that developed a carbon nanotube-based portfolio and won Air Force Research Lab grants. Next, at SunPower, he developed new materials and processes for shingled photovoltaic modules. When he landed next at a company called TE Connectivity, he worked on devices with new adhesive formulations to enable faster manufacturing in the automotive industry.\nThen came a challenge from his wife. The two had moved from Ohio to the East Bay outside San Francisco in 2013. A few years later came the Thomas Fire — the only megafire they’d ever see, they thought. Then came the Camp Fire, then the Napa-Sonoma fires. The breaking point came in 2019. Sethi was traveling during evacuation warnings while his wife was home alone with their then three-year-old daughter, no family nearby, facing a potential evacuation order. “She was really mad at me,” Sethi recalls. “She’s like, ‘Dude, you need to fix this, otherwise you’re not a real scientist.’”\nA background spanning nanotechnology, solar, semiconductors, and automotive had made his thinking “bias free and flexible,” as he puts it. He’d seen so many industries, so many different problems. Why not try to fix the problem?\nIn June 2020, he founded HEN Technologies (for high-efficiency nozzles) in nearby Hayward. With National Science Foundation funding, he conducted computational fluid dynamics research, analyzing how water suppresses fire and how wind affects it. The result: a nozzle that controls droplet size precisely, manages velocity in new ways, and resists wind.\nIn HEN’s comparison video, which Sethi shows me over a Zoom call, the difference is stark. It’s the same flow rate, he says, but HEN’s pattern and velocity control keep the stream coherent while traditional nozzles disperse.\nBut the nozzle is just the beginning — what Sethi calls “the muscle on the ground.” HEN has since expanded into monitors, valves, overhead sprinklers, and pressure devices, and is launching a flow-control device (“Stream IQ”) and discharge control systems this year. According to Sethi, each device contains custom-designed circuit boards with sensors and computing power — 23 different designs that turn dumb hardware into smart, connected equipment, some powered by Nvidia Orion Nano processors. Altogether, says Sethi, HEN has filed 20 patent applications with half a dozen granted so far.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe real innovation is the system these devices create. HEN’s platform uses sensors at the pump to act as a virtual sensor in the nozzle, tracking exactly when it’s on, how much water flows, and what pressure is required. The system captures precisely how much water was used for a given fire, how it was used, which hydrant was tapped, and what the weather conditions were.\nWhy it matters: Fire departments can run out of water otherwise, because there’s no communication between water suppliers and firefighters. It happened in the Palisades Fire. It happened in the Oakland Fire decades earlier. When two engines are connected to one hydrant, pressure variations can mean that one engine suddenly gets nothing as a fire continues to grow. In rural America, water tenders, which are tankers shuttling water from distant sources, face their own logistical nightmares. If they can integrate water usage calculations with their own utility monitoring systems to optimize resource allocation, that’s a giant win.\nSo HEN built a cloud platform with application layers, which Sethi likens to what Adobe did with cloud infrastructure. Think Individual à la carte systems for fire captains, battalion chiefs, and incident commanders. HEN’s system has weather data; it has GPS in all devices. It can warn those on the front lines that the wind is about to shift and they’d better move their engines, or that a particular fire truck is running out of water.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been asking for exactly this kind of system through its NERIS program, which is an initiative to bring predictive analytics to emergency operations. “But you can’t have [predictive analytics] unless you have good quality data,” Sethi notes. “You can’t have good quality data unless you have the right hardware.” \nIf building a predictive analytics platform for emergency response sounds daunting, Sethi says actually selling it is tougher, and he’s proudest of HEN’s traction on that front.\n“The hardest part of building this company is that this market is tough because it’s a B2C play when you think of convincing the customers to buy, but the procurement cycle is B2B,” he explains. “So you have to really make a product that resonates with people — with the end user — but you still have to go through government purchasing cycles, and we have cracked both of those.”\nThe numbers bear this out. HEN launched its first products into the market in the second quarter of 2023, lining up 10 fire departments and generating $200,000 in revenue. Then word started to spread. Revenue hit $1.6 million in 2024, then $5.2 million last year. This year, Hen, which currently has 1,500 fire department customers, is projecting $20 million in revenue. \nHEN has competition, of course. IDEX Corp, a public company, sells hoses, nozzles, and monitors. Software companies like Central Square serve fire departments. A Miami company, First Due, which sells software to public safety agencies, announced a massive $355 million round last August.  But no company is “doing exactly what we are trying to do,” insists Sethi.\nEither way, Sethi says that the constraint isn’t demand — it’s scaling fast enough. HEN serves the Marine Corps, US Army bases, Naval atomic labs, NASA, Abu Dhabi Civil Defense, and ships to 22 countries. It works through 120 distributors and recently qualified for GSA after a year-long vetting process (that’s a federal seal of approval that makes it easier for military and government agencies to buy).\nFire departments buy about 20,000 new engines each year to replace aging equipment in a national fleet of 200,000, so once HEN is qualified, it becomes recurring revenue (is the idea), and because the hardware generates data, revenue continues between purchase cycles.\nHEN’s dual goal has required building a very specific team. Its software lead was formerly a senior director who helped build Adobe’s cloud infrastructure. Other members of HEN’s 50-person team include a former NASA engineer and veterans from Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft. “If you ask me technical questions, I would not be able to answer everything,” Sethi admits with a laugh, “but I have such good teams that [it] has been a blessing.” \nIndeed, it’s the software that hints at where this gets interesting, because while HEN is selling nozzles, it’s amassing something more valuable: data. Highly specific, real-world data about how water behaves under pressure, how flow rates interact with materials, how fire responds to suppression techniques, how physics works in active fire environments.\nIt’s exactly what companies building so-called world models need. These AI systems that construct simulated representations of physical environments to predict future states require real-world, multimodal data from physical systems under extreme conditions. You can’t teach AI about physics through simulations alone. You need what HEN collects with every deployment.\nSethi won’t elaborate, but he knows what he’s sitting on. Companies training robotics and predictive physics engines would pay handsomely for this kind of real-world physics data.\nInvestors see it, too. Last month, HEN closed a $20 million Series A round, plus $2 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. O’Neil Strategic Capital led the financing, with NSFO, Tanas Capital, and z21 Ventures participating. The round brought the company’s total funding to more than $30 million.\nSethi, meanwhile, is already looking ahead. He says the company will return to fundraising in the second quarter of this year. \n"

    "description": "PopWheels realized its battery swapping network could be used for more than food delivery workers who need to charge their e-bikes. Now, its planning for an \"aggressive rollout\" this summer.",
    "body": "\nFood carts are a staple of New York City dining, dispensing everything from dosa and doner kebabs to dogs and dim sum in short order. But no matter how enticing the aroma of a cart’s food, the smelly gas generators that keep the lights on threaten to put customers off their meals.\nCart owners and customers may not have to suck on fumes much longer. A Brooklyn-based startup is testing the use of its e-bike batteries to power food carts, starting with La Chona Mexican on the corner of 30th and Broadway in Manhattan.\n“This really started out as a lark last summer,” David Hammer, co-founder and CEO of PopWheels, told TechCrunch. “I’m an ex-Googler from the early days, and this felt like a classic, old-school 20% project.”\nNormally, PopWheels battery packs are zipping around the city strapped to food delivery bikes. The team soon realized that connecting them to food carts was an avenue worth pursuing.\n“Are e-bike packs the perfect energy type to be powering food carts? Maybe, maybe not,” Hammer said. “I would argue it doesn’t matter. What matters is, can you solve distribution and charging?”\nIf a food cart needs more power, the owner can swap the battery packs midday.Image Credits:PopWheels\nPopWheels currently operates 30 charging cabinets around Manhattan, which serve gig workers riding e-bikes, most of whom use either Arrow or Whizz models. That’s resulted in a “de facto  decentralized fleet,” Hammer said, allowing the company to stock just a few different types of batteries to serve hundreds of customers.\nMany delivery workers ride into Manhattan from the farther reaches of the city. It’s a trip that can burn a significant portion of their charge, and many workers need two batteries to get through a full day. In response, bodegas started offering e-bike charging services, for which delivery workers typically pay $100 per month. When factoring in battery wear and tear, the total cost nears $2,000 per year, Hammer said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We can make the economics work so that we’re actually saving them money right off the bat,” he said. PopWheels charges customers $75 per month for unlimited access to its network, and Hammer said the company has a long waitlist.\nThe startup’s charging cabinets can hold 16 batteries, and PopWheels designed them to swiftly extinguish a battery fire should anything go awry during charging. (The company’s founding mission was to stamp out e-bike fires in New York City, which became a significant problem few years ago.) After building some initial cabinets, the company raised a $2.3 million seed round last year 2025.\nSwap sites are typically small open spaces like parking lots, which PopWheels has retrofit with fences and the necessary electrical connections to support several cabinets. Each cabinet draws about as much electricity as a Level 2 electric vehicle charger, which is to say not that much.\nAs PopWheels e-bike service grew, the startup began studying other opportunities. \n“There was always a little bit of an underlying thesis that there’s something bigger here,” Hammer said. “If you build urban-scale, fire-safe battery swapping infrastructure, you’re creating an infrastructure layer that lots of people are going to want to get on board with.”\nHammer started to think about alternative uses for the batteries after someone sent an article about how New York City was working to decarbonize food carts. That’s when the PopWheels team started running the numbers.\nFood carts, Hammer estimates, probably spend around $10 a day on gas for their generators to keep the lights on. (Most of the cooking is done via propane, which is a separate matter.) That’s about how much PopWheels would charge someone to subscribe to four of its batteries per day. Conveniently, four of its batteries can supply about five kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough to cover the low end of what a typical cart might draw. If they need more juice, Hammer said they can run to a swap station midday.\nAfter realizing the math penciled out, PopWheels built a prototype adapter and trialed it at a small event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard at last year’s New York Climate Week. Since then, the startup has been working with the the non-profit Street Vendor Project to move the idea forward. Last week’s demonstration with La Chona was the first time the batteries powered a food cart for a full day. \n“I had multiple food cart owners come up to me and say, ‘Wait, there’s no noise with this cart. What are you guys doing? Can I get this?’” Hammer said. \n“We are planning to roll this out aggressively starting this summer,” he said. “We think we could be cost neutral with gasoline for a food cart owner while solving all of the quality of life issues.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

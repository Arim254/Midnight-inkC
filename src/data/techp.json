The company said Monday the round was led by Lightspeed.\nRicursive says the system will be able to create its own silicon substrate layer and speed up AI chip improvements. Rinse and repeat to get to AGI, the founders say.\nThe Series A comes just two months since the company formally launched with a seed investment led by Sequoia. It has raised $335 million total, reports The New York Times.\nRicursive was founded by former Google researchers CEO Anna Goldie and CTO Azalia Mirhoseini. Their work on a novel reinforcement learning method for designing chip layouts, called AlphaChip, has been used in four generations of Google’s TPU chip, the startup says.\nDST Global, Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Felicis Ventures, 49 Palms Ventures, and Radical AI are also investors.\nRicursive is not to be confused with the similarly named startup Recursive, reportedly founded by well-known natural language processing neural networks researcher Richard Socher. That Recursive is also in talks to raise a giant round at a $4 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last week. And it is also working on AI systems that improve themselves.\nAnd these two are not the only new startups working on the concept. As TechCrunch previously reported, Naveen Rao’s new AI hardware startup, named Unconventional AI, is also working on an intelligent substrate. In December it raised a $475 million seed round at a $4.5 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures, with participation from Lux Capital and DCVC. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n\n"

TechCrunch reached out to Google for comment.\nAmericans have long suspected that their devices inappropriately spy on them. Those suspicions have led, increasingly, to claims of legal wrongdoing. In 2021, Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle claims its voice assistant, Siri, had recorded their conversations without a prompt from users.\nGoogle, like other tech giants, has faced other privacy-related litigation in recent years.

    "body": "\nA group of YouTubers who are suing tech giants for scraping their videos without permission to train AI models has now added Snap to their list of defendants. The plaintiffs — internet content creators behind a trio of YouTube channels with roughly 6.2 million collective subscribers — allege that Snap has trained its AI systems on their video content for use in AI features like the app’s “Imagine Lens,” which allows users to edit images using text prompts.\nThe plaintiffs earlier filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance over similar matters.\nIn the newly filed proposed class action suit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the YouTubers specifically call out Snap for its use of a large-scale, video-language dataset known as HD-VILA-100M, and others that were designed for only academic and research purposes. To use these datasets for commercial purposes, the plaintiffs claim Snap circumvented YouTube’s technological restrictions, terms of service, and licensing limitations, which prohibit commercial use.\nThe suit is seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged copyright infringement going forward.\nThe case itself is being led by the creators behind the h3h3 YouTube channel, with 5.52 million subscribers, and the smaller golfing channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfholics.\nIt’s now one of many lawsuits pitting content creators against AI model providers, which have included copyright disputes from publishers, authors, newspapers, user-generated content sites, artists, and more. It’s also not the first case to hail from a YouTuber. According to the nonprofit organization Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies.\nIn some cases, like one between Meta and a group of authors, a judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant. In others, like the case between Anthropic and a group of authors, the AI giant has settled with and paid out the plaintiffs to resolve their claims. Many cases are still in active litigation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSnap was asked for comment.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 Game Developers Conference is shaping up to be a little less international this year if commentary on social media platforms like LinkedIn is an indicator. \nMany members of the international games industry have announced they will skip the event, mainly over concerns about safety, tougher U.S. immigration rules, and a stronger immigration and Customs Enforcement presence. Developers, past GDC attendees, and other industry professionals have taken to platforms like LinkedIn to publicly voice their concerns.\nICE activity in numerous U.S. cities as well as the recent fatal shootings in Minneapolis involving ICE agents have compounded concerns. Renee Nicole Good was killed on January 7, and ICU nurse Alex Pretti lost his life on January 24. Many travelers also said they’re worried about unpredictable border checks and safety concerns.\nAs one person put it, “It’s not worth taking the risk of going.” Another chimed in: “The U.S. is just a very problematic location for an international event.”\nGDC, now rebranded as the “GDC Festival of Gaming,” is scheduled to take place in San Francisco from March 9 to 13.\nOthers cited general concerns over safety as well as cost as factors in their decision not to attend. Some indie developers and small studios have said the costs, which include hotel, food, travel, and the ticket price, are just too high.\nIn response to these concerns, GDC president Nina Brown told Mobilegamer.biz, that the “safety of our community is always our top priority.” In a statement, Brown said the GDC works closely with “local officials and legal experts to monitor U.S. policy changes” and to provide the most up-to-date guidance. Brown also advised international attendees to start their visa applications early and consult with their embassies regarding any special requirements.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​Brown also outlined several safety measures, including that GDC offers a 24/7 safety hotline, safety training for event staff, and security escorts upon request. San Francisco’s Safety Community Ambassadors program will also be present, providing additional support to attendees throughout the event.\nTechCrunch has also reached out to GDC for comment and will update this article if the organization responds. \nOn the cost front, GDC has introduced a simpler, more affordable ticketing system to make the event more accessible to smaller developers and indie studios. The new Festival Pass replaces the previous All-Access pass and is 45% cheaper, with pricing starting at $649 and providing access to all main event programming.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nThe London High Court awarded a Saudi satirist and human rights activist more than £3 million ($4.1 million USD) in damages on Monday after finding “compelling evidence” that his phone had been hacked with government-grade spyware.\nGhanem Al-Masarir, a London-based comic whose popular YouTube channel featured videos of him criticizing Saudi Arabia, while earning him millions of viewers, sued the Saudi government in 2019 after claiming his phone was targeted a year earlier with Pegasus, a mobile spyware sold by NSO Group exclusively to governments.\nAl-Masari was also physically assaulted in London in 2018, around the time his phone was targeted. He accused agents working for the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, of staging the attack. Real-world attacks are often used in conjunction with digital surveillance tools like Pegasus, researchers have found.\nThe comic and activist said the attacks on his phone and the physical assault caused deep depression, ending his YouTube career.\nSaudi Arabia rebuffed Al-Masarir’s legal challenge, saying it had state immunity from prosecution, a claim it had successfully argued in an earlier case in which the Saudi leader was accused of orchestrating the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Turkey.\nBut the High Court rejected Saudi’s claim of immunity in Al-Masarir’s legal case, prompting the Kingdom to take no part in the litigation going forward, according to Reuters, which first reported the court ruling.\n“There is a compelling basis for concluding that [al-Masarir’s] iPhones were hacked by Pegasus spyware which resulted in the exfiltration of data from those mobile phones,” wrote Justice Pushpinder Saini in his ruling.\nThe judge said that the hacking was “directed or authorised” by the Saudi government or its agents. Justice Saini also found that the Saudi government was probably responsible for Al-Masarir’s assault.\nIt’s not clear if Saudi Arabia will pay Al-Masarir, or if the government plans to appeal.\nA spokesperson for NSO Group, which makes and sells access to the Pegasus spyware, did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Neither did a spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nClaude users will now be able to call up interactive apps within the chatbot interface, thanks to a new feature announced by Anthropic on Monday.\nIn keeping with Anthropic’s enterprise focus, the launch apps are mostly workplace tools, including Slack, Canva, Figma, Box, and Clay, with a Salesforce implementation expected soon. In each case, the app will enable a logged-in instance of the service that’s accessible to Claude, enabling users to send Slack messages, generate charts, or access cloud files, depending on which apps have been enabled.\n“Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” Anthropic said in a blog post announcing the feature. “Combined with Claude’s intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.”\nThe new feature is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers, but not free users. Eligible users can activate the tools at claude.ai/directory.\nThe system is similar to OpenAI’s Apps system, which launched in October and enables interactive third-party tools. Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched support for apps in November, drawing on work from both companies.\nThe new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with Claude Cowork, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Built on top of Claude Code, Cowork lets users assign multistage tasks that draw on large and open-ended datasets — tasks that would have previously required terminal commands. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company’s Box instance.\nApps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.”\nAgentic systems can be unpredictable, and Anthropic’s own safety documentation for Cowork encourages users to monitor the agent closely and not grant any unnecessary permissions.\n“Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nPeople around the world now spend hours a day on their smartphones. On average, daily smartphone use exceeds three hours, and for many adults, total screen time climbs to six hours or more, according to research. This constant close-up screen exposure has been linked to a growing list of eye-health issues, including dry and irritated eyes, eye fatigue, blurred vision, headaches, and the worsening of nearsightedness, per reports.\nEdenlux, a South Korea–headquartered startup, has developed technology to address eye and ear health issues caused by screen-heavy digital lifestyles.\nThe company’s mission is personal. Edenlux founder and CEO Sungyong Park knows first-hand what it feels like to lose control of your eyesight. While serving as a military physician, Park received a muscle relaxant injection for severe neck stiffness. It triggered a rare side effect: temporary paralysis of the eye muscles responsible for focusing. Doctors told him there was little to do but wait.\nPark didn’t wait. He imported specialized ophthalmic equipment and began retraining his eye muscles himself. Over time, his vision gradually returned. That experience reshaped his understanding of eye health, leading Park, a medical doctor turned entrepreneur, to develop technology to help people protect and restore their vision in a screen-heavy world.\nNow, Edenlux is preparing to launch its second wellness device, Eyeary, a daily visual recovery tool aimed at the U.S. market, with a planned Indiegogo launch around the end of March. Unlike medical devices, Edenlux’s products fall under the FDA’s wellness category, allowing them to be described for vision training and general eye health. (The company opted to launch on Indiegogo rather than seek investor funding, Park said, citing sufficient cash reserves to support operations for several years.)\nThe company’s first product, Otus, launched in 2022 in South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan. The bulky, VR-style device uses lenses to contract and relax the ciliary muscle. Otus has generated $10 million in cumulative revenue, and Edenlux says Eyeary is designed to be faster and easier to use.\n“With Otus, users typically took about 12 months to reduce their dependence on reading glasses. Eyeary could shorten that to around six months,” Park claimed.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nimage credits: edenluxImage Credits:Edenlux\nEyeary is also a design leap, he added. It looks like normal glasses, is lighter and more comfortable and the lens system includes 144 diopter focal points, allowing for finer focus adjustments and more precise eye-muscle training. (Otus has five diopter focal points) The device pairs with a mobile app via Bluetooth, collecting usage data and feeding it to Edenlux’s servers. The company analyzes datasets across age, gender, and vision profiles, using AI to predict improvement timelines and customize training programs.\nProlonged screen time can overwork the ciliary muscle, which controls the lens inside the eye. “When people are young, the muscle is strong enough to focus,” Park said. “But constant smartphone use keeps it contracted, and over time, it can weaken, leading to fatigue and vision problems.”\nEdenlux has developed a suite of products targeting specific eye conditions, including Otus and Eyeary for visual recovery, Tearmore for dry eye, Lux-S for strabismus, Lumia for myopia prevention, and Heary for auditory recovery. Tearmore, Lux-S, Lumia, and Heary are expected to roll out in Asia, Park said.\nPark sees companies like Oura Ring as peers. Both collect human data and provide insights via software, on a subscription model. But while Oura focuses on heart rate and sleep, Edenlux targets vision and hearing health.\nIts target customers include all individuals who regularly use smartphones and earphones. “We aim to address the root causes of eye and hearing problems from digital device overuse,” Park said.\nEdenlux raised $39 million in its Series A round in 2020 and $60 million in Series B funding in 2022. The company recently established a U.S. subsidiary in Dallas, Texas, where its devices will undergo final assembly.\nWhile Edenlux currently develops and manufactures in-house, it’s exploring partnerships with major tech firms like Apple or Samsung, aiming to integrate its vision-protecting technology with smartphones.\nCombining firsthand insight, advanced science, and hardware devices, Edenlux believes that eye health in the digital age is more than a wellness trend – it’s an emerging area in consumer technology.\n"

    "body": "\nIf you want to solve climate change, there are few better places to start than cities. \n“The city is kind of like this beautiful vampire squid that sucks in all the resources,” Jacob Bro, co-founder and partner at 2150, told TechCrunch. “They basically aggregate all the prosperity in the world — 80% of GDP — but also 70% of emissions and all the other resources, all the waste, and all the downsides of the good life.”\nPlenty of investors have raised large funds to tackle climate change in recent years, with many measuring success by returns and carbon reductions. 2150 does the same, but to find fertile ground for investments, it starts by looking at problems and opportunities in cities, specifically.\n“If we look at all the stuff we consume, all the stuff we need to build, to make the urban platform of prosperity operate and thrive, you can identify technologies and the bottlenecks,” Bro said. \nThe climate angle helps give the fund an edge, he said. “Sustainability, if done well, is just better business, right? It’s cheaper, faster, and more independent from geopolitics.”\nThat dual focus has helped 2150 raise a new €210 million second fund from a range of institutional investors and family funds, including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Church Pension Group, the Danish sovereign fund EIFO, Fund of Funds Carbon Equity, Novo Holdings, Islandbridge Capital, Security Trading Oy, and Viessmann Generations Group. The new fund brings the European firm’s assets under management to €500 million.\nIn total, the new fund has 34 limited partners, said Christian Hernandez, co-founder and partner at 2150. “Pretty meaty checks,” he added.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo far, 2150 has invested in seven companies from the new fund, including AtmosZero, which makes industrial heat pumps; GetMobil, an e-waste recycling startup; Metycle, a scrap and recyclable metals marketplace; and MissionZero, a direct air capture startup. Three others have yet to be announced.\nIn total, 2150 is looking to invest in 20 companies in the second fund. Most startups it writes checks to will be raising Series A rounds, and the checks will total around €5 million to €6 million, Hernandez said. Half of the fund will be reserved for follow-on investments.\nThe partners said they’ll be looking for a range of startups, similar to before. Specifically, though, they’re excited by opportunities in data centers and automation, both of which have been spurred by the recent surge in AI. But for them, AI is more than just an opportunity to invest in energy-related companies. \n“The impact there is more societal than it is climate-related,” Hernandez said. “Europe is expected to lose 100 million people between now and 2040 — just people getting older. The Netherlands already has 50% of their population over the age of 50. So what role does industrial automation help with helping those people be productive, but also generating GDP and funding those people’s pensions?” he said.\nBro said the focus on industrial applications was perhaps obvious in hindsight. “Cities are all supplied by large or small industries at the end of the day,” he said.\nThe focus appears to be paying off. 2150’s portfolio companies mitigated one megaton of carbon emissions last year, Hernandez said. “The fact that a small venture capital fund can already get to the megaton-level scale in only four years, that level of impact, along with the commercial traction, makes me feel like we’re doing the right thing.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nAs snowstorms pelted the U.S. on Sunday, TikTok users reported widespread issues with the app, like problems loading comments or unexpected behavior from the For You page algorithm. For some users, the problems continue to persist.\nThe timing of these outages lines up with the long-awaited creation of a separate U.S. TikTok entity last week, which the U.S. government mandated due to concerns about the Chinese government potentially accessing user data via the app’s former parent company, ByteDance. (Now, ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture, while managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX own 15% each.)\nHowever, the TikTok USDS Joint Venture stated in a post on X that these issues were caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.\n“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the company said. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”\n\nSince yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.— TikTok USDS Joint Venture (@tiktokusdsjv) January 26, 2026\n\nAccording to user-reported data from Downdetector, the outage is impacting users across the country.\nTikTok’s reasoning for the glitches is logical, given that more than one million people in the U.S. have been impacted by power outages after the massive storm. But some users are suspicious given how soon the outages occurred after the U.S. joint venture was formally established.\nThe outage also overlaps with ongoing protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where thousands of ICE agents have been deployed since early January in what ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called the “largest immigration operation ever.”\nOn Saturday, border patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, marking ICE’s second murder of a civilian in Minneapolis this month.\nIn the wake of the killing, some TikTok users said they had trouble searching on the app for information about the events in Minneapolis. The app malfunctions then led to panic about the possibility of government censorship. However, TikTok attributes these issues to its concurrent data center outage.\nPeople had also expressed concern over the weekend about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which includes language that allows TikTok to collect data about users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.” However, as TechCrunch reported, some of these disclosures are not new and had appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy prior to the ownership deal’s close, primarily to comply with California’s Consumer Privacy Act.\nWhile the recent TikTok outages and privacy policy changes seem to be run-of-the-mill problems with bad timing, Americans do have reason to be cautious about social media surveillance — especially in times of political unrest.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nTo understand the stance of an unwavering Trump loyalist after a federal border patrol agent shocked the nation this weekend by shooting an American citizen in Minneapolis, look no further than Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois.\nRabois’ public support for Border Patrol’s actions in the killing of Alex Pretti, made via posts on X, was so vehement that Khosla Ventures partner Ethan Choi and firm founder Vinod Khosla both publicly disavowed it.\nRabois argued that Pretti was at fault, writing that the protester was committing a “felony.” One of Rabois’ posts said, “no law enforcement has shot an innocent person. illegals are committing violent crimes every day.” Another said: “he unequivocally attempted to draw his weapon. fuck you.” In another post that discussed citizens’ ability to exercise their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights, the VC weighed in: “yes but interfering w a law enforcement operation is not protected by any of those amendments.”\nAmong other comments, Rabois went on to say he doesn’t believe that the Minneapolis police could be credible sources in an investigation: “i don’t think you should ask any law enforcement in MN. But i am very open to reading views from any other urban jurisdiction.” He instead blamed the city’s police for the situation: “Because the MN police’s refusal to cooperate is exactly what is leading to these treacherous conditions (for everyone).”\nAnd so on.\nX reacted as you might expect. Other Trump supporters cheered Rabois on, while those who condemn ICE’s actions argued with and condemned the investor.\nThe situation spiraled so much that when one person suggested that founders remove Khosla Ventures from their cap tables altogether, Khosla partner Choi piped up to distance himself.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChoi posted: “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at @khoslaventures, at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”\nThen the founder of the firm, Khosla himself, stood by Choi. “I agree with @EthanChoi7. Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck [sic] empowered by a conscious-less administration,” he said in his post on X.\n\nI agree with @EthanChoi7 . Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration. The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society. ICE… https://t.co/ASvjZQB0Gg— Vinod Khosla (@vkhosla) January 26, 2026\n\nUnder normal circumstances, opposing political points of view can be a strength for a VC firm. Whatever anyone thinks of Rabois’ politics, he’s been a very successful investor backing such companies as DoorDash, Affirm, Faire, and Stripe, as well as co-founding Opendoor, among other startups.\nBut sometimes they are internally disruptive. \nSequoia was embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire (whose comments over the weekend on ICE align with Rabois’) remains as an investor at Sequoia. But its leader at the time of the Mamdani controversy, Roelof Botha, stepped down as senior steward in November. Botha was replaced by Alfred Lin and Pat Grady (neither of whom weighed in over the weekend).\nIn this case, the rift between Khosla partners spilled out publicly. But note that Khosla did not directly chastise Rabois. (The company did not respond to our request for comment.)\nWhen Khosla Ventures rehired Rabois in 2024, the firm knew it was bringing in an outspoken, self-proclaimed “contrarian” into its ranks, of the ilk that liked to blame the “woke” and praise President Trump. For Rabois’ part, he knew he would be working for a vocal Trump critic (Vinod Khosla has made his point of view on Trump very clear for years).\nWill there be continued fallout? Perhaps — but only if founders really do start dumping Khosla Ventures from their cap tables.\n"

    "body": "\nElectric bike company Rad Power Bikes has reached a deal to sell itself to a company called Life Electric Vehicles Holdings (or Life EV) for around $13.2 million, a little more than a month after entering the bankruptcy process.\nFlorida-based Life EV bills itself as a “developer, manufacturer, and distributor in the light electric vehicle industry.” It offers a number of electric bikes for sale on its website, although most of them were labeled as “sold out” at the time this article was published.\nA filing to the bankruptcy docket over the weekend shows that five entities participated in an auction on the Rad Power assets on January 22. The first bid came in at $8 million, and parties traded bids until Life Electric Vehicles came away as the winner. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million.\nAnother e-bike company called Retrospec had the second-highest bid of $13 million and is being labeled as the “backup bidder” in case the deal with Life EV falls through. The bids were a steep discount to Rad Power’s peak $1.65 billion valuation, which was reached in October 2021, per PitchBook. The company has raised a total of $329.2 million, according to PitchBook data.\nThe acquisition still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy judge.\nRad Power is not the only company in the micromobility world to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years. Peers like VanMoof and Cake went through restructurings and found new owners. Scooter company Bird also went through the bankruptcy process. \nIt’s not clear what Life EV plans to do with Rad Power; Life EV CEO Robert Provost directed questions to Rad Power. “There is still a process underway and there is an exciting future being planned for Rad Power,” he wrote in a message.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch was unable to reach Rad Power for comment; this article will be updated if the company responds.\nLike many of those peers, Rad Power saw a huge increase in sales during the pandemic but struggled as that momentum dried up.\nThe company went through multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, juggled CEOs, and more recently had trouble with some of its older batteries catching fire. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found 31 reported fires tied to the batteries.\nRad Power told TechCrunch at the time that it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft has announced the launch of its latest chip, the Maia 200, which the company describes as a silicon workhorse designed for scaling AI inference.\nThe 200, which follows the company’s Maia 100 released in 2023, has been technically outfitted to run powerful AI models at faster speeds and with more efficiency, the company has said. Maia comes equipped with over 100 billion transistors, delivering over 10 petaflops in 4-bit precision and approximately 5 petaflops of 8-bit performance — a substantial increase over its predecessor.\nInference refers to the computing process of running a model, in contrast with the compute required to train it. As AI companies mature, inference costs have become an increasingly important part of their overall operating cost, leading to renewed interest in ways to optimize the process.\nMicrosoft is hoping that the Maia 200 can be part of that optimization, making AI businesses run with less disruption and lower power use. “In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,” the company said.\nMicrosoft’s new chip is also part of a growing trend of tech giants turning to self-designed chips as a way to lessen their dependence on Nvidia, whose cutting-edge GPUs have become increasingly pivotal to AI companies’ success. Google, for instance, has its TPU, the tensor processing units — which aren’t sold as chips but as compute power made accessible through its cloud. Then there’s Amazon Trainium, the e-commerce giant’s own AI accelerator chip, which just launched its latest version, the Trainium3, in December. In each case, the TPUs can be used to offload some of the compute that would otherwise be assigned to Nvidia GPUs, lessening the overall hardware cost.\nWith Maia, Microsoft is positioning itself to compete with those alternatives. In its press release Monday, the company noted that Maia delivers 3x the FP4 performance of third-generation Amazon Trainium chips, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\nMicrosoft says that Maia is already hard at work fueling the company’s AI models from its Superintelligence team. It has also been supporting the operations of Copilot, its chatbot. As of Monday, the company said it has invited a variety of parties — including developers, academics, and frontier AI labs — to use its Maia 200 software development kit in their workloads.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nIn the wake of TikTok’s U.S. ownership change last week, some users are seeking out alternative platforms. One app gaining traction is UpScrolled, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.\nUpScrolled blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages.\nThe app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the app’s website. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”\n“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi said in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”\nThe app, available on both iOS and Android, is grappling with a surge of new users but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand.\nAccording to data from the market intelligence provider Appfigures, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads.\nIn total, the app has been downloaded 140,000 times to date, with 75,000 of those being U.S.-based installs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Well, this is new … You showed up so fast our servers tapped out,” the company wrote in a post on X. “Frustrating? Yes. Emotional? Also yes. We’re a tiny team building what Big Tech stopped being. Right now we’re scaling on caffeine to keep up with what YOU started. Bear with us. We’re on it.”\nThe surge comes as TikTok announced last Thursday that it signed a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to form a majority American-owned joint venture to keep the social app operating in the U.S. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new entity, while the venture’s three managing investors — Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX — each hold a 15% stake. Some users worry that TikTok’s new U.S. investors may have political allegiances to Trump.\nFollowing the takeover, some users accused the app of potentially censoring certain political content. This criticism included a handful of high-profile users, including Senator Chris Murphy and singer Billie Eilish, who raised concerns that TikTok was suppressing or limiting posts criticizing ICE. Additionally, some said they were unable to search for information about ongoing protests in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Pretti by border patrol agents.\nHowever, TikTok attributed these issues to an ongoing data center outage, which has been impacting its app’s functionality.\nConcerns also grew when TikTok released an updated privacy policy that allows the app to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. This led to some users encouraging people to delete the app in favor of alternatives, with UpScrolled being one of the popular choices, largely due to its promise to not shadowban anyone and give “every post a fair chance to be seen.”\nUpScrolled isn’t the only app that’s seeing a surge in users following the takeover. Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, says it has now topped over 380,000 sign-ups and is continuing to grow.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale. ",
    "body": "\nIndustrial AI startup CVector built a brain and nervous system for big industry. Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale. \nThe New York-based startup has had some success following its pre-seed funding round last July. Its system is now running with real customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing facilities, and chemical producers. It’s given the duo more concrete examples of what problems they can solve — and money they can save — for their big industry clients.\n“One of the core things we’re witnessing,” he said, is customers “really lack the tool to translate a small action, like turning on and off a valve, [into] did that just save me money?”\nAs a homeowner with bills to pay, it’s a bit unnerving to think about one nondescript valve making such a big difference in the bottom line of a company and its customers. But it’s examples like this that helped CVector reach a new milestone, as it has now closed a $5 million seed round, Zhang and Ruggles told TechCrunch.\nThe financing was led by Powerhouse Ventures and included a mix of venture and strategic backing, with participation from early-stage funds like Fusion Fund and Myriad Venture Partners, as well as Hitachi’s corporate venture arm.\nWith the funding round closed, CVector is talking a bit more about some of its first customers — and just how different they are. \n “The joy of the last, say, six to eight months has been going to the industrial heartland, to all of these places that are just in the middle of nowhere, but have massive production plants that are either reinventing themselves or really transforming how they make decisions,” Zhang said in an interview.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of those customers is a metals processing company based in Iowa called ATEK Metal Technologies, which makes aluminum castings for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, among other things. CVector is doing things like helping spot potential problems that could lead to equipment downtime, monitor the whole plant’s energy efficiency, and keep an eye on commodity prices that impact raw material cost.\n“That is, to me, such a good example where this is really skilled labor, and they will need all the help they can get from for us, from the software side, from technology side, to really help that group of people transform, take the business to the next level so they can keep growing,” Zhang said.\nFinding optimizations in older plants might seem like the most obvious path for a company like CVector. But it has also picked up startups as customers, too, including Ammobia, a materials science startup based in San Francisco that is working to lower the cost of making ammonia. And yet the work CVector is doing for Ammobia is surprisingly similar to what it’s doing for ATEK, Zhang said.\nCVector is also growing. The company is up to 12 people, and it’s locked down its first physical office in the financial district in Manhattan. Zhang said he’s been attracting talent from the worlds of fintech and finance, especially hedge funds. The latter is ripe for recruiting, he said, since the people who work in the hedge fund industry are already pretty focused on using data to gain a financial edge.\n“That’s the core of our sales pitch; it’s what we call ‘operational economics,’” Zhang said. “We position it to sit between the operation of the plant and the actual economics — the margin of how much you’re making money.”\nZhang still sees public utilities as a great place to apply CVector’s technology, though. (That’s where the valve example came from.) And he’s found that even these types of customers have become far more fluent in talking about the kinds of work CVector does.\n“Tyler and I were just talking about how when we first started [the] company almost exactly a year ago, it was still like a taboo to talk about AI in general. There was a 50/50 chance if the customer would embrace AI or just kind of discredit you, right?” he said. “But now, over the especially last six months, everyone is asking for more AI-native solutions, even when sometimes the ROI calculation might not be clear. This kind of adoption craze is real.”\nRuggles said that’s in large part because what CVector does ultimately comes down to one thing: money. And with so much uncertainty in the world, managing costs has only gotten harder.\n“We’re at this time when companies are really intimately worried about their supply chain and the costs and variability there, and being able to kind of layer AI on top [to make an] economic model of a facility, it’s really resonated with a lot of customers, whether it’s old and industrial in the heartland, or whether it’s new energy producers who are trying to do new and novel things,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nObvious Ventures, the firm co-founded by Twitter’s Evan Williams, has raised a fifth fund, and this one, just like its predecessors, comes with a “fun” number: $360,360,360.\n“We invest in the frontiers of math and science and physics, and we like to celebrate math in our fund numbers as well,” James Joaquin (pictured far right), the firm’s co-founder and managing director, told TechCrunch.\nThe firm’s first fund was $123,456,789, and the second was $191,919,191 (a palindromic number that reads the same forward and backwards). The third was $271,828,182 (which mathematicians and engineers instantly recognize as e, or Euler’s number), while the fourth fund, announced in mid-2022, continued the tradition as another palindrome at $355,111,553.\nIf you haven’t guessed it by now, the meaning of Obvious Ventures’ newest fund size is a little less about geeky math and more about the firm’s investing philosophy. Twelve years into its journey, Obvious says the figure represents a full-circle perspective on its three broad focus areas: planetary health, human health, and economic health.\n“We love the metaphor of taking a 360-degree view in each of those areas,” Joaquin said. “You have to be a student of the past to understand what’s worked and what hasn’t worked.”\nWhat’s working for the firm, according to Joaquin, is keeping its fund sizes small enough so that a single investment, if it becomes a durable public company, has the opportunity to return the entire fund. Joaquin likely placed an emphasis on durability in part because one of Obvious Ventures’ initial winners, Beyond Meat, reached a market capitalization of over $14 billion shortly after its 2019 IPO, but had fallen to below a billion by late 2022.   \nStill, Joaquin says the firm has seen meaningful cash distributions to limited partners from all of its core funds, and it boasts several companies with successful public-market exits. In 2015, Obvious Ventures invested in the satellite imagery company Planet Labs, which went public via a SPAC in 2021 and is currently valued at approximately $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, its Series A investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals maintains a market capitalization of over $2 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nObvious is also an early investor in the HR and payroll platform Gusto, which was most recently valued at more than $9 billion in the private market and is widely considered to be on an IPO trajectory.\nIn a venture capital environment where only 17% of firms successfully raise more than three funds, per research from Sapphire Partners, Obvious Ventures’ latest fundraise solidifies the firm as an established VC player.\n“We made it to fund five, which is actually a big deal in the venture landscape,” Joaquin said.\nObvious Ventures may take a playful approach to fund sizes, but its focus on investing in startups that make a positive impact on the world is serious. Joaquin pointed to several investments in each of the firm’s three pillars.\nWithin the planetary health sector, the firm invested in Zanskar, a startup using proprietary data and AI to identify and harness geothermal energy, one of the most cost-effective power sources available. Just last week, Zanskar announced a $115 million Series C. Obvious Ventures, which led the company’s previous round, is particularly excited about the investment. Joaquin noted that the geothermal power harnessed by Zanskar can help fuel energy-hungry AI data centers.\nIn its human health strategy, Obvious Ventures touted its investment in Inceptive, an AI platform for molecule development. Inceptive was founded by Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the primary authors of the seminal “Attention Is All You Need” paper, which introduced the transformer architecture, the breakthrough behind generative AI.\nIn the area of economic health, Joaquin pointed to Dexterity Robotics. The company, which was valued at $1.65 billion last year, builds humanoids to handle “dull, dirty, and dangerous” tasks currently performed by humans in warehouses and factories.\nIn addition to Joaquin, Obvious Ventures has four active investors, including co-founder Vishal Vasishth. (Ev Williams remains a co-founder and an adviser.) The firm intends to make approximately 10 investments annually, with check sizes ranging from $5 million to $12 million for seed and Series A startups.\n"

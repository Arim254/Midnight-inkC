But while app access to ChatGPT is tightly curated, Gemini CLI extensions can be published with no endorsement or participation from Google. Available extensions will be <a href=\"https://geminicli.com/extensions/\" target=\"_blank\">hosted in public repositories on GitHub</a> and installed manually by developers.</p>\n<p>“That open ecosystem is vital to us,” Taylor Mullen, a senior staff engineer on the project, told TechCrunch. “Everything we’re doing is grounded in a fair ecosystem that anyone can participate in.”</p>\n<p>The first available extension was to Google’s own Nanobanana image generator, which was <a href=\"https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana\" target=\"_blank\">posted to GitHub</a> last week. Once installed, the extension allows users to generate images directly from the Gemini CLI terminal.</p>\n<p>Launched in June, Gemini CLI has grown to over one million users, Google says, with usage heavily skewed toward software developers. Notably, Gemini CLI is heavily used in the development and maintenance of its own codebase, closely overseen by product managers, as detailed in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\">a recent TechCrunch interview</a>.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Google’s senior director of product management for developer tools Ryan J. Salva told TechCrunch that the purpose of the new feature was to turn Gemini CLI into “an extensibility platform, a conduit to other tools and instructions that come from elsewhere in your tool chain.”</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>At nearly the same moment as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was expressing surprise over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\">OpenAI’s multibillion-dollar deal</a> with competitor AMD — shortly after his company agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">invest up to $100 billion</a> into the AI model maker — Sam Altman was saying that more such deals are in the works.</p>\n<p>Huang appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/08/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-surprised-amd-gave-away-10-percent-of-the-company-in-clever-openai-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> on Wednesday. When asked if he knew about the AMD deal before it was announced, he answered, “Not really.”  </p>\n<p>As TechCrunch previously reported, OpenAI’s deal with AMD <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/\">is unusual</a>. AMD has agreed to grant OpenAI large tranches of AMD stock — up to 10% of the company over a period of years contingent on factors like increases in stock price. In exchange, OpenAI will use and help develop the chipmaker’s next-generation AI GPUs chips. This makes OpenAI a shareholder in AMD.  </p>\n<p>Nvidia’s deal is the reverse. Nvidia has invested in the AI model-making startup, making it a shareholder in OpenAI. </p>\n<p>While OpenAI has been using Nvidia gear for years through cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle OCI, and CoreWeave, “This is the first time we’re going to sell directly to them,” Huang explained. He added that his company would still continue to supply gear to the cloud makers, too.</p>\n<p>These direct sales, which include AI gear beyond GPUs like systems and networking, are intended to “prepare” OpenAI for the day when it is its own “self-hosted hyperscaler,” Huang said. In other words, when it’s using its own data centers. </p>\n<p>But Huang admits that OpenAI doesn’t “have the money yet” to pay for all of this gear. He estimated that each gigawatt of AI data center will cost OpenAI “$50 to $60 billion,” to cover everything from the land and power to the servers and equipment.   </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So far, in 2025, OpenAI has commissioned 10 gigawatts’ worth of U.S. facilities through its $500 billion Stargate deal with partners Oracle and SoftBank. (Plus, it penned a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle.)</p>\n<p>Its partnership with Nvidia was for at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. Its partnership with AMD was for 6 gigawatts. Plus its “Stargate UK” partnership involves expanding data centers in the U.K., and it has other European commitments. By some estimates, OpenAI has this year <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals\" target=\"_blank\">inked $1 trillion worth of such deals</a>.  </p>\n<p>Similar to the AMD deal, Nvidia’s deal has been criticized for being “circular,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/nvidia-s-massive-openai-deal-fuels-circular-financing-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg reported</a>. The critics say Nvidia is essentially underwriting OpenAI’s purchases, getting the AI startup’s stock for its efforts. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-altman-to-the-world-expect-more\">Altman to the world: Expect more</h2>\n<p>As Huang was dissecting OpenAI’s infrastructure needs on CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s interview with Andreessen Horowitz’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfE1Wun9xkk\" target=\"_blank\">a16z Podcast</a> dropped.</p>\n<p>During the podcast, a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz told Altman that he’s “very impressed by deal structure improvement,” referring to these most recent deals. Andreessen Horowitz is an OpenAI investor, so it would be shocking if he wasn’t impressed. OpenAI has found a way to potentially obtain billions of dollars of equipment on someone else’s dime. Repeatedly. </p>\n<p>When asked about these recent deals, Altman said, “You should expect much more from us in the coming months.” </p>\n<p>Altman sees OpenAI’s future models and upcoming other products as so much more capable, thereby fueling so much more demand, that “we have decided that it is time to go make a very aggressive infrastructure bet,” he explained.  </p>\n<p>The problem is that OpenAI’s revenue today is currently nowhere near a $1 trillion, though it is, by all accounts, growing rapidly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-first-half-revenue-rises-16-about-43-billion-information-reports-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly hitting $4.5 billion</a> in the first half of 2025.</p>\n<p>Yet Altman obviously believes that eventually all of this investment will pay for itself. “I’ve never been more confident in the research road map in front of us and also the economic value that will come from using those [future] models.” </p>\n<p>But, he said, OpenAI can’t get to all of that economic lushness on its own.</p>\n<p>“To make the bet at this scale, we kind of need the whole industry, or big chunk of the industry, to support it. And this is from the level of electrons to model distribution and all the stuff in between, which is a lot. So we’re going to partner with a lot of people,” Altman said, with more deals expected in the coming months.</p>\n<p>So stand by, tech industry. OpenAI is still wheeling and dealing.</p>\n</div>"

Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT’s 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the fairest comparison, however, because ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures says that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT’s launch, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.</p>\n<p>This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora remains an invite-only app, while ChatGPT was more publicly available at launch.

(For instance, the 25-kilowatt battery doubles a single Tesla Powerwall.) The batteries can keep a household powered for as long as 48 hours, according to the company.</p>\n<p>Customers also pay a monthly fee ($19 or $29) and commit to buying electricity from Base Power for three years at 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour plus delivery fees. </p>\n<p>By leasing the batteries, Base Power has lowered a significant hurdle for many homeowners: the upfront cost of home storage batteries.

Instead, they can simply pick up their account and go elsewhere. </p>\n<p>Bounce’s cross-protocol migration tool was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/bounce-launches-a-service-for-moving-accounts-between-bluesky-and-mastodon/\">first introduced</a> in August by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/bridgy-fed-a-project-to-connect-the-open-social-web-is-now-becoming-a-nonprofit/\">nonprofit</a> <a href=\"https://anew.social/\" target=\"_blank\">A New Social</a>, which is developing technologies designed to make the open social web more accessible and functional.</p>\n<p>Today, the open social web includes different underlying technologies, called protocols, like <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, which powers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-mastodon/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/\" target=\"_blank\">Threads</a>, Flipboard, PeerTube, Pixelfed, and others; and the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AT Protocol,</a> which underpins <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluesky</a>, Skylight, and other social apps.</p>\n<p>The two protocols don’t interoperate, which is why bridges — tools that connect different platforms — were introduced. Currently, users can bridge their accounts so others on different networks can follow their content, no matter what service they prefer to use.</p>\n<p>Bounce is built on technology that was first developed for <a href=\"https://fed.brid.gy/\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgy Fed</a>, another tool that connects Mastodon and Bluesky by making users’ profiles on one service visible on the other.</p>\n<p>Originally, the service was able to move a user’s Bluesky account to a bridged account that straddles the two networks and then to the user’s Mastodon account.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Bridgy Fed diagram.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>A New Social</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>With today’s launch, Bounce 2 can now do the reverse: It can move a Mastodon user’s social graph to Bluesky, or merge it into a bridged profile for their existing Bluesky (or ATProto) account.</p>\n<p>Things are a little bit different when moving in this direction, the organization notes. </p>\n<p>When “bouncing” from Bluesky to Mastodon, if the Mastodon account was already bridged, then the user’s follower lists will be merged, not replaced.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Zendesk announced Wednesday at its AI summit a string of LLM-driven products meant to reshape the company’s reliance on human technicians.</p>\n<p>The center of the new features is an autonomous support agent that Zendesk believes will solve 80% of support issues without human intervention. That system will be supplemented by a co-pilot agent, which will assist human technicians with the remaining 20% of issues, as well as an admin-layer agent, a voice-based agent, and an analytics agent.</p>\n<p>According to Shashi Upadhyay, Zendesk’s president of Product, Engineering and AI, the new agents are part of a broader change in the support industry, as AI replaces much of the work that was previously done by humans.</p>\n<p>“The world’s going to shift from software that’s built for human users, to a system where AI actually does most of the work,” Upadhyay told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Independent benchmarks suggest that contemporary AI models are capable of taking on the work. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12045\" target=\"_blank\">TAU-bench</a>, which was designed to measure a model’s tool-calling ability, includes a scenario in which models have to process a returned product — a close analogue to many support tasks. <a href=\"https://llm-stats.com/benchmarks/tau-bench-retail\" target=\"_blank\">The current leader</a>, Claude Sonnet 4.5, solves 85% of issues on the test.</p>\n<p>After <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/18/zendesks-latest-problem-is-an-activist-investor/\">a chaotic investor fight in 2022</a>, Zendesk has made a string of AI acquisitions that laid the groundwork for the current shift. The analytics agent launching today is built directly on the company’s <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/articles/hyperarc-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperarc acquisition</a>, which was completed in July. Earlier AI acquisitions include the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/ai-powered-estonian-qa-startup-klaus-acquired-by-zendesk/\">QA and agentic service system Klaus</a> (acquired in February 2024) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/13/zendesk-adds-flexible-ai-agent-capabilities-with-ultimate-acquisition/\">the automation platform Ultimate</a> (acquired the following March).</p>\n<p>Zendesk has previewed the new system with existing customers, and Upadhyay says the results have been promising.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“For customers that have been using it, consumer satisfaction has been up by five to 10 points,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Large language models have often been deployed for customer support, although rarely at the Zendesk’s scale. Companies from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/\">Airbnb</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/regal-claims-its-customer-service-chatbots-are-better-than-most/\">Regal Theaters</a> have already experimented with in-house chatbot support, often contracting directly with foundation model labs. But those systems typically deal with information retrieval rather than more complex troubleshooting or taking self-directed action.</p>\n<p>If the new push for AI-based support is successful, the economic implications would be significant. Zendesk’s Resolution Platform already supports nearly 20,000 customers, resolving 4.6 billion tickets each year. Beyond Zendesk, the U.S. employs <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/office-and-administrative-support/customer-service-representatives.htm#:~:text=Customer%20service%20representatives%20typically%20use,employed%20in%20nearly%20every%20industry.\" target=\"_blank\">2.4 million customer service representatives</a> — with far larger workforces in other countries.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The first is a fleet of robotic waste bins, called Hoooly, that use generative AI to determine what is trash and what is recycling and sort the waste accordingly. The second is a smart lid that can be fitted to existing waste bins with the same functionality as its larger bin counterpart. </p>\n<p>The company also has a software product that allows companies to track the waste they produce; it offers suggestions for how a company can reduce waste production based on its waste data. </p>\n<p>Ganiga will be showing off its tech as part of this year’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Battlefield</a> competition at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>, which runs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">October 27 to 29</a> at San Francisco’s Moscone West. </p>\n<p>Nicolas Zeoli, the founder and CEO of Ganiga, told TechCrunch that he’s had dreams of building the next great company, like Facebook or Apple, since he was younger. </p>\n<p>He decided to focus on waste because he said issues surrounding waste management are very tangible in his native Italy — and it was clear there wasn’t much being done about it. </p>\n<p>“We all need to reclaim this problem,” Zeoli said. “I read 100 articles on this problem. For example, in one year, only in one year, in the whole world over 100 million tons of plastic is created and only 9% is recycled. This is a very real problem.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Zeoli launched Ganiga in 2021 and built its first prototype in 2022. Zeoli said they decided to focus on building a bin to solve this problem because it gives people a physical place to put waste that can ensure it gets properly recycled and sorted, and because the bins spit out data that can be used for the future. </p>\n<p>Waste management is also expensive for companies, Zeoli said. Many organizations, especially in Europe, have ESG mandates to adhere to. Zeoli hopes Hoooly can help companies better track their waste production to help them reduce waste and waste-related costs down the line.</p>\n<p>Ganiga started selling its bins in 2024 and has since sold more than 120 robots to customers like Google and to multiple airports, including the ones in Bologna, Venice, and Madrid, among others. </p>\n<p>Zeoli said the company made $500,000 in revenue in 2024 and is already up to $750,000 in just the first nine months of 2025. </p>\n<p>The company has also raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding from investors, including clean tech VC firm NextSTEP and NextEnergy Capital, among others. Ganiga is looking to raise a $3 million seed round. </p>\n<p>The company is gearing up to launch its latest product in November, the Hooolyfood, which is a software product that uses camera images to determine the exact amount of food waste. The company plans to delve into further software-focused products in the future, too, Zeoli said, based on the data their current bins and software is collecting. </p>\n<p>Ganiga has focused on the European market thus far, but Zeoli said he’s hoping to expand into the U.S.; the company is even thinking of moving its headquarters stateside in 2026. </p>\n<p>“Ganiga is the first startup in all the world to fill one airport with the smart bins,” Zeoli said. “This is important because we don’t target the prototype; we are a product, and we are open to the market.”</p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn from Ganiga firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches and valuable workshops and make the connections that drive business results, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt</a>, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A few weeks ago, President Trump announced the application fee for an H-1B visa would increase to $100,000. The price tag sent shock waves through the tech ecosystem, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\">heavily utilizes the visa</a> to bring talent in from other countries. </p>\n<p>On this week’s Equity, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/why-the-new-h-1b-policy-helps-outsourcers-not-startups/\">we sat down with</a> Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, to talk about the visa changes, what it means, and why it’s happening. </p>\n<p>He said the intention of the visa change makes sense, but the implementation of it has “left a lot to be desired.”  </p>\n<p>“Some of the proposals that they’ve ended up settling on have either loopholes or they’re prioritizing the wrong thing,” he said. As a result, he said, the visa changes will probably have the reverse effect than what the Trump administration intended. “It’s going to be a big tax on us bringing in top researchers from around the world.” </p>\n<p>But for all the sticker shock, there are a lot of people in support of the visa changes. Neufeld said it makes sense to make sure that the 85,000 open H-1B visa slots are actually going to valuable workers and that it makes sense to charge a fee to ensure that only the best are applying — and receiving the visa. </p>\n<p>He also spoke about the allegations that companies were abusing the visa. But again, he said, there are loopholes in the changes that are hard to ignore. </p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the conversation, we spoke about the other changes made to the visa, such as the required wage levels. We pondered the Trump administration’s reasons for changing the visa and the odds of more changes to the visa occurring before its lottery in the spring. Neufeld also spoke about what impact this will have on the global tech scene and hiring.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“I think many people are going to be deterred from coming to the United States,” he said. </p>\n<p>Overall, there are many uncertainties regarding nearly every aspect of this visa change.

The tech giant also announced the feature now lets users virtually try on shoes.</p>\n<p>The feature works by asking users to upload a photo to see how real clothes might look on them. Now, users can visualize how different pairs of shoes would look on them.</p>\n<p>To virtually try on a pair of shoes, users need to tap on any product listing on Google, select the “Try It On” button, then add a full-length photo of themselves. After a few seconds, they will see the shoes from the listing on a digital version of themselves. Users have the option to save or share the image with others.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?w=652\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png 1478w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=768,801 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=652,680 652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=1150,1200 1150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=1227,1280 1227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=412,430 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=690,720 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=863,900 863w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=767,800 767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=1472,1536 1472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=640,668 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=359,375 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=591,617 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=509,531 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=48,50 48w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The launch comes two months after Google introduced the ability for users to virtually try on clothes using AI.

In June, the tech giant launched an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/google-launches-doppl-a-new-app-that-lets-you-visualize-how-an-outfit-might-look-on-you/\">experimental app called Doppl</a> that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you.</p>\n<p>While both the virtual try-on feature, which now includes shoes, and Doppl are powered by the same generative AI technology, Doppl is designed to let shoppers dive even deeper into virtual try-on, helping them curate their personal style. Plus, Doppl can create AI-generated videos so users can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on them in real life.</p>\n<p>Google isn’t the only company to launch virtual try-on technology, as both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/09/amazon-gets-into-ar-shopping-with-launch-of-virtual-try-on-for-shoes/\">Amazon</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/walmart-introduces-virtual-try-on-tech-which-uses-customers-own-photos-to-model-the-clothing/\">Walmart</a> have introduced similar features.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

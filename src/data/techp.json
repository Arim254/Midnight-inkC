Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.\nInitially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.\nX and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.\nThe U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Social\n\n"

    "body": "\nOpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting. \nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.\nConvogo’s product will be wound down. \nThe startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo. \nIn the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes. \n“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”\nThe Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jonny Ive’s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "description": "If the robots don't always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where their parent companies might be headed.",
    "body": "\nCES has always been a robot extravaganza, and this year’s event saw the announcement of a number of important robotics developments, including the new, production-ready debut of Atlas, the humanoid from Boston Dynamics. Then there were all the robots on the showroom floor, where bots often serve as good marketing for the companies involved. If they don’t always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered.\nThe ping pong player \nThe movie Marty Supreme just came out a month ago, so I guess it’s only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year’s convention. The Chinese robotics firm Sharpa had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm’s staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I’m sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot’s. A Sharpa rep told me that the company’s main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand’s dexterity.\nThe boxer \nOne of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company EngineAI, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox near each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That’s too much like Robocop.”\nThe dancer\nDancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that has been scrutinized for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly run at speeds of up to 11 mph. I didn’t see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree’s booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe convenience store clerk \nI stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot’s booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company’s website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant at Chinese pharmacies. \nThe housekeeper \nCreating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered a fundamental test of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories.\nOne of those businesses, the rep told me, is Monster Laundry, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna’s shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.” \nDyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million Series A fundraising round in September that included funding from Nvidia’s NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung.\nThe butler \nI also stopped by LG’s section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block. You can read my full review of that experience here.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nMeta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S.\nOklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants.\nNuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.\nExisting reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.\nThe deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.\nThe 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.\nAs part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nIf Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.\nTerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours. \nThe company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.\nMeta did not disclose financial terms of the deals. \nThe power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid. \nCosts for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

(X and xAI are part of the same company.)\nIn a statement shared with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”\nThe ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue.\nVaried governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, which could be setting the stage for an investigation.\nIn the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.”\nAnd while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nxAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images.\nIn response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn’t taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\n​XBrew Lab debuted its countertop nitro beverage machine, EverNitro, at CES this week, offering nitro coffee enthusiasts a more accessible way to enjoy the drink — without the waste and expense of traditional cartridge-based machines.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with nitro coffee, it’s cold brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas. This process creates tiny bubbles, resulting in a silky-smooth, naturally sweeter taste — similar to drinking a Guinness. Many people also note that nitro coffee is less bitter.\nEverNitro is positioning itself against competitors such as NitroBrew as a long-term more affordable all-in-one solution. “We offer the quality of a commercial tap with the footprint of a coffee maker. While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said.\n​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use.\nImage Credits:XBREW Lab\nAfter testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised. The machine is simple to use, and it fits easily on a counter or stores comfortably on a shelf — making it a nice addition to any kitchen or bar setup. The canister accommodates coffee, cocktails for that bar-quality touch, or other beverages. Users can select their preferred pressure, which ranges from 0 to 8 BAR (a metric unit of pressure).\nThe entire process, from loading your beverage to enjoying the finished drink, takes only minutes. There’s also a companion app that delivers updates. \nThe device launched on Kickstarter in October and raised over $570,000 — a testament to strong interest in this product despite its premium price point. The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of NitroBrew costs about $1,000.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLooking ahead, Tan told TechCrunch that the team is “exploring how gases can fundamentally elevate the texture of all beverages, not just coffee. Imagine a machine that doesn’t just dispense; it intelligently mixes a cocktail or brews a coffee and then automatically selects the perfect gas profile to enhance its body and mouthfeel.”\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nAI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals. Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant.\nAnthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal.\nThe partnership is made up of three specific initiatives.\nThe first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multistep workflows with a human in the loop.\nThis partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs.\n“With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.”\nThis is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.\nIn October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products.\nThe race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least.\nAnthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.\nGoogle launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.\nOpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.\nA recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.\nWhile Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nA former SandboxAQ executive filed a wrongful termination suit last month filled with such scandalous allegations against the company’s famed CEO, Jack Hidary, that the plaintiff himself redacted the most salacious details. \nOn Friday, the company’s lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.”\nEven the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A copy of the lawsuit is available here.)\nThe case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements.\nThe suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors. \nFor its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company’s lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.”\nWhat makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSandboxAQ was spun out of Alphabet into an independent company in March 2022 with Hidary as CEO and soon attracted big-name investors, including billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who invested and became the startup’s chairman. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio. \nBender’s attorneys say in another court document that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. This is an unusual move — typically, it’s the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations.\nVarious explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn’t ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren’t accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don’t offer an acceptable settlement.\nThe unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes. \nBender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors. \nSandboxAQ’s lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.”\nBender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.”\nWhile the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by The Information in July.  \nSources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company’s revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ’s full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.) \nDespite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia. \nSandboxAQ also announced a $90 million secondary sale. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, it says, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.\n"

    "body": "\nCES is always chock-full of robots, and this year electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOiD, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore).\nCLOiD is described as an AI-powered home robot, designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. The company says that, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.”\nThe bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience.\nCLOiD has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s smart home ThinQ app, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says.\nThe bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOiD runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri).\nThe last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including Amazon’s Astro and Enabot’s EBO X. CLOiD follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOiD has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment.\nYou’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCLOiD was cute, and seemed affable enough, but the biggest thing you notice is how slow it is. During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOiD to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk.\nYes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOiD. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “Zero Labor Home” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least.\nFrom the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.” \nAn on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOiD would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information.\nThus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOiD felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home.\nI got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the return of the LG Wallpaper (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had a variety of appliances on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOiD and are controllable via the company’s ThinQ app.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nFor the past two weeks, X has been flooded with AI-manipulated nude images, created by the Grok AI chatbot. An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders. \nA December 31 research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5-6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. \nBut while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark.\nUnsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok.\nIt’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk.\nIn the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.”\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was submitted to the regulator on January 7, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Some shops in Tehran’s traditional bazaar have been closed for 11 days, according to The New York Times.\nIran’s government has responded by violently cracking down on the protesters.  \nThe Iranian government, which maintains a tight control over the country’s internet access, is behind the internet blackout, according to Rashidi.\nRepresentatives for the Iranian government in the United States did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

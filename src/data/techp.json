Reports about Netflix’s efforts to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/netflix-plans-to-bring-games-to-tv-and-let-players-use-their-iphones-as-video-game-controllers/\">bring its mobile games to televisions</a> began in early 2023. Later that year, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/netflix-launches-a-game-controller-app-for-playing-games-on-your-tv/\">launched a game controller app</a> for iOS devices. </p>\n<p>However, there hadn’t been much word about gaming on the big screen until now, but it looks like the wait is finally over.</p>\n<p>To use the new feature, go to the Games tab on the Netflix TV app, then pick a game and use your phone as the controller.</p>\n<p>Since launching mobile games four years ago, Netflix’s strategy has been somewhat varied. However, the recent move indicates a more serious commitment to expanding its gaming offerings, helping it compete more directly with major video game companies, beyond just mobile gaming rivals.</p>\n<p>Alongside the announcement, Netflix <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> the new slate of games it’s launching, all of which are party titles meant to be played in groups. </p>\n<p>These include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boggle Party</strong>: Up to eight players are timed to find words in a scrambled letter grid.</li>\n<li><strong>LEGO Party!</strong>: Four players compete in minigames and challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends</strong>: One person at this party secretly has no idea what everyone else is talking about. Figure out whose clues are fishy to unmask the crasher. </li>\n<li><strong>Pictionary: Game Night</strong>: Based on the classic group game, friends must guess what you’re drawing before time runs out. </li>\n<li><strong>Tetris Time Warp:</strong> Compete against friends for the best score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Launching group-focused games is a smart move for Netflix because it encourages more customers to participate. It also means users will stay engaged with the streaming service, even when they’re not watching a TV series or movie. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The addition of the five titles follows Netflix’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview\" target=\"_blank\">insight</a> into its current gaming strategy, which will now focus on four types of games, including party titles.</p>\n<p>The games are currently available on select TV screens in specific countries, and Netflix plans to expand their availability over time.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

Days earlier, Oracle’s chief security officer, Rob Duhart, claimed in the same post — since scrubbed — that the extortion campaign was linked to previously identified vulnerabilities that Oracle patched in July, suggesting the hacks were over.</p>\n<p>But in a <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html\" target=\"_blank\">security advisory</a> published over the weekend, Oracle said the zero-day bug — named because Oracle had no time to fix the bug, as it was already being exploited by hackers — can be “exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.” </p>\n<p>The Russia-linked Clop ransomware and extortion gang has made a name for itself in recent years for mass-hacking campaigns, often involving the abuse of vulnerabilities unknown to the software vendor at the time they were exploited, to steal large amounts of corporate and customer data. This includes managed file transfer tools, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/clop-ransomware-gang-names-dozens-of-victims-hit-by-cleo-mass-hack-but-several-firms-dispute-breaches/\">Cleo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers/\">MOVEit</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/intellihartx-data-breach-fortra-ransomware/\">GoAnywhere</a>, which companies use as a way to send sensitive corporate data over the internet.</p>\n<p>Google’s blog post includes email addresses and other technical details that network defenders can use to look for extortion emails and other indications that their Oracle systems may have been compromised.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Design platform <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a> is partnering with Google to add more AI features, the company announced on Thursday. While Figma had previously introduced <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/make/\" target=\"_blank\">AI app-building tools</a> of its own, the new integration with Google will bring several Gemini models to the design software to address what Figma says are the “evolving needs” of product designers and their teams.</p>\n<p>With the partnership, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.0, and Imagen 4 will be added to Figma’s toolset, while the company maintains its relationship with Google Cloud. </p>\n<p>Gemini 2.5 Flash will be integrated into the process for editing images and Figma’s image generation capabilities, allowing the software’s 13 million monthly active users to make AI images with a prompt and request changes. The company believes the addition will speed up workflows, citing earlier tests of Gemini 2.5 Flash in its product, where users experienced a 50% reduction in latency for the company’s “Make Image” feature. </p>\n<p>The partnership is now one of several from top AI makers, intent on integrating their models within existing apps with large user bases as they seek to establish dominance in a tight race for consumer adoption. This week, for instance, OpenAI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">announced</a> that its users could “chat” with apps inside ChatGPT, including those from Spotify, Booking.com, Expedia, Coursera, Zillow, Canva, and others. Figma was also in that list, indicating the Google Gemini deal is not an exclusive one.  </p>\n<p>The news of the Figma deal arrives alongside Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement of Gemini Enterprise</a>, an AI-powered conversational platform designed to bring AI to enterprise customers within their existing workflows. That means users would be able to chat with their company’s documents, data, and applications, and engineers would have access to tools to build and deploy AI agents or use a suite of existing agents.</p>\n<p>Google positioned the news as a win for AI’s potential to increase efficiency and improve workflows — something companies would presumably pay for as they come to rely on the integrations. That’s a strategic move at a time when <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-09/ai-s-path-to-profits-is-being-driven-by-consumers\" target=\"_blank\">consumers are driving AI profits</a>, while <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\" target=\"_blank\">GenAI pilots at companies</a> often fail.</p>\n<p>To counter this, Google noted that 65% of Google Cloud customers are using its AI products. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Alongside the Figma deal, Google also <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-gemini-enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> AI deals with GAP, Gordon Foods, Klarna, Macquarie Bank, Melexis, Mercedes, Signal Iduna, Valiuz, and Virgin Voyages.

Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT’s 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the publication of this article, OpenAI’s head of Sora, Bill Peebles, <a href=\"https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1976099194407616641\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that Sora reached a million downloads in under five days. He said that it was faster than ChatGPT, despite Sora being in invite-only mode. (Sora is iOS-only for now.) </p>\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div><p>sora hit 1M app downloads in <5 days, even faster than chatgpt did (despite the invite flow and only targeting north america!)!</p><p>team working hard to keep up with surging growth. more features and fixes to overmoderation on the way!</p></div>— Bill Peebles (@billpeeb) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/billpeeb/status/1976099194407616641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n<p>ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures data indicated that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT’s launch on iOS alone, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.</p>\n<p>This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora requires an invite to get in, while ChatGPT was publicly available at launch. That makes Sora’s performance more impressive.</p>\n<p>During its first day, Sora saw 56,000 iOS app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, Appfigures said. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora’s debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and put it on par with xAI’s Grok launch.</p>\n<p>A quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures’ data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere. Users are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/you-cant-libel-the-dead-but-that-doesnt-mean-you-should-deepfake-them/\">even creating deepfakes of dead people</a>, a use case that has prompted Zelda Williams, daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, to ask folks to stop sending her AI-generated images of her father.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"an Appfigures graph showing Sora's growth over the past week between Sept. 30 and Oct 6, showing daily app store downloads surpassing ChatGPT.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png 1730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Per Appfigures, the app has seen steady adoption since its first day on the market, September 30, 2025.

The company employs 18 trained beagles to discern cancer-specific odors. The dogs are taught to sit if they smell cancer particles, and SpotitEarly’s AI platform validates the dogs’ behavior.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We have cameras on top of the lab. We have a microphone that captures the dogs’ breathing patterns. We also monitor their heart rate. So basically, the machine learning knows the baseline of the entire dog pack,” Madar said. “That’s what makes it more accurate than just a handler looking at a dog.”</p>\n<p>The company’s research, published in<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79383-2\" target=\"_blank\"> Nature’s Scientific Reports</a>, showed that its trained dogs can detect early cancer in breath samples with 94% accuracy. That double-blind clinical study, involving 1,400 individuals, was focused on screening for the four most common cancers: breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung.</p>\n<p>SpotitEarly, which was founded in Israel in 2020, announced in May its launch into the U.S. market with $20.3 million in funding from Hanaco VC, Menomedin VC, Jeff Swartz (former CEO of Timberland), and Avishai Abrahami (CEO of Wix.com.)</p>\n<p>The company plans to use the capital to significantly expand its clinical studies, starting with individual tests for breast cancer before moving on to the other three targeted cancers.</p>\n<p>Madar said that SpotitEarly’s at-home screening kits should be available to consumers through a physicians’ network next year. A single cancer test will be priced at around $250, and screening for each additional cancer will cost a fraction of the first test, he said. To prioritize accessibility, the company aims to price its multi-cancer panel below the cost of competitors like Grail’s Galleri test, which typically runs for about $950.</p>\n<p>As for the dogs, Madar said they are part of the team. All employees at the company must be “dog people,” Madar said.  “We don’t just use them as biosensors. They have plenty of room to play. They’re great sneakers, great workers, but also great companions.”</p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn from SpotitEarly firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, </em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt</em></a><em>, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em> </p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Getting design and engineering teams on the same page about what digital product to create and how to build it continues to be a challenge. </p>\n<p>A lot of companies find themselves dealing with scattered information, often depending on shared spreadsheets to keep track of design specs and guidelines. Design teams might use tools like Figma, while engineers manage their source code with systems like Git. </p>\n<p>This issue becomes even trickier for large organizations juggling multiple brands and various websites. Miscommunication can pile up quickly, resulting in wasted time and inefficiency.</p>\n<p>That’s where <a href=\"https://www.knapsack.cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Knapsack</a> comes in. It’s a collaboration platform specifically designed for enterprises that need to resolve misunderstandings between UI designers, product managers, and engineers. Knapsack creates a unified workspace that connects with tools like Figma and Git, ensuring that all design changes and code are collected, showcased, and compared in one place. </p>\n<p>This approach makes sure that everything remains up to date, so branding stays consistent across all digital products. For example, if the button is supposed to be 60 pixels, this will be documented in the system, and no sizing mistakes are made.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the company announced a $10 million Series A round, bringing the total raised to date to $20.8 million.</p>\n<p>Alongside the funding, Knapsack is introducing AI capabilities. This includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which is Anthropic’s open source standard that is<strong> </strong>designed to enhance AI models’ ability to generate more relevant responses to specific inquiries by having access to a company’s design and brand standards. The new addition, currently in limited beta, enables teams to use AI agents using models like ChatGPT and Gemini while ensuring these assistants are consistent with their brand and guidelines.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Additionally, an upcoming “ingestion engine” aims to streamline the process of creating a system of record, which is essentially a comprehensive collection of data or information for a company. Traditionally, setting up such systems can take months. Knapsack believes the new engine will reduce that time to just a few days, making it easier for new teams or projects to get up and running more quickly.</p>\n<p>“We work with a very large pharmaceutical company that creates a bunch of sites associated with each of their drug brands. It used to take them about 15 months to launch a new drug property. Now using Knapsack, it takes between two and three months,” CEO Chris Strahl told TechCrunch. He noted that adding the new engine is poised to make this process even faster.</p>\n<p>Another feature, launching later this year, helps teams quickly explore user interfaces (UIs) and generate real webpages using real code. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=430,332 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=720,556 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=668,516 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=485,375 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=687,531 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Knapsack</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Launched in 2022, Knapsack says it serves dozens of Fortune 1000 companies but did not disclose their names. Strahl declined to share subscription pricing details, saying only, “it’s an enterprise product with enterprise pricing.”</p>\n<p>The company currently has nearly 30 full-time employees on the team, and just hired 14 more with the new funding.</p>\n<p>The round was led by Builders VC with participation from Crosslink Capital, Epic Ventures, Mana Ventures, and Lorimer Ventures. Past investors include Alumni, Ascend, Gradient Ventures, Parade Ventures, Founder Collective, Salesforce, and Slack Fund.</p>\n<p>Strahl said he hoped Knapsack would serve as a platform for all kinds of digital experiences in the future, particularly as the power of agentic AI becomes more prevalent.</p>\n<p>“You can envision a future where you’re buying a shoe, and you say to a personal AI agent, ‘Hey, I’d really like some new shoes. I want to be able to go running more frequently,’” Strahl told TechCrunch. “And the agent would go out and understand your preferences based on your history, and take you a pair of shoes, and it would return that into whatever app is running your agent.”</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, that experience should come from Knapsack,” he continued, “and there is this entire world that has yet to be unveiled of how organizations think about expressing their brand through agentic apps and systems that I want to be at the forefront.”</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated after publication.</em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>As AI companies mature, the fight for high-quality data has become one of the most competitive areas in the industry, launching companies like Mercor, Surge, and, most prominently, Alexandr Wang’s Scale AI. But now that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/report-meta-taps-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-to-join-new-superintelligence-lab/\">Wang has moved on to run AI at Meta</a>, many funders see an opening — and are willing to fund companies with compelling new strategies for collecting training data.</p>\n<p>The Y Combinator graduate <a href=\"https://datacurve.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Datacurve</a> is one such company, focusing on high-quality data for software development. On Thursday, the company announced a $15 million Series A round, led by Mark Goldberg at Chemistry with participation from employees at DeepMind, Vercel, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The Series A comes after a $2.7 million seed round, which drew investment from former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.</p>\n<p>Datacurve uses a “bounty hunter” system to attract skilled software engineers to complete the hardest-to-source datasets. The company pays for those contributions, distributing over $1 million in bounties so far.</p>\n<p>But co-founder Serena Ge (pictured above with co-founder Charley Lee) says the biggest motivation isn’t financial. For high-value services like software development, the pay will always be far lower for data work than conventional employment — so the company’s most important edge is a positive user experience.</p>\n<p>“We treat this as a consumer product, not a data labeling operation,” Ge said. “We spend a lot of time thinking about: How can we optimize it so that the people we want are interested and get onto our platform?”</p>\n<p>That’s particularly important as the needs of post-training data grow more complex. While earlier models were trained on simple datasets, today’s AI products rely on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\">complex RL environments</a>, which need to be constructed through specific and strategic data collection. As the environments grow more sophisticated, the data requirements become both more intense for both quantity and quality — a factor that could give high-quality data collection companies like Datacurve an edge.</p>\n<p>As an early-stage company, Datacurve is focused on software engineering, but Ge says the model could apply just as easily to fields like finance, marketing, or even medicine.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“What we’re doing right now is we’re creating an infrastructure for post-training data collection that attracts and retains highly competent people in their own domains,” Ge says.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Apple on Thursday shared how it’s making changes to comply with a Texas state law, SB 2420, which introduces age assurance requirements for app stores and app developers.</p>\n<p>Although Apple already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">rolled out its own age assurance technology</a> and tools earlier this year in anticipation of a regulatory crackdown, the tech giant called out the Texas law over privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>In a developer announcement, Apple explains, “…we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.”</p>\n<p>The Texas law is one of several going into effect in the United States, given the failure of lawmakers and the federal government to create comprehensive internet regulations to protect minors online. As a result, states are coming up with their own laws with similar intentions, but different methods of implementation.</p>\n<p>A tech giant like Apple has the resources to comply with such laws, but smaller developers would not, without Apple’s provided tools. Other smaller startups are impacted by these laws, as well. For instance, social networking startup Bluesky had to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/24/bluesky-blocks-service-in-mississippi-over-age-assurance-law/\">block its service</a> in Mississippi as the company said it didn’t have the resources to comply with the law.</p>\n<p>When the law goes into effect on January 1, 2026, Apple will be required to confirm whether Texas users are 18 years or older, and those under 18 will be required to join a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108380\" target=\"_blank\">Family Sharing group</a>, managed by parents or guardians. Parents and guardians will have to provide consent for all the minor’s App Store downloads, purchases, and transactions, using Apple’s existing in-app purchase system.</p>\n<p>To comply with the law, Apple said it will help developers determine age in a “privacy-preserving way.” For now, developers can use its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/\" target=\"_blank\">Declared Age Range API</a>, which will be updated before the law goes into effect to provide the age categories for new account users in Texas.</p>\n<p>In addition, Apple will roll out new APIs later this year that will allow developers to get parental consent if they make significant changes to their app that would require a different age rating. Parents will also be able to revoke consent after it’s granted, if they determine the app is not appropriate for their child. (Though we can imagine this being used as a new punishment technique; no Instagram for a month!)</p>\n<p>Apple warned developers that similar laws will be coming into effect in Utah and Louisiana later in the year, so they need to get prepared.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name that’s trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the app’s debut. </p>\n<p>According to research provided to TechCrunch upon our request by app intelligence platform <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>, there were over a dozen “Sora”-branded apps that went live on the App Store after the official app’s launch. Over half of them used “Sora 2” in their names specifically. (One of <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@gruber/post/DPZLd-IAF5j\" target=\"_blank\">those was spotted by</a> Apple blogger and pundit, John Gruber, who called it the “App Store scam of the week.”)</p>\n<p>Many of the apps were not newcomers, either. Some had been live on the App Store — sometimes using other names — since earlier in the year or even last year. The impostors, which include those live on Google Play as well, had seen around 300,000 collective installs to date, with north of 80,000 installs coming in after Sora’s official app launch. (OpenAI has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-hit-1m-downloads-faster-than-chatgpt/\">since announced</a> that Sora’s official mobile app has been downloaded 1 million times, for comparison.)</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the impostors had been updated just after OpenAI’s Sora app launch to capitalize on consumer demand and searches, often by changing their name. </p>\n<p>It’s unclear how these apps were able to slip past Apple’s reviewers; Apple did end up pulling many of them from its App Store, Appfigures said.</p>\n<p>Of the imposter apps, the largest one was named “Sora 2 – AI Video Generator” — an obvious attempt to game App Store searches for the keyword “sora.” It saw more than 50,000 installs after the launch of the official app.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As of the time of writing, a few Sora-branded apps are still live, despite the potential for consumer confusion. One, “PetReels — Sora for Pets,” has seen only a few hundred installs, however. Another one, “Viral AI Photo Maker: Vi-sora” is trying to squeeze the word Sora in there but hasn’t gained traction, either.</p>\n<p>Doing slightly better is the app using the branding “Sora 2” in its name (Sora 2 – Video Generator Ai). It’s pulled in north of 6,000 downloads and counting.</p>\n<p>Collectively, the apps earned more than $160,000 — decent money considering their short lives.</p>\n<p>Apple was asked for comment on how Sora-branded apps were able to go live and if these remaining Sora-branded apps would be removed. It did not respond prior to publication. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>India has kicked off a pilot to let consumers shop and pay directly through AI chatbots, with OpenAI’s ChatGPT leading the rollout and integrations with Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude in development, as the South Asian nation becomes the next major market for global AI companies.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the federal body behind the country’s widely used Unified Payments Interface (UPI), partnered with OpenAI and fintech firm Razorpay to enable consumers to shop and pay directly through ChatGPT. Razorpay confirmed to TechCrunch that the pilot is being rolled out nationwide and will become widely available in the coming months.</p>\n<p>The experience is built on <a href=\"https://x.com/NPCI_NPCI/status/1976146268373024807\" target=\"_blank\">UPI Reserve Pay</a> — a new NPCI protocol that allows users to block a specific amount of funds for future debits to designated merchants — and <a href=\"https://www.npci.org.in/product/upi-circle\" target=\"_blank\">UPI Circle</a>, a solution that delegates UPI authentication, enabling payments to be completed directly within ChatGPT without switching to external apps or websites. Razorpay has developed the merchant integration layer that allows businesses to transact through AI chatbots.</p>\n<p>Tata Group-owned online grocer BigBasket and telecom operator Vi are the initial merchant partners for the new pilot, allowing customers to shop for groceries or purchase mobile recharge plans directly through ChatGPT. Additionally, Axis Bank and Airtel Payments Bank are powering the banking layer.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=1200,756 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=1280,806 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=430,271 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=720,453 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=900,567 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=800,504 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=1536,967 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=668,421 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=596,375 596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=980,617 980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=708,446 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/razorpay-chatgpt-e-commerce.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Razorpay</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>India, the world’s most populous nation and home to over a billion internet subscribers, is already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/chatgpt-adoption-skyrockets-in-india-but-monetization-may-be-trailing/\" target=\"_blank\">one of OpenAI’s top markets for ChatGPT</a>. OpenAI has been looking to grow its footprint in the country, launching a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan</a> in August to attract more subscribers. The commerce pilot is part of its broader push to deepen engagement and tap into India’s rapidly expanding digital economy.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just a payment experience,” said Razorpay co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur, in an interview. “It’s a whole new discovery and commerce experience.”</p>\n<p>UPI is already a massive success in India, powering over 20 billion transactions each month and serving as the country’s leading digital payments channel. Still, the new AI-led experience could help NPCI drive further adoption by embedding UPI into everyday commerce if consumers embrace chatbots as a new interface for shopping.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Mathur told TechCrunch that the company has also completed a proof-of-concept for the new agentic payment experience with Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude. These integrations will go live for consumers in a few weeks, he said.</p>\n<p>Razorpay is also in talks with merchants other than BigBasket and Vi and is expecting a broader rollout in the next couple of months, Mathur said.</p>\n<p>Like OpenAI, both Google and Anthropic are seeing a surge of new users from India. While Google already has a deep local presence — with mass-market products like Android, Search, and YouTube — OpenAI and Anthropic are now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\">taking steps to establish a footprint</a> in the country as they work to localize their AI offerings for Indian users.</p>\n<p>India’s current plan with agentic payments does not involve any specific revenue-sharing model for partners involved. However, the move would help AI companies, including OpenAI, achieve greater user retention.</p>\n<p>Mathur confirmed to TechCrunch that AI companies will not get access to the payment data under the new setup, and users will pre-authorize the amount transacted through chatbots through two-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>Last month, OpenAI introduced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\" target=\"_blank\">“Instant Checkout” experience</a> and its Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed in partnership with Stripe, to help businesses and merchants connect with consumers using AI agents. Similarly, Google launched its <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">Agent Payments Protocol</a> to enable AI agents to make transactions on behalf of users.</p>\n<p>“This is still an early, forward-looking concept, but one with tremendous potential. Its adoption will naturally grow in line with how fast shopping agents take off,” Reeju Datta, co-founder of Cashfree Payments, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=1200,671 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=1280,716 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=720,403 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=900,503 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=800,448 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=1536,859 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=1103,617 1103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=708,396 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cashfree-agentic-payments.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cashfree Payments</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In addition to Razorpay, online merchant payments startup Cashfree Payments has launched its Agentic Payments MCP that can help merchants enable payments directly through their shopping agents.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The explosion of AI companies has pushed demand for computing power to new extremes, and companies like CoreWeave, Together AI and Lambda Labs have capitalized on that demand, attracting immense amounts of attention and capital for their ability to offer distributed compute capacity.</p>\n<p>But most companies still store data with the big three cloud providers, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, whose storage systems were built to keep data close to their own compute resources, not spread across multiple clouds or regions.</p>\n<p>“Modern AI workloads and AI infrastructure are choosing distributed computing instead of big cloud,” Ovais Tariq, co-founder and CEO of Tigris Data, told TechCrunch. “We want to provide the same option for storage, because without storage, compute is nothing.” </p>\n<p>Tigris, founded by the team that developed Uber’s storage platform, is building a network of localized data storage centers that it claims can meet the distributed compute needs of modern AI workloads. The startup’s AI-native storage platform “moves with your compute, [allows] data [to] automatically replicate to where GPUs are, supports billions of small files, and provides low-latency access for training, inference, and agentic workloads,” Tariq said. </p>\n<p>To do all of that, Tigris recently raised a $25 million Series A round that was led by Spark Capital and saw participation from existing investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The startup is going against the incumbents, who Tariq calls “Big Cloud.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?w=384\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png 384w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=38,50 38w\" /><figcaption><span>Ovais Tariq, CEO of Tigris, at a Tigris data center in Virginia</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tigris Data</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tariq feels these incumbents not only offer a more expensive data storage service, but also a less efficient one. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have historically charged egress fees (dubbed “cloud tax” in the industry) if a customer wants to migrate to another cloud provider, or download and move their data if they want to, say, use a cheaper GPU or train models in different parts of the world simultaneously. Think of it like having to pay your gym extra if you want to stop going there.</p>\n<p>According to Batuhan Taskaya, head of engineering at Fal.ai, one of Tigris’ customers, those costs once accounted for the majority of Fal’s cloud spending.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Beyond egress fees, Tariq says there’s still the problem of latency with larger cloud providers. “Egress fees were just one symptom of a deeper problem: centralized storage that can’t keep up with a decentralized, high-speed AI ecosystem,” he said. </p>\n<p>Most of Tigris’ 4,000+ customers are like Fal.ai: generative AI startups building image, video, and voice models, which tend to have large, latency-sensitive datasets.  </p>\n<p>“Imagine talking to an AI agent that’s doing local audio,” Tariq said. “You want the lowest latency. You want your compute to be local, close by, and you want your storage to be local, too.” </p>\n<p>Big clouds aren’t optimized for AI workloads, he added. Streaming massive datasets for training or running real-time inference across multiple regions can create latency bottlenecks, slowing model performance. But being able to access localized storage means data is retrieved faster, which means developers can run AI workloads reliably and more cost-effectively using decentralized clouds. </p>\n<p>“Tigris lets us scale our workloads in any cloud by providing access to the same data filesystem from all these places without charging egress,” Fal’s Taskaya said.</p>\n<p>There are other reasons why companies want to have data closer to their distributed cloud options. For example, in highly regulated fields like finance and healthcare, one large roadblock to adopting AI tools is that enterprises need to ensure data security. </p>\n<p>Another motivation, says Tariq, is that companies increasingly want to own their data, pointing to how Salesforce earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforce-blocks-ai-rivals-using-slack-data\" target=\"_blank\">blocked its AI rivals</a> from using Slack data. “Companies are becoming more and more aware of how important the data is, how it’s fueling the LLMs, how it’s fueling the AI,” Tariq said. “They want to be more in control. They don’t want someone else to be in control of it.” </p>\n<p>With the fresh funds, Tigris intends to continue building its data storage centers to support increasing demand — Tariq says the startup has grown 8x every year since its founding in November 2021. Tigris already has three data centers in Virginia, Chicago, and San Jose, and wants to continue expanding in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia, specifically in London, Frankfurt, and Singapore.  </p>\n</div>"

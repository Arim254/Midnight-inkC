Discord, the popular chat and community platform, filed confidential IPO paperwork with the SEC and has pinned its hopes on a debut in March, sources told Bloomberg. The company hired top-tier tech IPO bankers Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as its underwriters. Should the tea leaves continue to look positive for this offering, the public could be getting a peek at Discord’s finances next month.\nBut we’ll have to wait and see. Even if investors are gung-ho, it’s not clear yet whether 2026 will become a better market for IPOs. Discord was reportedly in early-stage talks about an IPO back in March of last year. But then came chaos in the U.S. federal government — between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-inspired budget cuts and the end-of-year federal shutdown — scaring off IPO hopefuls.\nIf the current stock market rally continues and encourages late-stage startups to go public, Discord’s IPO could be one of the biggest of the year. Discord was last valued at $14.7 billion in a 2021 funding round in which it raised $500 million. \nThe chat app, originally made popular by gamers, now claims more than 200 million monthly active users. The company reportedly walked away from a $10 billion acquisition offer by Microsoft in 2021 to remain independent.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n"

The parties have agreed in principle to settle; now comes the harder work of finalizing the details.\nThese are among the first settlements in lawsuits accusing AI companies of harming users, a legal frontier that must have OpenAI and Meta watching nervously from the wings as they defend themselves against similar lawsuits. \nCharacter.AI founded in 2021 by ex-Google engineers who returned to their former employer in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal, invites users to chat with AI personas. The most haunting case involves Sewell Setzer III, who at age 14 conducted sexualized conversations with a “Daenerys Targaryen” bot before killing himself. His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be “legally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.”\nAnother lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for limiting screen time. Character.AI banned minors last October, it told TechCrunch. The settlements will likely include monetary damages, though no liability was admitted in court filings made available Wednesday.\nCharacter.AI declined to comment, redirecting TechCrunch instead to the filings.

    "body": "\nOpenAI announced ChatGPT Health on Wednesday, which the company said will offer a dedicated space for users to have conversations with ChatGPT about their health.\nPeople already use ChatGPT to ask about medical issues; OpenAI says that over 230 million people ask health and wellness questions on the platform each week. But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. \nIf people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.\nWithin Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.\nChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.\nThe CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.\nWhile the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to hallucinations.\nIn its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.” \nThe feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI.

    "body": "\nSkylight may have started as a digital picture frame, but today, the company is more focused on helping families stay organized with shared calendars, lists, meal planning tools, and more.\nAt CES 2026, the company debuted its latest product: the Skylight Calendar 2, which offers a sleeker design than the original 15-inch calendar but smaller than the 27-inch wall-mounted Calendar Max. Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.\nThe biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.\nThe calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.)\nImage Credits:Sarah Perez\nThe company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use.\nThe app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use. For instance, they can check off their chores by looking for a picture, even if they can’t yet read. \n\nParents also like the ability to plan meals, whether that’s noting simply that Tuesday will be taco night, or going as far as finding a recipe and preparing a shopping list. Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app.\nAnother clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand.\nThe need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers. Skylight, a bootstrapped and profitable company from day one, now has 1.3 million-plus families using its digital calendars so far, and likely more to come as the new design ships.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb. Prior to her work as a reporter, Sarah worked in I.T. across a number of industries, including banking, retail and software.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sarah by emailing sarahp@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at sarahperez.01 on Signal. \t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWaymo has spent the past three years refining and testing a minivan-like vehicle made by Chinese automaker Zeekr. And now, before this robotaxi joins Waymo’s official commercial fleet, it’s getting a new name, the company told TechCrunch. \nThe Zeekr RT robotaxi will now be named Ojai (pronounced “oh-hi”) — after the village in the Topatopa Mountains above Los Angeles that is known for its arts community and focus on wellness. \nWaymo’s official explanation, per spokesperson Chris Bonelli, is that the company determined the U.S. public isn’t familiar with the Zeekr brand. That branding may even carry through to the rider experience. Apparently, when customers eventually get into the Ojai, the robotaxi will greet them with an “Oh hi” and their name. Cute. \nOf course, in the U.S. it might not hurt to ditch the name of a Chinese automaker either. \nFor those unfamiliar, Waymo first struck a partnership with Geely Holding Group-owned Zeekr in 2021. Waymo showed off a concept of a purpose-built robotaxi the following year at a splashy event in Los Angeles. The prototype was based on a version of Zeekr’s  SEA-M architecture designed for “future mobility products” like robotaxis and logistics vehicles. \nNotably, the prototype didn’t have a steering wheel. But the Ojai one, which was shown off at CES 2026, does.\nThe Zeekr RT (now Ojai) has gone through some fine-tuning over the years as it has gone through development and testing in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. Last year at CES, Waymo gave the robotaxi the now-retired name of Zeekr RT and showcased some of its hardware, including 13 cameras, four lidar, six radar, an array of external audio receivers, and the tiniest sensor wipers you’ve ever seen. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat hardware suite is the same. But the paint color has been tweaked, according to the company. Waymo told TechCrunch the paint color, which had a blueish tint, is now more silver. \nAll of these final tweaks have happened ahead of Ojai’s imminent launch into commercial service. Waymo employees, and their family and friends, are now able to hail the Zeekr van in San Francisco and Phoenix — typically one of the last steps before it becomes available to the public. \nWaymo is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The company, which offers a commercial robotaxi service in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, plans to launch in a dozen more cities over the next year. Those cities include Denver, Las Vegas, and London. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAfter leading General Catalyst’s seed strategy for years, Niko Bonatsos has departed the firm. Known for backing an IPO-hopeful Discord and the $10 billion startup Mercor, Bonatsos told TechCrunch he intends to launch a new early-stage VC firm alongside “friends.”\nBonatsos is the latest investor to leave General Catalyst, a firm that recently expanded beyond the traditional venture model. Over the last few years, General Catalyst unveiled a wealth management business, a strategy focused on PE-style AI roll-ups, and a Customer Value Fund (CVF), which provides late-stage startups with nondilutive financing secured by recurring revenue.\nOther recent General Catalyst departures include Deep Nishar and Kyle Doherty, who co-led the late-stage ‘Endurance’ strategy, and Adam Valkin, who co-led the early-stage fund alongside Bonatsos and Trevor Oelschig, TechCrunch reported last year.\nUnlike his former colleagues, who declined to comment about their departures, Bonatsos described his exit as a mutual decision, saying that his time at GC was an “awesome experience,” which provided many “learnings.”\nBonatsos said he has yet to choose a name for his new firm or begin fundraising. He declined to specify the size of his team, noting only that the individuals he is considering include founders and investors “at the top of their game.”\nSome of the themes Bonatsos intends to pursue include backing young founders, a trend he claims to have identified several years ago, before it became popular in the industry. Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.\nBonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlthough General Catalyst has transitioned into what it calls an “investment and transformation company,” it is continuing to make seed-stage bets. Last year, GC hired Yuri Sagalov, a former YC partner who also founded Wayfinder Ventures, to lead seed investing in the U.S.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFord is developing an AI assistant that will debut in the company’s smartphone app, before expanding to its vehicles in 2027, the company announced Wednesday at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.\nWednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”\nFord says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life. \nThe company is rolling the assistant out to its newly revamped Ford app in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.\nFord didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers. \nJust last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.\nThe new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFord is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028. But it also claims the system will be capable of handling “point-to-point autonomy,” similar to what Tesla offers with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Rivian has also teased a point-to-point system coming later this year. All of these systems require the drivers to be ready to take control of the car at any moment. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.\n“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”\nThe exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”\nAsked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.” \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOver the past few days, several posts on LinkedIn and Twitter/X went viral after one of the most talked about AI companies in San Francisco suddenly vanished from LinkedIn: Artisan AI.  \nThe company’s LinkedIn page, individual employee profiles, and posts from executives all displayed a “This post cannot be displayed” message.  \nThe startup had been banned from the site, Artisan CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack confirmed to TechCrunch. However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated. \n “Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said. \nContrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service. \nArtisan AI is a graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted around town. Artisan offers an AI agent it calls Ava that does outbound sales by finding and contacting potential customers. LinkedIn is famously precious turf for outbound marketing salespeople — both human and, increasingly, AI.\nWhile a couple of LinkedIn users seemed to notice Artisan’s ban about a week ago, the posts and tweets about it really picked up steam this week. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCarmichael-Jack explained that LinkedIn’s “enforcement team reached out to us, and they basically restricted our accounts completely, so we disappeared from the platform whilst they were reviewing it, which was not ideal. But it was kind of funny, because once we were restricted, our lead flow suddenly started inching up every day. And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.” \nAs a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.” \nThe truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email. \nTo appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.\nWhile Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.\n“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months — outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said. \nInterestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent last year called Hiring Assistant, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too. LinkedIn did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. \nIn any case, Artisan’s very public banning can be seen as a warning for all agentic players looking for sources of data: Big Tech is watching. \n"

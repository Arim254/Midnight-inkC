If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.\nWith a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It’s unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.\nThe Japanese investor is a partner in the Stargate project with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are in the process of building a “proof of concept” data center at GM’s former Lordstown automotive assembly plant.\nA power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to our calculations based on public, energy-use metrics. When including methane leaks from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could be even bigger. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Climate\n\n"

    "body": "\nIf you work in tech, Wired’s new cover story isn’t exactly going to shatter your worldview, but it’s a genuinely great read all the same. \nReporter Zoë Bernard spent months talking to 51 people (31 of them gay men) to map out a subculture that’s been an open secret in Silicon Valley for years: gay men, at the upper echelons of tech, quietly raising up their own networks the way powerful people have always done.\nOne angel investor puts it plainly: “The gays who work in tech are succeeding vastly… they support each other, whether that’s to hire someone or angel invest in their companies or lead their funding rounds.” Another source frames it almost philosophically: “Straight guys have the golf course. Gay guys have the orgy. It doesn’t mean it’s problematic. It’s a way we bond and connect.”\nThe piece doesn’t let the culture off the hook entirely. As is true wherever power dynamics exist, nine of the gay men interviewed describe experiencing unwanted advances from more senior colleagues — and Bernard doesn’t shy from examining where networking ends and coercion begins. But her sources are careful about what that means: “This is a complex subject and I don’t think readers can draw the distinction between some bad men being gay and all gay men being bad. It can be a slippery slope into homophobia.”\n"

    "body": "\nReddit announced on Thursday that it’s testing a new AI search tool that takes community recommendations and matches them with products from some of the company’s shopping and advertising partners. \nA small group of users in the U.S. will start to see search results that include interactive product carousels with pricing, images, and direct where-to-buy links.\nThe announcement reflects Reddit’s broader push to combine its community-driven platform with e-commerce capabilities. The move comes as Reddit launched its first shoppable ad product last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.\nNow, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results. \nThis carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item. \n“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”\nWhile platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an “Instant Checkout” feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThursday’s announcement comes after Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said during the company’s earnings release last week that the platforms’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.\nHuffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo’s big chance to bring its robotaxis to the state of New York has been thwarted — for now. \nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul withdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws to effectively legalize robotaxis in the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled. \n“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was the first to report the proposal had been removed.\nThe withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.\n“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. \n“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”\n“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHochul had introduced, as part of her broader budget proposal, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.\nEven if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.\nWith that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.\nWaymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31. \nNew York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.\nWaymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting one million weekly rides by the end of the year.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nSpaceX’s company town in Texas, Starbase, is less than a year old, but it already has its own volunteer fire department and is working on creating a police department. Now it wants its own court, too. \nStarbase’s city administrator submitted a proposed ordinance to the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.\nThe formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services. \nIn addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the city decided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.) \nStarbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months. \nDuring Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.\nThe city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.\n“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in court on Wednesday in a landmark trial aiming to determine if the tech giant’s social media applications are addictive and harmful to teens and kids. The trial, taking place in LA Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s own research indicated that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.\nLawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier congressional hearing that this was not the case, the AP noted, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase users’ time spent in app by 12%.\nZuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One Meta document from 2018 stated that, as of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.\nHere, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its own age assurance tools for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where many states have now created or are developing their own social media laws.)\nReports from the courtroom noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were taking things out of context or mischaracterizing what documents said.\nPlaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. TikTok and Snap settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success. \nDuring the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:01 AM PST · February 19, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nMeta is shutting down its standalone Messenger website, the company shared in a help page. Starting April 2026, the website will no longer be available. If users still want to send and receive messages on the web, they can do so while logged into Facebook. \n“After messenger.com goes away, you will be automatically redirected to use facebook.com/messages for messaging on a computer,” the help page reads. “You can continue your conversations there or on the Messenger mobile app.” \nIf you use Messenger without a Facebook account, then you’ll only be able to continue your conversations on the Messenger mobile app. Users can restore their chat history on any platform using the PIN they entered when they first created a backup on Messenger. If you can’t remember your PIN, you can reset it.\nThe move comes a few months after Meta shut down Messenger’s stand-alone desktop apps for Windows and Mac. The writing may have been on the wall at the time, as Meta had been redirecting existing desktop app users to the Facebook website to continue using the messaging service, rather than the Messenger website.\nThe change was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi. Meta is notifying users of the update via a pop-up message on the Messenger website and app. \nUsers have taken to social media to express their frustration with the update, with many saying they don’t want to rely on the Facebook website to send and receive Messenger chats on the web, especially those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts. \nWhile Meta’s decision to shut down various Messenger platforms is frustrating for users, it allows the tech giant to reduce costs by leaving it with fewer platforms to maintain.\nMessenger first launched as “Facebook Chat” back in 2008, and Facebook (now Meta) launched Facebook Messenger as a standalone app in 2011. Over the years, the tech giant positioned Messenger as its own service outside of Facebook, and in 2014, the social network removed messaging capabilities from its main mobile app to push people to the Messenger app. However, the company reversed this in 2023 when it began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA student admissions website used by families to enroll children into schools has fixed a security lapse that was exposing their personal information.\nThe website, Ravenna Hub, which lets parents apply and track the status of their kids’ applications across thousands of schools, was allowing any logged-in user to access the personally identifiable data associated with any other user, including their children.\nThe exposed data includes children’s names, dates of birth, addresses, pictures, and details about their school. Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.\nFlorida-based VenturEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, says on Ravenna Hub’s website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.\nTechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VenturEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.\nNick Laird, the chief executive of VenturEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.\nLaird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.\nIt’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VenturEd and Ravenna Hub.\nThe vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common security flaw that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers. \nIn practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar. \nIn the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.\nWhen TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.\nThis is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users, many of whom are still in school. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nRivian has a new pitch for its outdoorsy, tech-loving customers: Ditch the phone and use your Apple Watch to access vehicle controls.\nThe company said on Thursday it plans to launch a companion app next week that pairs with the Apple Watch as part of a broader update to the Rivian mobile app. Rivian owners will be able to perform basic tasks such as locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and triggering the vehicle alarm using their Apple Watch.\nRivian said it is adding more precise and customizable functions, too. For instance, users can adjust the digital crown on the watch to set a target state of charge or adjust the temperature inside the vehicle. The app also allows users to pick four quick controls, depending on which they use the most.\nThere are some limitations, however, for Rivian’s first-generation R1T trucks and R1S SUVs. Owners of these cars will only be able to lock or unlock their vehicle by opening the app and tapping the lock icon on the Watch. Second-generation R1 vehicles, meanwhile, will unlock automatically as the driver approaches the car, provided a digital key has been set up.\nThe Apple Watch integration follows a broader update to the vehicle software system that was rolled out on Thursday.\nMost of the updates focus on improving performance and accessibility, including a “kneel mode” that lowers the vehicle another inch below its previous low setting. The update will also allow drivers to toggle between different drive modes without causing the advanced driver assistance system to disengage. \nThere’s also a new cold weather indicator that will add a blue tint to the battery graphic displayed on the vehicle’s digital screen so drivers can see how much energy the battery pack is used for warming.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRivian makes and sells EVs, but software has become one of its central products, and a selling point, for consumers as well as companies like Volkswagen that have tapped the carmaker for its technology. In 2024, Rivian and VW set up a $5.8 billion technology joint venture under which Volkswagen will invest in Rivian, based on reaching certain milestones, through 2027.

    "body": "\nOpenAI is partnering with Reliance to add AI-powered conversational search to the Indian conglomerate’s streaming service JioHotstar. \nThe feature, which is powered by OpenAI’s API, will let users search for movies, shows, and live sports using text and voice prompts in multiple languages, and receive recommendations based on their preferences and history.\nOpenAI has recently expanded its footprint in India, which is home to more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users. The company plans to open offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its current office in New Delhi.\nThe partnership was announced at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where Sam Altman is appearing alongside industry leaders, including Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Google’s Sundar Pichai.\nThe companies also plan to extend the partnership to surface JioHotstar recommendations directly within ChatGPT, allowing users who search for entertainment through ChatGPT to receive contextual suggestions and deep links into the platform’s catalogue. The move positions the integration as a two-way discovery layer rather than a standalone in-app feature.\nThe move comes as streaming and TV platforms increasingly experiment with conversational interfaces. Netflix said in May 2025 it was testing a new search experience using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to help viewers find content through natural language, while Google in November introduced Gemini-powered discovery features for its Google TV platform.\nFidji Simo, chief executive of applications at OpenAI, said the partnership is aimed at bringing more personalized AI experiences into entertainment and live sports, enabling viewers to move “from curiosity to context” through natural interactions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEmbedding AI into content discovery will help reshape how audiences find and engage with programming, said Uday Shankar, vice chairperson of JioStar.\nThe rollout will span both live and on-demand formats, the companies said.\nThe JioHotstar partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader “OpenAI for India” push to deepen its presence in the South Asian nation through infrastructure, enterprise, and education partnerships.

    "body": "\nAs AI companies and startups push their way into the web browser market, the world’s biggest browser, Google Chrome, is rolling out a handful of new features. The company on Thursday announced the official launch of a trio of options, including Split View, PDF annotations, and a “Save to Google Drive” feature, designed to more deeply integrate Chrome with one of Google’s other online services.\nWhile these particular additions aren’t focused on AI, Google already integrated its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome. The move was made in response to the increased competition from AI providers like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are dabbling in agentic browsers. These so-called browser wars have pushed Google to be less stagnant in terms of developing and releasing more consumer-facing features.\nWith Split View, multitasking in Chrome has become easier as the feature puts two pages side-by-side in the same tab. This lets you work across two webpages or watch a video while taking notes, among other things. To use the feature, you’ll drag a tab to the left or right edge of the browser window or right-click a link and select “Open Link in Split View.” The tabs will automatically snap into place. When no longer needed, you can exit the Split View layout via an option found via a right-click.\nImage Credits:Google\nAnother practical addition is the PDF annotations feature, which lets you add notes to a PDF or highlight its text from the browser. This means you don’t have to download the PDF and then open it in another application to work with its content. The option, a long time coming, could make it much simpler to do basic PDF tasks, like digitally signing a document, filling out a form, making notes within a file or personal document, and more. \nImage Credits:Google\nFinally, the new Save to Google Drive feature will allow you to save any PDF directly to your Google Drive account, instead of your computer, where it may get lost. When using this feature, the saved files will appear in a “Saved from Chrome” folder in your Drive, making them easy to find. \nImage Credits:Google\nToday’s update follows the expansion of Gemini and other agentic features to Chromebook users last month. And soon, Chrome is poised to adopt another change that was first spearheaded by its competitors: support for vertical tabs. (Tech-savvy users can even enable that option now, in an experimental phase, by changing a flag.)\nThis reimagined way to organize open tabs was one of the flagship features in The Browser Company’s first alternative browser, Arc, and is now found in its  AI browser, Dia. By adding this feature and the others, Google hopes to give Chrome users fewer reasons to switch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTech investors haven’t given up on the dream of making physical products with the same speed and ease as coding software. \nExecutives at Freeform, a startup developing a novel 3D-printing system for metal components, told TechCrunch that the company raised a $67 million Series B to expand its manufacturing platform. \nInvestors include Apandion, AE Ventures, Founders Fund, Linse Capital, Nvidia’s NVentures, Threshold Ventures, and Two Sigma Ventures. FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which PitchBook cites as $179 million.\nCEO and co-founder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. \nThat’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch launched in 2018 after developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. \nTheir new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a partnership with Nvidia that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.\n“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We’re running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe data collected by sensors in the company’s manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity. \n“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said. \nWhile Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers each week. Now, the company wants to hire as many as 100 new employees and expand its facility to start executing on its contract backlog. \nManufacturing-as-a-service has grown as a category as venture investors have taken a greater interest in building vehicles, robots, and energy production systems. For example, Hadrian recently earned a $1.6B valuation from its investors while developing automated production for defense, and VulcanForms and Divergent have raised hundreds of millions to develop metal-printing services of their own.\nCorrection: This piece originally reported that Thomas Ronacher is president of Freeform, but he has left the company.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTim Fernholz is a journalist who writes about technology, finance and public policy.

    "body": "\nMuch of the conversation around AI today is focused on building cloud capacity and massive data centers to run models. Companies like Apple and Qualcomm are in the early stages of making on-device AI more useful. Amid all that, the 14-person technical team of London-based Mirai is working to improve how models run on phones and laptops.\nMirai, which is backed by a $10 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, was founded by Dima Shvets and Alexey Moiseenkov last year. Both founders have experience in building scalable consumer apps. Shvets co-founded face-swapping app Reface, which was backed by a16z. Shvets later also became a scout for the venture firm. Moiseenkov was CEO and co-founder of the last decade’s viral AI filters app, Prisma.\nAs consumer developers, both had been thinking about AI and machine learning on devices even before generative AI became popular, Shvets said.\n“When we met together in London, we started to chat about technology, and we realized that within the hype of GenAI and more AI adoption, everybody speaks about cloud, about servers, about AGI coming. But the missing piece is on-device [AI] for consumer hardware,” he told TechCrunch.\nShvets and Moiseenkov wanted to use AI to create a pipeline that would allow them to enable complex tasks on the phone, which led them to start Mirai. When they asked others who developed consumer apps, they heard that many wanted better cost optimization and margin per token usage, too.\nCo-founders Alexey Moiseenkov and Dima ShvetsImage Credits:Mirai\nToday, Mirai is developing a framework for models so they can perform better on devices. The company has built an inference engine for Apple Silicon that optimizes on-device throughput. With its upcoming SDK, developers can integrate the runtime in their apps with only a few lines, the company says.\n“One of the visions why we started the company was that we wanted to give developers, like this Stripe-like, eight lines of code [integration] experience…you basically go to our platform, integrate the key, and start working with summarization, classification, or whatever your use case is,” Shvets said.\nThe startup built this engine in Rust, which can bump up a model’s generation speed by up to 37%, they claim. The company said that, while tuning the model for a platform, it doesn’t tinker with model weights to ensure there is no loss in quality of the output.\nMirai’s stack currently focuses on improving text and voice modalities on the platform, with plans to support vision in the future. The team has started to work with frontier model providers to tune their models for edge use and is in talks with different chipmakers. Later, it plans to bring its engine to Android, too. \nIn addition, Mirai aims to release on-device benchmarks so model makers can test on-device performance. Shvets recognizes that not all AI work can be done on-device, though. To enable a mixed mode of operation, the team is building an orchestration layer to send requests that can’t be fulfilled on the device up to the cloud.\nWhile the startup is not directly working with apps just yet, its engine could power on-device assistants, transcribers, translators, and chat apps, we’re told.\nAndy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, noted that he invested in an edge machine learning company in the last decade. He said that the company was early and eventually sold its business to Spotify. In today’s world, the situation is different, he thinks.\n“Given the cost of cloud inference, something has to change… For now, VCs are happy to continue funding the rocket ship companies, spending inordinate sums on cloud inference. But that won’t last  —  at some point, people will focus on the underlying economics of these businesses and realize that something has to change,” he said. “It feels like every model maker will want to run part of their inference workloads at the edge, and Mirai feels very well-positioned to capture this demand.”\nMirai’s seed round also saw participation from individuals, including Dreamer CEO David Singleton, YC Partner Francois Chaubard, Snowflake co-founder Marcin Żukowski, ElevenLabs co-founder Mati Staniszewski, former Google AdSense product manager and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram, Groq investor Scooter Braun, Turing.com CTO Vijay Krishnan, Theory Forge Ventures’ Ben Parr and Matt Schlicht, and ex-Netflix technical leader Aditya Jami.\n"

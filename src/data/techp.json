    "body": "\nTikTok settled a high-profile lawsuit on Monday evening, which alleges that social media companies intentionally make their products addictive, causing harm to users. Snap settled the case last week, but Meta and YouTube — the other defendants — are now heading to trial, where jury selection begins on Tuesday.\nCentering around a 19-year-old plaintiff known by the initials K.G.M., this case is the first of many similar legal challenges against social platforms. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and YouTube head Neal Mohan are expected to testify, which could set a precedent for how dozens of other lawsuits could play out.\nBy settling the case, TikTok and Snap are not necessarily admitting to the allegations. Rather, they came to an agreement with the plaintiff outside of court, though the terms of these settlements are not known. \n"

    "body": "\nGoogle on Tuesday announced its more affordable Google AI Plus plan is now available in all markets where its AI plans are available. This includes the U.S, where it will cost $7.99 per month. \nThe expansion brings the lower-cost plan to 35 new countries and territories, after earlier launches in dozens of global markets, which began with Indonesia last September.\nThe plan includes access to Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in the Gemini app, Flow’s AI filmmaking tools, research and writing assistance in NotebookLM, and more. It also offers 200GB of storage and the ability to share your plan benefits with up to five other family members.\nExisting Google One Premium 2TB subscribers will automatically gain access to all Google AI Plus plan benefits over the next few days, the company says.\nInitially focused on emerging markets, the Google AI Plus plan is designed as the first step beyond free access to Gemini and other AI tools for those who either don’t need or can’t afford to subscribe to the more expensive Google AI Pro plan, which is typically priced at $20 per month.\nWhile the Plus plan’s price point varies by region, its $8 per month price point could introduce a new, more casual audience to Google’s AI technology here in the United States. Elsewhere, the plan tends to cost less than $5 per month. For instance, users in India pay ₹399 ($4.44 USD) per month.\nWhen it first debuted, Google explained that the plan was designed to bring access to Gemini, Veo, and other creative AI tools to emerging markets at a more affordable price point. It’s also designed to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT Go plan, which is $8 per month in the U.S., or less in some emerging markets. These plans are meant to attract the large online population of users who could become regular AI customers over time, giving companies a boost in their AI adoption numbers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the time being, subscribers can take 50% off for the first two months of their subscription in a promotional offering, Google says.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Last week, TikTok announced the creation of a separate U.S. entity with American investors to avoid a nationwide ban.\nAround the time of the transition, users reported issues with TikTok searches, watching videos, posting, loading comments, unexpected behavior with the For You algorithm, content, and more. \nOn Monday, the company attributed glitches to a data center power outage, which it said was impacting TikTok and other apps. \nToday, a post on the TikTok USDS Joint Venture’s X account indicates the outages are not yet fully resolved.\n“We’ve made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure with our U.S. data center partner,” the post states. “However, the U.S. user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content.

Creators may also see zero views or likes on their posts, or their earnings will seem to be missing, but this is also caused by server timeouts. \n“Your actual data and engagement are safe,” the company advised.\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Under this setting, link previews are turned off, and the setting to block a high number of unknown messages is also switched on.\nWhen someone turns this option on, by default, two-step verification is turned on along with security notifications that alert someone when the code of someone they are chatting with changes. \nWhatsApp also restricts your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile are locked to only your contacts.

Your account is locked to more private settings, and your chats with others outside your contacts will have limitations,” the company’s description reads. \nUsers can turn on this setting by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and then turning on Strict account settings.

    "body": "\nChina’s Moonshot AI, which is backed by the likes of Alibaba and HongShan (formerly Sequoia China), today released a new open source model, Kimi K2.5, which understands text, image, and video.\nThe company said that the model was trained on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens, and that’s why it is natively multimodal. It added that the models are good at coding tasks and handling agent swarms —  an orchestration where multiple agents work together. In released benchmarks, the model matches the performance of the proprietary peers and even beats them in certain tasks.\nFor instance, in the coding benchmark, the Kimi K2.5 outperforms Gemini 3 Pro at the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark and scores higher than GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on the SWE-Bench Multilingual benchmark. In video understanding, it beats GPT 5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 on VideoMMMU (video massive multi-discipline multimodal understanding), a benchmark that measures how a model reasons over videos.\nImage Credits:Moonshot AI\nMoonshot AI said that on the coding front, while the model can understand text well, users can also feed it images or videos and ask it to make a similar interface shown in those media files. \n\nHere's a short video from our founder, Zhilin Yang.(It's his first time speaking on camera like this, and he really wanted to share Kimi K2.5 with you!) pic.twitter.com/2uDSOjCjly— Kimi.ai (@Kimi_Moonshot) January 27, 2026\n\nTo let people use these coding capabilities, the company has launched an open source coding tool called Kimi Code, which would rival Anthropic’s Claude Code or Google’s Gemini CLI. Developers can use Kimi Code through their terminals or integrate it with development software such as VSCode, Cursor, and Zed. The startup said that developers can use images and videos as input with Kimi Code.\nCoding tools have gained rapid popularity and are becoming revenue drivers for AI labs. Anthropic announced in November that Claude Code had reached $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). Earlier this month, Wired reported that by the end of 2025, the tool had added $100 million to that figure. Moonshot’s Chinese competitor, DeepSeek, is set to release a new model with strong coding chops next month, according to a report by The Information.\nMoonshot was founded by former Google and Meta AI researcher Yang Zhilin. The company raised $1 billion in funding in a Series B round at a $2.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, the startup picked up $500 million in funding last month at $4.3 billion valuation. What’s more, the report noted that it is already seeking to raise a new round at a $5 billion valuation.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI launched on Tuesday a new scientific workspace program called Prism that is available for free to anyone with a ChatGPT account. Designed as an AI-enhanced word processor and research tool for scientific papers, Prism is deeply integrated with GPT-5.2, which can be used to assess claims, revise prose, or search for prior research.\nPrism isn’t designed to conduct research on its own and without human guidance. Executives believe it will accelerate the work being done by human scientists and compared Prism to coding interfaces like Cursor and Windsurf. \n“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI and software engineering,” Kevin Weill, VP of OpenAI for Science, said in a press call announcing the tool.\nThe new software, which is accessed via a web app, comes as OpenAI is seeing a flood of scientific queries coming to its consumer products like ChatGPT. The company says that ChatGPT receives an average of 8.4 million messages a week on advanced topics in the hard sciences — although it’s difficult to know how many are from professional researchers.\nAI-assisted research is also becoming more common among academic researchers. In mathematics, AI models have been used to prove a number of long-standing Erdos problems through a combination of literature review and new applications of existing techniques. While the significance of the proofs is still hotly debated, the results have been an early victory for proponents of AI models and formal verification systems.\nA statistics paper published in December used GPT 5.2 Pro to establish new proofs for a central axiom of statistical theory, with human researchers only prompting and verifying the model’s work. OpenAI applauded the result in a blog post, presenting it as a model for human-AI collaboration in research going forward.\n“In domains with axiomatic theoretical foundations,” the post reads, “frontier models can help explore proofs, test hypotheses, and identify connections that might otherwise take substantial human effort to uncover.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMuch of the value of OpenAI’s new system comes from simple product work on existing standards. Prism integrates with LaTeX, an open-source system used to format and typeset scientific papers, but goes significantly beyond most available LaTeX software tools. The program also leverages GPT 5.2’s visual capabilities to allow researchers to assemble diagrams from online whiteboard drawings, which can be a significant pain point with existing tools.\nPerhaps the most powerful feature comes from combining the usual powers of an AI model with more rigorous context management. When users open up a ChatGPT window through Prism, the model can access the full context of the research project, making responses both more germane and more intelligent. \nMuch of that would be possible for a savvy user of GPT-5.2, but OpenAI is hoping that a cleaner interface will draw in scientific researchers more quickly. Weill described it as the same combination of factors that made AI tools so powerful in software engineering.\n“Software engineering accelerated in part because of amazing models,” he told reporters, “and in part because of deep workflow integration.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nGoogle on Tuesday announced an expanded set of Android theft-protection features, designed to make its mobile devices less of a target for criminals. Building on existing tools like Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and others introduced in 2024, the newly launched updates include stronger authentication safeguards and enhanced recovery tools, the company said.\nWhile iPhones are often the preferred targets for thieves because of their resale value, Android devices are also subject to theft. That’s particularly true for high-end Android smartphones like the Google Pixel Pro devices, premium foldables, and other top devices from well-known makers like Samsung. \nImage Credits:Google\nWith the new features, users of Android devices running Android 16 or higher will have more control over the Failed Authentication Lock feature that automatically locks the device after an excessive number of failed login attempts. Now users will have access to a dedicated on/off toggle switch in the device’s settings.\nThe devices will also offer stronger protection against a thief trying to guess a device owner’s PIN, pattern, or password by increasing the lockout time after failed attempts. Plus, Identity Check, a feature rolled out for Android 15 and higher last year, now covers all features and apps that use biometrics — like banking apps or the Google Password Manager. \nRemote Lock, a tool that lets you lock a lost or stolen device from a web browser, will now include an optional security challenge or question. With this feature, available to Android 10+, only the real device owner can initiate the lock for added security. \nIn Brazil, two theft protection features will now be enabled by default, including the Theft Detection Lock, which uses on-device AI to sense motion that could indicate a “snatch-and-run” theft. The Remote Lock feature will also be automatically turned on and accessible from the website android.com/lock. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\"Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it's expected to do,” CEO Aron Solberg told TechCrunch.",
    "body": "\nHelp desk automation is a billion-dollar industry, and one of the most likely to be disrupted by tech built upon AI. Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in.\nRisotto is one of those startups, and after today, it will have plenty of runway to test its theory. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and SurgePoint Capital.\nDesigned to autonomously resolve help desk tickets, Risotto sits between ticket management systems like Jira and the complex internal tooling needed to resolve them. The product is built on a third-party foundation model, but CEO Aron Solberg says the core of the business is the infrastructure that sits between the model and the customer, keeping the non-deterministic nature of the model in check.\n“Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it’s expected to do,” Solberg told TechCrunch.\nWorking with the payroll company Gusto, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.\n“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.”\nIn practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It’s a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces.\nIn the meantime, Risotto’s most immediate value proposition comes from taming the mess of different IT systems. As Solberg sees it, there is still plenty of value in making it easier to use existing ticketing systems.\n“One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says. “And that’s to say nothing about implementing AI. That’s just to wrangle the platform itself.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nLuminar received an even higher bid for its lidar business as a court-run auction concluded on Monday, according to a new filing in the company’s bankruptcy case.\nMicroVision, a Redmond, Washington-based company that has been developing its own lidar sensors, submitted a $33 million bid, eclipsing the $22 million that Quantum Computing Inc. laid out a few weeks ago as the “stalking horse” bidder. (Quantum Computing Inc. had upped its bid to $28 million but apparently was unwilling or unable to go higher.)\nIn a statement, MicroVision said Tuesday that it is acquiring “IP and inventory related to the Iris and Halo lidar sensors, key engineering and operations talent, and certain commercial contracts and orders.”\n“It’s no secret that the lidar market has been ripe for disruption and in need of further consolidation,” MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said. “Building on our proven executive leadership in automotive, our history of developing and delivering products in defense, and now an even more expansive portfolio of technologically diverse lidar sensors and advanced perception solutions, we believe MicroVision is ready to upend the industry, enabling widespread commercial adoption and significantly increased safety.”\nThe sale of Luminar’s lidar business will now be subject to approval by the judge in the bankruptcy case. A hearing is slated for Tuesday afternoon. \nIt’s not clear whether Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell submitted a bid for his company’s lidar assets. Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy the company outright in October 2025 before it filed for bankruptcy, and he expressed an interest in making a bid during the bankruptcy process. Representatives for Russell did not respond to a request for comment.\nThat said, Russell and Luminar spent the first month of the bankruptcy case fighting over a subpoena. The company has said it is still evaluating whether to take legal action against Russell, tied to his resignation last May, which followed a board-run ethics inquiry. While Russell already turned over his computers to Luminar, he had been holding on to his phone until he received a guarantee from the company that any personal information on the device would be protected. Luminar accused him of dodging the subpoena.\nRussell ultimately agreed to accept the subpoena last week. Over the weekend, he and Luminar made a joint filing in court laying out the terms of a protective order regarding his personal information.\nIf the sale of the lidar assets goes through, it could bring about a fairly swift end to Luminar’s bankruptcy case, which was filed in December. The company has already reached an agreement to sell its other business division, centered around semiconductors, to Quantum Computing Inc. for $110 million. \nThis story has been updated with a statement from MicroVision.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "description": "Anthropic's Dario Amodei and OpenAI's Sam Altman spoke out against ICE enforcement tactics following Minneapolis violence, with one addressing concerns publicly and the other in an internal message.",
    "body": "\nOn a Monday night NBC News segment, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expressed concern over “some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days,” referring to the violence of Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.\nAmodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nMeanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to the New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.”\n“Part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach,” Altman wrote. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”\nTech workers, including employees of both companies, have been calling on their chiefs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities in the aftermath of Border Patrol agents killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence. \nEmployees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.\n“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch. “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile Amodei and Altman may be taking something of a stand – one in public, the other internally – both CEOs couched their statements with praise for President Trump, as well. \nAmodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death  circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a growing number of Republicans have begun to call for an investigation, as well.) \nIn Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”\nAltman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities. \nJ.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”\nOf course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year, OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another $25 billion at a $350 billion valuation.\nStill, such words of praise for Trump is an about face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his own blog:\n“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”\nAt that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”\n“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.\nAnd Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, calling the decision “crazy” last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”\nWhether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and OpenAI for comment. \nThis story has been updated with comment from J.J. Colao. \nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents? We’re reporting on the inner workings of the AI industry — from the companies shaping its future to the people impacted by their decisions.

    "description": "Pornhub parent company Aylo will restrict access from U.K. users, rather than comply with age verification mandates, which the company said it believes have not succeeded in promoting online safety.",
    "body": "\nAylo, the parent company to some of the most popular tube sites like Pornhub, announced on Tuesday that it will restrict access to its platforms in the United Kingdom, effective February 2.\nSince last year, Pornhub and other Aylo sites had complied with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), which mandated — among other provisions — that websites with pornographic content verify the ages of visitors before showing them content that is inappropriate for minors. \nInstead of verifying the ages of its users, Aylo will block access to platforms like Pornhub in the U.K. altogether; however, U.K. users who have already verified their identity will still be able to use their accounts.\n“Despite the clear intent of the law to restrict minors’ access to adult content and commitment to enforcement, after 6 months of implementation, our experience strongly suggests that the OSA has failed to achieve that objective,” Aylo said in a statement. “We believe this framework in practice has diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet, and has also jeopardized the privacy and personal data of U.K. citizens.”\nOfcom, the UK regulator that enforces OSA, disagrees with Aylo’s characterization of the legislation.\n“Porn services have a choice between using age checks to protect users as required under the Act, or to block access to their sites in the U.K.,” Ofcom said in a statement to TechCrunch. “There’s nothing to stop technology providers from developing solutions which work at the device level, and we would urge the industry to get on with that if they can evidence it is highly effective.”\nAge verification technology has proven controversial as it rolls out across the globe. While children’s online safety is a pressing concern, privacy advocates argue that the type of cloud-based age verification methods mandated by legislation like OSA harms adults by collecting swaths of highly sensitive data.\n“In other jurisdictions, Aylo has often been one of the only major platforms to comply, only to see traffic diverted to even larger, non-compliant sites,” the company said. Sites that do not comply with OSA are supposed to get fined, but Aylo claims that so far, only the forum 4chan has been fined.\nOfcom also disagrees with Aylo’s claim that it is not punishing porn sites for non-compliance.\n“We’ve taken strong and swift action against non-compliance, launching investigations into more than 80 porn sites and fining a porn provider £1 million, with more to come,” Ofcom said.\nThe decision to block access in the U.K. is consistent with Aylo’s decisions around navigating compliance with age verification laws in the United States. Aylo’s websites are blocked in a number of U.S. states where age verification is mandated for adult content, since the company believes that age verification software opens the door to the threat of data breaches.\nThese fears are not unfounded. Pornhub was, in fact, vulnerable to a data breach at the web and mobile analytics provider Mixpanel, which exposed data about some Pornhub Premium subscribers. This stolen data reportedly included information like users’ email addresses, location, videos watched, keywords associated with the video, and the dates and times that they used the site.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Amazon\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:21 AM PST · January 27, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nRIP, Amazon convenience stores: gone and probably soon forgotten.\nAmazon announced on Tuesday that it will close its brick-and-mortar Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores and will instead expand its capacity for same-day grocery delivery, as well as its Whole Foods Market footprint.\nThese stores were used to grow Amazon’s cashierless Just Walk Out technology, which tracks what items customers grab, allowing them to pay for their groceries without a more formal checkout process. The company is instead focusing on offering that technology to third parties, like concession stands at sports stadiums.\n“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” the company wrote in its blog post.\nThese retail closures will not impact customers who use Amazon for grocery delivery. \nIt’s not surprising that Amazon will divest from its branded retail stores, given that Amazon has been cutting down on its physical retail presence over the last few years. Upon closing down some stores in 2024, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “couldn’t make the economics work with the lease cost.”\nAmazon isn’t giving up on the brick-and-mortar side of its business, though. Instead, it will embrace the fact that people have a stronger brand affinity with Whole Foods Market than the Amazon Go convenience store. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon will open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next few years. The company says Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth and expansion to 550 stores since it was acquired by Amazon in 2017.\nAmazon also plans to open more Whole Foods Market Daily Shop locations — a smaller version of the grocery store with an emphasis on convenience and grab-and-go meals. These seem similar to the idea behind Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores, but people probably feel better about grabbing a salad from Whole Foods than the Amazon Fresh store … even though they’re the same company.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

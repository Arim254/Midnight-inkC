And how many of them were just using AI as an excuse to cover other problems?\nThat’s the question posed by a New York Times article on the trend of “AI-washing,” where companies will cite AI as the reason for layoffs that might actually be caused by other factors, like over-hiring during the pandemic.\nAI was the stated reason for more than 50,000 layoffs in 2025, with Amazon and Pinterest among the tech companies who blamed the technology for recent cuts.\nBut a Forrester report published in January argued, “Many companies announcing A.I.-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted A.I. applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘A.I.-washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future A.I. implementation.”\nMolly Kinder, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institute, noted that saying layoffs were caused by AI is a “very investor-friendly message,” especially when the alternative might mean admitting, “The business is ailing.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

That growth has come with some challenges, including a number of robotaxis that stalled at traffic lights during a widespread San Francisco blackout.\nWaymo has more than $350 million in annual recurring revenue, according to the FT.

The FCC recently gave SpaceX permission to launch an additional 7,500 Starlink satellites, but said it would “defer authorization on the remaining 14,988” proposed satellites.\nThere are currently around man-made 15,000 satellites orbiting the Earth, according to the European Space Agency, and they’re already creating issues with pollution and debris.\nThe filing also comes as Amazon — citing a lack of rockets — is seeking an extension on an FCC deadline to have more than 1,600 satellites in orbit. Meanwhile, SpaceX is reportedly considering a merger with two of Elon Musk’s other companies, Tesla and xAI (which already merged with X), ahead of going public.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Space\n\n"

If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. \n Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. \nPreviously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.\n“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an announcement. “That’s why we believe it’s so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company’s Neighbors app for Ring customers.\n\n\n\nAlongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it’s committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring’s network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSocial network UpScrolled, which gained prominence after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S. in January, has zoomed past 2.5 million users, the company’s founder Issam Hijazi said during Web Summit Qatar.\n“We launched about six months ago, and we grew to about 150,000 up until early January. And as of the last few days, we reached over one million users globally.  Now, starting today, we surpassed two-and-a-half million users globally,” Hijazi said.\nUpScrolled is a blend of Instagram and X, and claims to be inclusive of all voices. The company says that it allows for all kinds of content and doesn’t shadowban or censor people.\nDuring his speech, Hijazi called out big tech companies for being unethical and selling user data for profit, and accused social networks of suppressing pro-Palestinian content and choosing to censor users selectively.\n“They don’t care about selling your data to someone else if that means profit for them. And they don’t care about your mental health, as in they will design something just to keep you addicted to using that platform as long as it’s profitable for them,” he said.\nUsers on other platforms have complained about UpScrolled hosting a lot of porn and nudity. Hijazi noted that while the company won’t rely on amplification algorithms to boost or suppress certain views, it would have community guidelines in place to comply with laws in different regions. The company is gathering a team of experts to solidify its community guidelines and is also taking user feedback into account, he added.\nThe company hasn’t announced any funding publicly, but Hijazi said that the social network has been getting investor interest. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn January, TikTok switched to a new ownership structure in the U.S. with a consortium consisting of investors like Silver Lake and Oracle taking a majority share of the company while ByteDance retained 20% ownership. That change led to many users exploring other social networks. Apart from UpScrolled, AT Protocol-based Skylight also gained attention, crossing 380,000 users in the days following the finalization of the TikTok deal.\nWhile these social networks might have benefited from a short-term boost following organizational changes at TikTok, they will have to build features and a community to retain users. They will also have to form moderation policies and take content decisions that might not be popular with their user base, as Bluesky has discovered over the last few years.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:38 PM PST · February 1, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nTikTok, which is under new ownership in the U.S., said Sunday that it has restored service after outages last week that marred user experiences. The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.\nThe company blamed last week’s snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.\n“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok’s core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.\n\nIn January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a controlling 80% stake, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.\nFollowing the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features like posting, searching within the app, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it was working on solving the issue, but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.\nTikTok’s transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than 380,000 users in the week the deal was finalized. Upscrolled, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was downloaded 41,000 times within days of the TikTok deal’s finalization, according to analyst firm AppFigures.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

This comes months after the firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff. \n“During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,” Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line “Closing My a16z Chapter.” \n“Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,” he wrote.\nAmpadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu seems to have worked at a16z’s latest accelerator, Speedrun.\nAmpadu’s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.\nIts last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment. His full note below:\n\nI moved to the United States three months before my 11th birthday. One month later, I started 6th grade in a school more than 5,000 miles from my home, my friends, and everything familiar. Recently, my mom reminded me that my school required me to enroll as an English-as-a-Second-Language student. My memory immediately returned to how confused I felt. Even at 10 years old, I knew it made no sense that a kid from Ghana, an English-speaking country, was being asked to learn a language he already spoke fluently. \nThis was a systems requirement, a blanketed assumption about what students from certain places could or could not do. That same type of systemic assumption is what we set out to challenge through the Talent x Opportunity Initiative. The venture ecosystem often relies on proxies such as schools, networks, and prior credentials, which can obscure exceptional founders who do not follow the most common paths. TxO invested in and supported these overlooked founders to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity. \nDuring my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work. Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career. \nAs I move on to my next chapter, I leave with pride in what we built and gratitude for everyone who helped shape it. Thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief in what is possible. There is more work to do and I am excited to keep building.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

In late December and January, Grok was used to create at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women, according to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\nIn a statement, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said that it was lifting the ban after X sent a letter “outlining concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of misuse” (translation via The New York Times). \nAlexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, said the ban is only being lifted “conditionally” and could be reinstated if “further violations are discovered.”\nMalaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23.\nGrok’s deepfakes have spurred criticism and investigations — but only a few outright bans — from governments around the world. In the United States, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office was investigating xAI and had sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the company to take immediate action to end the production of these images.\nxAI appears to have taken some steps to restrict Grok’s capabilities, including limiting its AI image generation feature to paying subscribers on X. CEO Elon Musk has insisted, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” and said he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDocuments released by the Justice Department on Friday around the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein include at least 16 emails between Musk and Epstein in 2012 and 2013, with Musk asking to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island and wondering about the “wildest party on your island.” Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution in 2008.\nxAI, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks to merge with two of Musk’s other companies, SpaceX and Tesla, ahead of a SpaceX IPO.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

The two companies announced a plan in September through which Nvidia would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and also build 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure for the AI company.\nHowever, the WSJ said Huang has begun emphasizing that the deal is nonbinding, and that he’s also privately criticized OpenAI’s business strategy and expressed concerns about competitors like Anthropic and Google.\nIn addition, the WSJ reported that the two companies are rethinking their relationship — though that doesn’t mean cutting things off entirely, with recent discussions reportedly focusing on an equity investment of a mere tens of billions of dollars from Nvidia.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told the WSJ that the companies are “actively working through the details of our partnership,” adding that Nvidia “has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\nAccording to Bloomberg, reporters asked Huang about the report during a visit to Taipei. In response, he insisted that Nvidia will “definitely participate” in OpenAI’s latest funding round “because it’s such a good investment.”\n“We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang said. “I believe in OpenAI.

    "body": "\nWhat is and isn’t a weed that needs to be eliminated in the field is determined by the eyes of the farmer — and now, increasingly, by a new AI model from Carbon Robotics.\nSeattle-based Carbon Robotics, which builds the LaserWeeder — a robot fleet that uses lasers to kill weeds — announced a new AI model, the Large Plant Model (LPM), on Monday. This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.\nThe LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company’s machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company’s autonomous weed-killing robots.\nPaul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.\nThis process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it’s never seen it before.\n“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,’ and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There’s no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it’s looking at and the type of plant.”\nMikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta’s Oculus virtual reality headsets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis new model will reach the company’s existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot’s user interface.\nCarbon Robotics has raised more than $185 million in venture capital from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.\n“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it’s related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nSometimes, you might be sitting on a hot product and not know it until the market demands it.\nAfter launching as a digital business card that doubled as a lead capture tool for sales teams, Birmingham, Alabama-based Linq pivoted a few times before landing on an idea last year: helping businesses better communicate with their customers by upgrading from SMS (text) to iMessage and RCS.\nNow, Apple already lets businesses do this via its Messages for Business service, and Twilio has built a $18.26 billion business by helping companies text their customers. But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.\nLinq’s customers, though, wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.\nThe startup, founded by former Shipt executives Elliott Potter (CEO), Patrick Sullivan (CTO), and Jared Mattsson (President), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, co-founder and CEO Elliott Potter told TechCrunch.\nLinq was not content with its newfound product-market-fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage was a key catalyst in the company’s refocusing on the agentic market.\n“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPoke went viral at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.\nLinq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.\n“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”\nPotter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.\n“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”\nLinq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.\nTo continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. \nRosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will pull a Meta and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.\nPotter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”\n“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding Partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.” \n"

    "body": "\n“Melania,” a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, is exceeding box office expectations, with Sunday estimates suggesting it will make $7.04 million on its opening weekend.\nThe documentary is coming in third overall for the weekend, behind the Sam Raimi-directed thriller “Send Help” ($20 million) and “Iron Lung” ($17.8 million), a video game adaptation from YouTuber Mark Fischbach (better known as Markiplier).\nAmazon paid $40 million to acquire “Melania” and is reportedly spending $35 million to promote it. So even though the documentary is outperforming pre-release estimates predicting a $3 to $5 million opening weekend, it’s unlikely to make a profit in theaters.\nAmazon’s bid came in $26 million ahead of the next highest bidder, Disney, leading critics to suggest the deal had less to do with the film’s box office potential and more with winning over the Trump administration. Veteran film executive Ted Hope, who worked at Amazon from 2015 to 2020, told The New York Times that the film “has to be the most expensive documentary ever made that didn’t involve music licensing.”\n“How can it not be equated with currying favor or an outright bribe?” Hope said. “How can that not be the case?”\nThis is the first film directed by Brett Ratner since 2017, when multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and misconduct. (Ratner has denied those accusations.) Rolling Stone reports that two-thirds of the “Melania”‘s New York crew asked not to be formally credited in the film.\nWhile Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a preview screening of “Melania” at the White House last weekend, “Melania” was not screened in advance for critics, and the subsequent reviews have been brutal. The documentary currently sits at 7% on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating “overwhelming dislike,” and at 10% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNew York Times film critic Manohla Dargis described it as “a very circumscribed and carefully stage-managed chronicle of Mrs. Trump’s day-to-day life” during the 20 days before President Trump’s 2025 inauguration.\nIn a statement, Amazon MGM’s head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson described this weekend as “an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series,” which he predicted will have a “significant life” on Amazon’s Prime streaming service.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nJanuary was such a long month that it has already brought us five fresh European unicorns: from Belgium to Ukraine, several tech startups raised funding at valuations above the $1 billion threshold.\nBut before we take a closer look at who joined the club, two caveats.\nFirst: This count includes startups that may be incorporated elsewhere but have their roots or a large part of their team in Europe. Until a pan-European corporate structure exists (often called “EU Inc”), this split will remain common — and we’ve decided to overlook it. Take Lovable, which is incorporated in Delaware but cannot be dissociated from Stockholm’s startup scene.\nSecond: valuation doesn’t equal commercial success, and it is too early to tell whether all of these companies will achieve the kind of traction that Lovable has, with the company recently crossing $300 million in annual recurring revenue. But in the current climate, the fact that VCs were willing to invest in them at unicorn valuations is a strong signal of where the appetite is. \nWith these caveats out of the way, let’s dive in.\nAikido \nBelgium-based cybersecurity startup Aikido Security reached unicorn status with its $60 million Series B funding round. Valuing the company at $1 billion, the round was led by DST Global, with participation from PSG Equity, Singular, Notion Capital, and others.\nAccording to a press release, the funding will help Aikido enhance its platform, which was built to unify security across the entire software lifecycle and is already used by more than 100,000 teams globally. The company also reported “five-times revenue growth and nearly three-times customer growth” over the last year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a blog post, the startup celebrated this milestone and its significance. According to its team, “in an industry dominated by Palo Alto and Tel Aviv heavyweights, Aikido shows that Europe can build a world-class software security company and win globally.”\nCast AI \nCloud optimization company Cast AI is headquartered in Florida, but has Lithuanian roots and a major office in Vilnius — which explains why many now consider it to have become Lithuania’s fifth unicorn.\nCast AI’s valuation now exceeds $1 billion following a strategic investment from Pacific Alliance Ventures (PAV), the U.S.-based corporate venture arm of Korean conglomerate Shinsegae Group. In April 2025, Cast AI raised a $108 million Series C that had reportedly already brought the company close to unicorn territory.\nAlongside its latest funding round, the company also introduced OMNI Compute for AI, which aims to help users deploy more AI workloads on fewer GPUs and remove regional capacity constraints.\nHarmattan AI \nFrench defense tech company Harmattan AI was only founded in 2024, but is already worth $1.4 billion, according to its latest funding round. The $200 million Series B was led by Dassault Aviation, maker of the Rafale fighter jets, and also ties into a broader partnership.\nBefore securing this key partner, Harmattan AI had already signed agreements with the French and British ministries of defense and with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, amid growing appetite for autonomous defense aircraft.\nOsapiens \nGerman ESG software firm Osapiens raised a $100 million Series C led by Decarbonization Partners, a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek, which valued the company at over $1.1 billion.\nFounded in Mannheim in 2018, Osapiens now has more than 2,400 customers worldwide, including large multinational companies that rely on its platforms and tools for sustainability reporting and data compliance, but also to mitigate supply chain risks.\nPreply\nThe 14-year-old language learning marketplace Preply is now a unicorn valued at $1.2 billion — a milestone that also embodies Ukrainian resilience. The edtech company was founded in the United States, but its founders are Ukrainian and supporters of their home country, where Preply has a team of 150 employees.\nAccording to its CEO, Kirill Bigai, who believes in AI-enhanced learning, proceeds from the $150 million Series D round will help the startup hire more AI talent across its four offices — now located in Barcelona, London, New York, and Kyiv.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nA few years ago, Selina Tobaccowala’s daughter started leaving post-it notes around the house, telling everyone to “turn off the lights” and such.\nTobaccowala had just sold her last startup, Gixo, to OpenFit and was looking for a new challenge. “I saw the kids and thought, ‘Let me see if there’s something there on the sustainability and climate side,’” she told TechCrunch. “There had to be something more than like turning our lights off.”\nWithout a background in climate science or hardware engineering, she wasn’t sure where to start. So Tobaccowala turned to something she knew well: surveys. \n“Given my love of surveys, I surveyed a ton — a ton — of customers,” said Tobaccowala, who used to be president and CTO of SurveyMonkey. \nWhat she found was that people were struggling to figure out how to lower their utility bills. \n“When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,’” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.”\nTobaccowala co-founded HomeBoost to help people conduct their own home energy assessments. The company was part of the Startup Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTobacowalla (second from right) and the HomeBoost team.Image Credits:HomeBoost\nHomeBoost’s assessment process begins by mailing customers a BoostBox, a small kit that includes an infrared camera, a blacklight and a link to an app that takes customers through the process. As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded.\nUsing data from the scans, the app then automatically generates a report which suggests the most cost effective upgrades, including rebates based on where the person lives. \nIn many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. Utilities, which are incentivized to reduce end users’ energy use, often work with energy auditors to survey people’s homes to identify ways to trim their consumption. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said. \n“We talked to a bunch of consumers who’d gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,’” she said.\nThe HomeBoost app is cheaper and faster than an auditor, and it helps people feel more in control of the process, Tobaccowala said.\nHomeBoost charges customers $99, which is about a quarter the cost of a traditional, in-person assessment. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. Omaha Power, for example, pays for all but $19 of the cost, while Central Hudson will cover the entire cost if homeowners check out the BoostBox from a public library.\nBut not every homeowner wants to complete the survey process themselves, and not every auditor is a pushy salesperson. Dedicated auditors can spend between two and 10 hours surveying homes, collating data, and building reports, Tobaccowala said. For that, HomeBoost has developed a version of its app for professionals, allowing them to serve more customers.\nThe company is also testing a feature that will link homeowners with contractors who can follow through on the upgrades outlined in the report. For contractors, it’s another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home.\nBy bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowalla hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too. “It’s a very unique situation where everybody’s aligned to actually lower the utility bill, which in the net result is improvement on the climate,” she said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nAs the global race to build AI infrastructure accelerates, India has offered foreign cloud providers zero taxes through 2047 on services sold outside the country if they run those workloads from Indian data centers — a bid to attract the next wave of AI computing investment, even as power shortages and water stress threaten expansion in the South Asian nation.\nOn Sunday, India’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced (PDF) the proposal in the country’s annual budget, offering a tax holiday — effectively zero taxes — on revenues from cloud services sold outside India if those services are run from data centers in the country. Sales to Indian customers would have to be routed through locally incorporated resellers and taxed domestically, she told parliament. The budget also proposes a 15% cost-plus safe harbour for Indian data-center operators providing services to related foreign entities.\nThe announcement comes as U.S. cloud giants including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to add data-center capacity worldwide to support the surge in artificial-intelligence workloads, with India emerging as an increasingly attractive location for new investment. The country offers a large pool of engineering talent and growing demand for cloud services, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia for expanding compute infrastructure.\nIn October, Google said it would invest $15 billion to build an AI hub and expand data-center infrastructure in India, its largest commitment in the country to date, following a $10 billion commitment in 2020. Microsoft followed in December with plans to invest $17.5 billion by 2029 to expand its AI and cloud footprint, funding new data centers, infrastructure, and training programs. Amazon has also stepped up its spending in December, saying it would invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations.\nIndia’s domestic data-center sector is also ramping up to meet global demand. In November, Digital Connexion, a joint venture backed by Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, said it would invest $11 billion by 2030 to develop a 1-gigawatt, AI-focused data center campus in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, spanning about 400 acres in Visakhapatnam, is among the largest announced in India and underscores growing interest from both domestic and global investors in building AI-ready infrastructure in the country. Separately, Adani Group said in December it plans to invest up to $5 billion alongside Google in its AI data center project in the country.\nHowever, scaling up data center capacity in India may prove difficult, as patchy power availability, high electricity costs, and water scarcity pose key constraints for energy-intensive AI workloads. Those challenges could slow construction and raise operating costs for cloud providers.\n“The announcements on data centers signal that they are being treated as a strategic business sector rather than just back-end infrastructure,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of New Delhi-based The Quantum Hub, a public policy and tech consulting firm. The push is likely to attract more private investment and strengthen India’s position as a regional data and compute hub, though execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain, he added.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSagar Vishnoi, co-founder and director of Noida-based think tank Future Shift Labs, said India’s data-center power capacity is projected to surpass 2 gigawatts by 2026, up from just over 1 gigawatt currently, and could expand more than fivefold to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, driven by capital investments of more than $30 billion. While the budget signals clear intent to accelerate digital infrastructure and cloud computing, Vishnoi said allowing foreign cloud firms to earn profits tax-free until 2047 reflects a “strategic bet on global Big Tech,” even as India could produce its own technology champions over the next two decades.\nHe added that routing services to Indian users through reseller entities could leave smaller domestic players competing for thin margins, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives.\nThe federal budget also stepped up incentives to deepen India’s role in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, as the country seeks to move beyond assembly and capture more value in global supply chains. The federal government would launch a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, the finance minister said, focused on producing equipment and materials, developing full-stack domestic chip intellectual property, and strengthening supply chains, while backing industry-led research and training centers to build a skilled workforce.\nAdditionally, the Indian government has raised the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹400 billion (around $4.36 billion), from ₹229.19 billion (about $2.50 billion), after the program — launched in April 2025 — attracted investment commitments at more than double its original target, Sitharaman said.\nThis scheme offers incentives tied to incremental production and investment, reimbursing a portion of costs for companies that manufacture key components such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and other parts used in smartphones, servers, and data-center hardware. By linking payouts to actual output rather than upfront subsidies, the program is designed to draw global suppliers deeper into India’s electronics supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components — a long-standing criticism of the country’s manufacturing push.\nAlongside increasing the spending allocation for the electronics components scheme, the federal budget also proposed a five-year tax exemption starting in April for foreign companies supplying equipment and tooling to electronics toll manufacturers operating in bonded zones. The change is likely to benefit companies including Apple, which relies heavily on contract manufacturing in India and has previously been reported to have sought clarity from New Delhi on the tax treatment of high-end iPhone production equipment supplied to its partners.\nThe budget also sought to address vulnerabilities in critical minerals, as India grapples with tightening global supplies of rare earth materials used in electric vehicles, electronics devices, and defense systems. The finance minister said the federal government would support mineral-rich states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in establishing dedicated rare-earth corridors to promote mining, processing, research, and manufacturing. The move builds on a seven-year incentive program approved in late 2025 to boost domestic production of rare-earth magnets, as access to supplies from China — which dominates global output — has become more constrained.\nBeyond AI infrastructure and electronics manufacturing, the Indian government also moved to boost cross-border e-commerce, aiming to help smaller businesses tap global demand. The finance minister said the existing ₹1 million (around $11,000) value cap per consignment on courier exports would be removed, a move expected to benefit small manufacturers, artisans, and startups selling overseas through online platforms. The federal government would streamline the handling of rejected and returned shipments using technology, addressing a long-standing bottleneck for exporters, Sitharaman said.\nOverall, the latest measures emphasize India’s ambition to position itself as a long-term hub for global technology infrastructure, spanning cloud computing, electronics manufacturing, and critical minerals. The strategy aims to capitalize on surging AI demand and shifting supply chains. Nonetheless, its success will hinge on execution — from reliable power and water for data centers to sustained support for domestic innovation — as global companies and investors weigh whether India can translate policy incentives into durable leadership in the AI era.\n"

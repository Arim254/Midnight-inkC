The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.</p>\n<p>Put another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. </p>\n<p>Companies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.</p>\n</div>"

He promised this is the “first of many” such Nvidia AI factories that will be deployed across Microsoft Azure’s global data centers to run OpenAI workloads.</p>\n<p>Each system is a cluster of more than 4,600 Nvidia GB300 rack computers sporting the much-in-demand Blackwell Ultra GPU chip and connected via Nvidia’s super-fast networking tech called InfiniBand. (Besides AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also had the foresight to corner the market on InfiniBand when his company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/\">acquired Mellanox</a> for $6.9 billion in 2019.)</p>\n<p>Microsoft promises that it will be deploying “hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs” as it rolls out these systems globally.

In 2025, OpenAI has racked up, by some estimates, $1 trillion in commitments to build its own data centers.

These monster AI systems are also capable of running the next generation of models with “hundreds of trillions of parameters,” it said.</p>\n<p>We expect to hear more about how Microsoft is ramping up to serve AI workloads later this month.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stokespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stoke Space</a> announced a massive capital raise on Wednesday that might seem, at first glance, like just another bet on the commercial launch market. The details tell a different story.</p>\n<p>Led by billionaire Thomas Tull’s U.S. Innovative Technology (USIT), a fund that explicitly invests in technologies tied to national security, the $510 million Series D round underscores a larger shift in the launch industry. The old assumption was the winners of launch would be the companies that capture the lion’s share of commercial payloads.</p>\n<p>While there is still demand on the commercial side from private constellation developers and for emerging use cases like in-space manufacturing or lunar payloads, the center of gravity has shifted decisively toward defense.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, space startups were selling investors on visions of a rapidly expanding commercial market for weather monitoring, broadband, and remote-sensing satellites. Astra, for example, told investors in its 2021 SPAC deck that it would eventually launch hundreds of rockets per year to serve a growing small satellite market. Relativity Space pitched investors on a 3D printing revolution that would make rockets cheap enough to unlock large commercial demand.</p>\n<p>But there are only so many commercial payloads to fly, and only one company — SpaceX — has managed to consistently launch them cheaply and reliably.</p>\n<p>Defense, meanwhile, is on an opposite trajectory. </p>\n<p>Geopolitical shifts, like Russia’s war against Ukraine and growing competition in space from China, have created new tailwinds. The Pentagon’s new “Golden Dome” initiative, a multibillion-dollar project aimed at creating a layered missile defense shield over the continental United States, has flooded the aerospace ecosystem with lucrative new opportunities.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meanwhile, programs like the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) and the Space Development Agency’s missile-defense satellite constellation are promising years of predicable, high-value contracts. </p>\n<p>Launch startups have noticed. Their language, investors, and business models have realigned toward a single buyer: the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>In a press release, Stoke Space nods toward this reality, saying the new funding would strengthen “capability across the U.S. space industrial base.” Support from other new investors, like Washington Harbour Partners LP and General Innovation Capital Partners, further underscores “Stoke’s importance to national security and the U.S. industrial base,” the company said.</p>\n<p>Stoke’s recent wins highlight this reality. In March, it was one of a handful of launch providers selected for the NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program, which lets the company compete for up to $5.6 billion in launch contracts over the next decade. </p>\n<p>Other recent deals tell a similar story. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/firefly-leans-into-its-defense-ambitions-with-855m-scitec-acquisition/\">Firefly’s recent $855 million acquisition of SciTec</a> was framed by CEO Jason Kim as a move that enhanced the company’s “ability to support a growing number of defense missions.” Relativity’s new owner, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, just recently warned lawmakers that if China achieves superintelligence first, “it changes the balance of power globally in ways that we have no way of understanding, predicting or dealing with.”</p>\n<p>While his remarks weren’t about launch specifically, they sum up the broader sentiment across the space industry: America cannot lose in strategic domains like space and AI.</p>\n<p>In that context, USIT makes an obvious lead for the new round. Thomas Tull launched the fund in 2023 to fund technologies “relevant to the national interest.” </p>\n<p>Past investments are wide-ranging but related to national resilience, including defense startup Shield AI and Gecko Robotics. Stoke’s inclusion in that portfolio cements the new reality that space investment is squarely at the intersection of venture capital and defense budgets.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

Following the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">launch</a> of OpenAI’s invite-only, video-generating mobile app last week, Apple’s App Store was flooded with fakes that also proclaimed themselves to be “Sora” or “Sora 2” — the latter a reference to the underlying new AI video model that was released alongside the mobile app.</p>\n<p>These apps somehow made it past Apple’s App Review process. They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name that’s trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the app’s debut. </p>\n<p>According to research provided to TechCrunch upon our request by app intelligence platform <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>, there were over a dozen “Sora”-branded apps that went live on the App Store after the official app’s launch. Over half of them used “Sora 2” in their names specifically. (One of <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@gruber/post/DPZLd-IAF5j\" target=\"_blank\">those was spotted by</a> Apple blogger and pundit, John Gruber, who called it the “App Store scam of the week.”)</p>\n<p>Many of the apps were not newcomers, either. Some had been live on the App Store — sometimes using other names — since earlier in the year or even last year. The impostors, which include those live on Google Play as well, had seen around 300,000 collective installs to date, with north of 80,000 installs coming in after Sora’s official app launch. (OpenAI has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-hit-1m-downloads-faster-than-chatgpt/\">since announced</a> that Sora’s official mobile app has been downloaded 1 million times, for comparison.)</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the impostors had been updated just after OpenAI’s Sora app launch to capitalize on consumer demand and searches, often by changing their name. </p>\n<p>It’s unclear how these apps were able to slip past Apple’s reviewers; Apple did end up pulling many of them from its App Store, Appfigures said.</p>\n<p>Of the imposter apps, the largest one was named “Sora 2 – AI Video Generator” — an obvious attempt to game App Store searches for the keyword “sora.” It saw more than 50,000 installs after the launch of the official app.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As of the time of writing, a few Sora-branded apps are still live, despite the potential for consumer confusion. One, “PetReels — Sora for Pets,” has seen only a few hundred installs, however. Another one, “Viral AI Photo Maker: Vi-sora” is trying to squeeze the word Sora in there but hasn’t gained traction, either.</p>\n<p>Doing slightly better is the app using the branding “Sora 2” in its name (Sora 2 – Video Generator Ai). It’s pulled in north of 6,000 downloads and counting.</p>\n<p>Collectively, the apps earned more than $160,000 — decent money considering their short lives.</p>\n<p>Apple was asked for comment on how Sora-branded apps were able to go live and if these remaining Sora-branded apps would be removed.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-confirms-google-has-strategic-market-status-in-search-services\">designated</a> Google with a special status in the market for online search that would enable the regulator to enforce stricter regulations.</p>\n<p>The CMA has designated Google as having “strategic market status” in the search and search advertising markets, which means the company has such “a substantial and entrenched” position that it requires special regulations to ensure fair competition. </p>\n<p>“Google has had an unparalleled position in this digital activity for an extended period. Other traditional general search providers are significantly smaller than Google and have been for many years. Bing is the largest of these providers, but its current shares of queries and search advertising are both less than 5%. No traditional general search providers have materially grown relative to Google for at least fifteen years,” the CMA wrote in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68e8b643cf65bd04bad76724/Final_decision_-_strategic_market_status_investigation_into_Google_s_general_search_services.pdf\">report</a>.</p>\n<p>Although the designation does not mean that the CMA has found evidence of wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements, it does open the gates to launch further assessments and introduce interventions to change how Google runs its search services in the country, the CMA said. </p>\n<p>The designation covers Google’s search and online search advertising services; its AI-enabled search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode; and the ‘Discover’ feed and results, as well as the “Top Stories” and News tab. It does not cover the Google News app and website, and search syndication services are also out of scope. </p>\n<p>The CMA, however, noted that while Google’s Gemini AI assistant isn’t covered by the designation at the moment, it will review the scope of the designation given uncertainty over how the AI search market is evolving. </p>\n<p>The regulator said it would launch a consultation on possible interventions later this year.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The move follows a nine-month <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uks-cma-slaps-google-search-and-its-90-market-share-with-an-antitrust-investigation/\">investigation</a> into the company launched earlier this year after the U.K.’s new digital markets competition regime came into force in January. The CMA was looking to prove if Google is enabling weak competition and “barriers to entry and innovation in search”; whether the company prefers its own services over those offered by third parties; and if it uses consumer data without their explicit consent. </p>\n<p>The CMA’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6859810eeaa6f6419fade671/Roadmap_.pdf\">roadmap</a> of possible enforcement actions may include: enabling U.K. residents to choose and switch search engines via choice screens; implementing data portability systems; enforcing fair ranking of search results; ensuring proper attribution of publishers’ work in search; and enabling consent mechanisms for Google’s AI services.</p>\n<p>Google, for its part, says that any interventions following the designation would harm innovation in the U.K. “The UK enjoys access to the latest products and services before other countries because it has so far avoided costly restrictions on popular services, such as Search. Retaining this position means avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions, which have cost businesses an estimated €114 billion,” the company wrote in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/cma-designation-google-search/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Famed roboticist and iRobot founder Rodney Brooks has sounded the alarm on a humanoid robot investment bubble. He’s not the only one.</p>\n<p>In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rodneybrooks.com/why-todays-humanoids-wont-learn-dexterity/\">recent essay</a>, Brooks calls out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/famed-roboticist-says-humanoid-robot-bubble-is-doomed-to-burst/\">billions of venture dollars being poured into humanoid robot companies</a> like Figure. His take: despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won’t be able to learn dexterity — or the fine motor movements with hands– rendering them essentially useless.</p>\n<p>His take might surprise some, especially those VCs investing in the sector. But not to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/we-are-entering-a-golden-age-of-robotics-startups-and-not-just-because-of-ai/\">multiple robotics-focused VCs</a> and AI scientists, who have told TechCrunch in recent months that they don’t expect to see wide adoption of humanoid robots for at least a few years — if not more than a decade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-issues\">The issues</h2>\n<p>Fady Saad, a general partner at robotics-focused VC Cybernetix Ventures and former co-founder of MassRobotics, told TechCrunch that beyond sending humanoids into space in place of human astronauts, he doesn’t see a huge market yet.</p>\n<p>“People who probably haven’t seen humanoids before, or haven’t kind of been closely following what’s happening, they are impressed with what’s happening now in humanoids, but we continue to be a little bit conservative and skeptical about the actual use case and the actual revenues that will be generated,” Saad said.</p>\n<p>Saad is also concerned about safety, especially when humans and humanoid robots share the same space. Safety issues could arise from humanoids and humans working closely on a factory floor, or other industrial sites. Saad says those concerns mount when humanoids enter people’s homes — a goal many humanoid companies are working toward.</p>\n<p>“If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them,” Saad said. “This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to. The other thing is, how many people are comfortable with having a humanoid in their home sitting there? What if it got hacked? What if it went crazy at night and started breaking things?”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The timeline for this technology also isn’t clear — a crucial factor for VCs who have fund lifecycles and timelines to return capital to investors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-timeline\">The timeline</h2>\n<p>Sanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, told TechCrunch in August that while it’s hard to pin the development of humanoids to an exact timeline, she compared the current swell of interest to the excitement in the early days of self-driving cars.</p>\n<p>“I mean, look at self-driving cars, in 2017 and 2016, I mean it felt tangible, right?” Fidler said at the time. “It still took them quite a few years to really scale and even now, no one really scaled to the entire world, full autonomy. It’s hard. It’s really hard to go and fully delivery on that technology.”</p>\n<p>Nvidia chief scientist Bill Dally agreed in an interview with TechCrunch. Dally and Fidler’s comments are especially notable as Nvidia is also pouring money into developing the infrastructure for humanoid companies to follow.</p>\n<p>Seth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said while it can be easy to get excited as each new technological development happens, or the latest demo drops, humanoids are incredibly complicated. He added that it will be a while before they reach their full capabilities.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to do software releases to six degrees of freedom systems, what we’re talking about with some of these humanoids is 60 plus degrees of freedom systems,” Winterroth said, regarding a robot’s ability to move on 3-D axis. “Then you need to be able to have good unit economics around that solution, such that you’ve got strong gross margin, such that you can be building an enduring business. I think we’re pretty early.”</p>\n<p>In most cases, humanoid robots aren’t ready for the world yet, either.</p>\n<p>Tesla is a great example of the struggles companies are running into. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/\">company announced it was building its humanoid</a>, Optimus, back in 2021. The following year, Tesla said the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/our-top-4-tesla-ai-day-predictions/\">bot would be introduced in 2023</a>.</p>\n<p>That didn’t happen. When the bot was introduced in 2024 at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event — it was revealed later that the bots were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/tesla-optimus-bots-were-controlled-by-humans-during-the-we-robot-event/\">largely being controlled by humans</a> off scene. The company claims it will start selling the bots in 2026.</p>\n<p>Robotics startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">Figure, which was valued at $39 billion</a> in a September fundraise, has also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/04/06/figure-ai-bmw-humanoid-robot-partnership-details-reality-exaggeration/\">drawn skepticism regarding how many of its humanoids</a> the company has actually deployed, a claim the company staunchly defends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-working\">What is working</h2>\n<p>That doesn’t mean humanoids won’t have a future market or that the technology is not worth working on.</p>\n<p>Brooks himself said he doesn’t doubt that we will have humanoids in the future. But instead of what the market pictures when they hear humanoids, a robot with a human form, he predicts they’ll likely have wheels and other inhuman features and won’t be coming out for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>There are startups working on the dexterity technology Brooks is skeptical humanoids will be able to reach, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/tesla-sues-former-optimus-engineer-over-alleged-trade-secret-theft/\">Y Combinator-backed Proception</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.loomia.com/\">Loomia</a>, which built a kit that can help robotics companies start to incorporate touch into their machines.</p>\n<p>There are also numerous humanoid companies that are starting to take orders and gather interest in their robots. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kscale.dev/\">K-Scale Labs</a> received more than 100 pre-orders for its humanoid bot in the first five days, surprising even the founders, CEO Benjam Bolte told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Hugging Face has also seen strong demand from developers for its two humanoid bots. The company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/hugging-face-opens-up-orders-for-its-reachy-mini-desktop-robots/\">opened up pre-orders</a> for its smaller desktop version, the Reachy Mini, in July.  The reaction was palpable. Just five days after opening up orders on its Reachy Mini robots, Hugging Face had logged $1 million worth of sales. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The energy transition is seemingly under assault, with Congressional Republicans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/final-gop-bill-kneecaps-renewables-and-hydrogen-but-lifts-nuclear-and-geothermal/\">killing tax credits</a> for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/trumps-doe-proposes-cutting-billions-in-grants-for-gm-ford-and-lots-of-startups/\">cancel billions of dollars worth of grants</a>. </p>\n<p>But there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.</p>\n<p>Investor sentiment, which judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: people and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.</p>\n<p>This week, Brookfield announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. The infrastructure investor has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculating that clean energy was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.energyconnects.com/news/renewables/2021/november/green-investing-may-be-a-bubble-jeremy-grantham-says-but-he-s-doubling-down/\">entering a bubble</a>. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.</p>\n<p>Also this week, Energy Impact Partners announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>Climate tech — or whatever people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/21/if-climate-tech-is-dead-what-comes-next/\">are calling it these days</a> — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/climate-investors-canada-wildfires/\">too hard to ignore</a> for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Already, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\">Quilt</a>, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Investing trends that have developed the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/large-funds-are-too-invested-in-the-energy-transition-to-turn-back-now/\">nearly $1 trillion</a> to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/research-center/report/60abbe3b-aa8d-3f41-98e3-e9093b0f2d3a\">according</a> to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">openly opposed</a> to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2025\">revised downward</a> the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.</p>\n<p>Despite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expect to double by 2030, led by solar installations in the China, India, the EU, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/zeno-emerges-from-stealth-to-crib-teslas-master-plan-for-africa-and-beyond/\">Subsaharan Africa</a>.</p>\n<p>The IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dnv.com/eto2025/\">expect</a> that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. </p>\n<p>It won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has pushed back on local media reports suggesting it plans to open an office in India, with a general partner calling the coverage “entirely fake news.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Indian media outlets <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/a16z-andreessen-horowitz-india-expansion-bengaluru-ai-saas-startups-11759839746933.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that a16z was preparing to establish a physical presence in the country by setting up an office in Bengaluru. The reports, which cited unnamed sources, also said the firm was in the process of hiring a local partner.</p>\n<p>However, Anish Acharya, a Bay Area-based general partner at a16z who has spent the last six years with the firm, dismissed the reports. “As much as I adore India and the many impressive founders+investors in the region, this is entirely fake news!” he <a href=\"https://x.com/illscience/status/1976363023133725168\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n<p>When contacted, an a16z spokesperson confirmed Acharya’s statement and referred to his post.</p>\n<p>The denial comes as a16z appears to be scaling back some of its international ambitions. Earlier this year, the firm decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/documents-show-uk-wooed-a16z-for-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\">shut down its London office</a> — which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/london-lures-a16zs-first-international-office-with-predictable-crypto-regs/\" target=\"_blank\">opened in 2023</a> after the U.K. government reportedly spent <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/andreessen-horowitz-london-office\" target=\"_blank\">five years</a> trying to woo the powerhouse firm, according to the outlet Sifted. The closure came just 18 months after a16z set up shop, with the firm citing a shift in strategy and more favorable regulatory developments back home. The firm said, however, that it would continue to invest internationally through remote teams and local networks. Reports later indicated that several of its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/a16z-has-venture-scouts-scattered-across-europe/\">scouts were active across Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, India has not been a major focus for a16z — unlike other U.S. venture firms such as Accel, General Catalyst, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which have made deep inroads into the market. The firm’s only notable bet in India has been crypto exchange CoinSwitch, which it backed as part of the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/\" target=\"_blank\">$260 million funding round</a> in 2021.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, a16z was reportedly seeking to invest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\" target=\"_blank\">about $500 million in Indian startups</a>, though it has not made any major investments in the country since.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As TechCrunch has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\">previously noted</a>, a16z co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen delivered a talk at Stanford Graduate School of Business many years ago, saying while it is “extremely tempting” to back startups in emerging markets, it is also challenging for a venture fund to expand to more countries. Venture capital is a “very hands-on process of understanding the people you’re working with for both evaluating the company and work[ing] with the company,” he said at the time.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Days earlier, Oracle’s chief security officer, Rob Duhart, claimed in the same post — since scrubbed — that the extortion campaign was linked to previously identified vulnerabilities that Oracle patched in July, suggesting the hacks were over.</p>\n<p>But in a <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html\" target=\"_blank\">security advisory</a> published over the weekend, Oracle said the zero-day bug — named because Oracle had no time to fix the bug, as it was already being exploited by hackers — can be “exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.” </p>\n<p>The Russia-linked Clop ransomware and extortion gang has made a name for itself in recent years for mass-hacking campaigns, often involving the abuse of vulnerabilities unknown to the software vendor at the time they were exploited, to steal large amounts of corporate and customer data.

Reports about Netflix’s efforts to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/netflix-plans-to-bring-games-to-tv-and-let-players-use-their-iphones-as-video-game-controllers/\">bring its mobile games to televisions</a> began in early 2023. Later that year, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/netflix-launches-a-game-controller-app-for-playing-games-on-your-tv/\">launched a game controller app</a> for iOS devices. </p>\n<p>However, there hadn’t been much word about gaming on the big screen until now, but it looks like the wait is finally over.</p>\n<p>To use the new feature, go to the Games tab on the Netflix TV app, then pick a game and use your phone as the controller.</p>\n<p>Since launching mobile games four years ago, Netflix’s strategy has been somewhat varied. However, the recent move indicates a more serious commitment to expanding its gaming offerings, helping it compete more directly with major video game companies, beyond just mobile gaming rivals.</p>\n<p>Alongside the announcement, Netflix <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> the new slate of games it’s launching, all of which are party titles meant to be played in groups. </p>\n<p>These include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boggle Party</strong>: Up to eight players are timed to find words in a scrambled letter grid.</li>\n<li><strong>LEGO Party!</strong>: Four players compete in minigames and challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends</strong>: One person at this party secretly has no idea what everyone else is talking about. Figure out whose clues are fishy to unmask the crasher. </li>\n<li><strong>Pictionary: Game Night</strong>: Based on the classic group game, friends must guess what you’re drawing before time runs out. </li>\n<li><strong>Tetris Time Warp:</strong> Compete against friends for the best score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Launching group-focused games is a smart move for Netflix because it encourages more customers to participate. It also means users will stay engaged with the streaming service, even when they’re not watching a TV series or movie. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The addition of the five titles follows Netflix’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview\" target=\"_blank\">insight</a> into its current gaming strategy, which will now focus on four types of games, including party titles.</p>\n<p>The games are currently available on select TV screens in specific countries, and Netflix plans to expand their availability over time.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>As AI companies mature, the fight for high-quality data has become one of the most competitive areas in the industry, launching companies like Mercor, Surge, and, most prominently, Alexandr Wang’s Scale AI. But now that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/report-meta-taps-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-to-join-new-superintelligence-lab/\">Wang has moved on to run AI at Meta</a>, many funders see an opening — and are willing to fund companies with compelling new strategies for collecting training data.</p>\n<p>The Y Combinator graduate <a href=\"https://datacurve.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Datacurve</a> is one such company, focusing on high-quality data for software development. On Thursday, the company announced a $15 million Series A round, led by Mark Goldberg at Chemistry with participation from employees at DeepMind, Vercel, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The Series A comes after a $2.7 million seed round, which drew investment from former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.</p>\n<p>Datacurve uses a “bounty hunter” system to attract skilled software engineers to complete the hardest-to-source datasets. The company pays for those contributions, distributing over $1 million in bounties so far.</p>\n<p>But co-founder Serena Ge (pictured above with co-founder Charley Lee) says the biggest motivation isn’t financial. For high-value services like software development, the pay will always be far lower for data work than conventional employment — so the company’s most important edge is a positive user experience.</p>\n<p>“We treat this as a consumer product, not a data labeling operation,” Ge said. “We spend a lot of time thinking about: How can we optimize it so that the people we want are interested and get onto our platform?”</p>\n<p>That’s particularly important as the needs of post-training data grow more complex. While earlier models were trained on simple datasets, today’s AI products rely on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\">complex RL environments</a>, which need to be constructed through specific and strategic data collection. As the environments grow more sophisticated, the data requirements become both more intense for both quantity and quality — a factor that could give high-quality data collection companies like Datacurve an edge.</p>\n<p>As an early-stage company, Datacurve is focused on software engineering, but Ge says the model could apply just as easily to fields like finance, marketing, or even medicine.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“What we’re doing right now is we’re creating an infrastructure for post-training data collection that attracts and retains highly competent people in their own domains,” Ge says.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

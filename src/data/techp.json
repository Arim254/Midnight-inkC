TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.\nPer the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — has told reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.\nBeiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.\nOpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had “made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.” \nBeiermeister’s LinkedIn profile says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

For instance, users will be able to hide the notification area from prying eyes.\nReports suggest that the top phone in the lineup will run Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor in the U.S. and China. Samsung will likely opt for its own Exynos 2600 processor in other regions. The distinction matters, but increasingly less so. Snapdragon processors have historically outperformed Samsung’s Exynos chips in benchmarks and thermal efficiency, but the performance gap has been narrowing.\nAccording to a report from the tech site SamMobile, the S26 will also have a 5,100 mAh (milliamp-hour, a standard unit of battery capacity) battery and will support 60W wired charging along and 25W wireless charging.\nIn addition to phones, Samsung is likely to release updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. The company plans to update the design from the previous generation, which drew widespread comparisons to Apple’s AirPods.\nThe event will begin at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET/ 7 PM CET, and will be streamed live on Samsung’s website and its YouTube channel.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSamsung is offering a $30 promotional credit to anyone who pre-registers interest it its upcoming devices.

    "description": "Whatever the cause of the departures, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before.",
    "body": "\nMonday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It’s time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote in a late-night post on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”\nLess than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.\nOn their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.\nBy all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.\nThere are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.\nWhatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.\nIn short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nMasha Bucher, a Silicon Valley VC and founder of Day One Ventures, took to X this week to address news reports documenting her close business and personal relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Bucher’s name — primarily under her maiden name, Masha Drokova — appeared in the latest dump of Epstein files over 1,600 times, The San Francisco Standard reported.\n“He made me feel I could be safe from the regime, someone with power and connections who could shield me” from threats she associated with her home country Russia, which she said she feared after she obtained her U.S. green card, she wrote in the post.\n“I was naive; I didn’t dig deep enough early on,” she wrote about why she agreed to work with Epstein. “I believed his story that his earlier conviction was about sleeping with a girl who lied about her age and trusted validations from multiple investors and scientists.” She also apologized to her founders, team, and investors, saying that this situation has “caused pain I never intended.”\nThe files paint a picture of how Bucher — whose Silicon Valley career began in social media and public relations — agreed to become Epstein’s publicist in 2017, helping rehabilitate his reputation after his 2008 sex-trafficking conviction and setting up meetings between him and various journalists, as Forbes reported.\nThe documents show that Epstein supported and encouraged her in the early days of Day One Ventures. The firm has since grown substantially — as Bucher told TechCrunch, it closed its most recent fund, a $150 million third vehicle, in 2024, bringing its assets under management to $450 million.\nSome of the most salacious details from the emails involve Epstein giving her money and a Prada bag, and on one occasion, asking her for nude photos — though there’s no indication whether she complied — according to SFGate. Bucher is certainly a well-known VC in the Valley, having backed breakout companies like Superhuman, Remote, Worldcoin, and Truebill (which exited to Rocket Companies in 2021), as well as others like Valar Atomics.\nThe whole episode is a particularly awkward one for a VC whose whole spiel to founders is that she’s a PR expert who can help them with their public image. But it’s not Bucher’s first run-in with controversy.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen younger, Bucher was known in Russia as a member of Nashi, a pro-Putin youth group. In fact, she was featured in a 2012 documentary called “Putin’s Kiss” — named for the widely circulated moment in the country when she kissed Putin’s cheek — as CNN reported.\nIn her post on X, she said she has since given up her Russian passport, publicly denounced Putin, and met with some of Epstein’s victims.\nShe’s certainly not the only VC whose name has been found in the Epstein files, which is not surprising given how connected he was to some of the biggest names in tech. The documents do not indicate that Bucher broke laws. However, she was engaged in friendly correspondence with Epstein until just 11 days before his arrest in July 2019, Forbes reported. Epstein died in jail roughly one month later.\n"

    "body": "\nFacebook announced new AI-powered features on Tuesday designed to let users express themselves in more playful ways across the platform. The updates include animated profile pictures, photo-restyling tools for Stories and Memories, and the ability to add animated backgrounds to text posts.\n​As Meta works to maintain Facebook’s relevance among younger users on its flagship app, it’s likely betting that these new features will deliver a more personalized experience that appeals to Gen Z.\n​The new animated profile picture feature applies motion effects to static photos, making the subject appear to be waving, making a heart shape, or wearing a virtual party hat. To achieve the best results, Facebook recommends using a clear photo of a single person facing the camera. Photos can be pulled directly from a user’s camera roll or from images already on the platform. The company also plans to add more animation options throughout the year.\nImage Credits:Facebook\n​Facebook is also enhancing its Stories — short photo and video posts that disappear after 24 hours — and Memories — a feature that resurfaces posts from the same date in previous years — with “Restyle,” a tool that uses Meta AI to reimagine the look of user-uploaded images.\nAfter uploading a photo to Stories or selecting a Memory to share, users can tap Restyle and either enter a text-based prompt or select from preset themes, including anime, illustrated, glowy, ethereal, and more. There are also options to adjust moods, lighting, and colors, and to swap in new backdrops such as a beach or a cityscape. \n​To spice up text posts, Facebook is also gradually rolling out animated backgrounds. By clicking on the new rainbow “A” icon, users can choose from a variety of still and animated scenes, such as falling leaves or rolling ocean waves, to make their posts stand out in the feed. The company says that seasonal backgrounds are coming soon.\nImage Credits:Facebook\n​With around 2.1 billion daily active users, Facebook remains a social media giant. However, in recent years, it has struggled to attract and retain a younger demographic.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo address this, the platform has embraced new technology, including AI, and introduced a more youthful redesign. Other recent updates include a friends-only feed and the ability to use unique display names within Groups, similar to how Reddit handles usernames in its communities. The platform is also attempting to make its poke feature — a way to tap another user on the shoulder, so to speak — relevant again by launching a new dedicated button on users’ profiles that alerts the recipient to a poke via notifications.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSingapore’s government has blamed a known Chinese cyber-espionage group for targeting four of its top telecommunication companies as part of a months-long attack.\nIn a statement Monday, Singapore confirmed for the first time that the hackers, known as UNC3886, targeted the country’s telecoms infrastructure, including its largest companies: Singtel, StarHub, M1, and Simba Telecom. The government previously said that it was responding to an unspecified attack on its critical infrastructure.\nWhile the intruders were able to breach and access some systems, they did not disrupt services or access personal information, said K. Shanmugam, the country’s coordinating minister for national security.\nGoogle-owned cybersecurity unit Mandiant previously linked UNC3886 as an espionage group likely working on behalf of China. The Chinese government is known to conduct regular cyber-espionage operations, as well as prepositioning for disruptive attacks ahead of an anticipated invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing has routinely denied, per Reuters.\nUNC3886 is known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in routers, firewalls, and virtualized environments, where cybersecurity tools that are designed to spot malware cannot typically reach. The hacking group has targeted the defense, technology, and telecom industries across the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn the case of the attack on Singapore’s top telcos, Shanmugam said the hackers used advanced tools, like rootkits, to gain long-term persistence to their systems.\n“In one instance, they were able to gain limited access to critical systems but did not get far enough to have been able to disrupt services,” according to the government’s statement.\nPer Reuters, the telcos said in a joint statement that the companies regularly face distributed denial-of-service and other malware attacks. “We adopt defence-in-depth mechanisms to protect our networks and conduct prompt remediation when any issues are detected,” the statement read.\nThe attacks on Singapore’s telcos follow similar but distinctly different attacks on hundreds of telecoms companies around the world in recent years, including in the United States. Multiple governments have linked these attacks to a China-backed group dubbed Salt Typhoon.\nSingapore said the attack carried out by UNC3886 has “not resulted in the same extent of damage as cyberattacks elsewhere,” referring to the Salt Typhoon hacks. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

You’ll then be prompted to add your government ID numbers. Existing users can add their ID numbers and select which ones they want to monitor.\nOnce you’ve confirmed your details, Google will automatically monitor Search results and notify you if it finds results that contain your information. Google notes that removing this information from Search doesn’t remove it from the web entirely, but that doing so can help keep your information private. \nImage Credits:Google\nThe update is rolling out in the U.S. over the coming days. Google plans to bring it to additional regions in the future.\nThe tech giant also announced that it’s making it easier to request the removal of non-consensual explicit images on Search. Now, users just have to click on the three dots on an image, select “remove result,” then tap “It shows a sexual image of me.” Additionally, you no longer need to report images one by one, as you can now select and submit requests for multiple images from Search results using a single form. Users can also track the status of all requests in one place within the “Results about you” hub.\n“We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution,” Google wrote in its blog post. “For added protection, the new process allows you to opt-in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult.",
    "body": "\nOn Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.\nAccording to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”\nWhat Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”  \nIt isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.\nThe moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time. \nIt’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.\nRationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.\nWhether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. \nAs Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon.”\nThat legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nThe AI industry’s pursuit of licensable content has been a messy affair, filled with lawsuits and accusations of copyright infringement. Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.\nThe Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.\nReached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.” \nAmazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.\nThe move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.  \nThose efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.\nMedia publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Rivian\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11:38 AM PST · February 10, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThere’s been a lot of pushback on electronic door handles lately, as multiple carmakers — especially Tesla — have been accused of making manual door releases too hard to find and access during an emergency. Rivian is one of the companies that reportedly decided to change this on its upcoming R2 SUV, and a spate of first-look videos released Tuesday finally give us a look at what the company has changed.\nFirst off, the front doors open from the inside in the same way as in the existing R1 vehicles. There is an electronic button that opens the door, and there’s a manual door-release latch tucked into the front part of the interior handle.\nThe rear doors also have an electronic button, as well as a change to the rear manual release. \nOn R1 vehicles, passengers have to first pull a panel off the door to access a “release cord” that operates the manual latch. On the new R2 SUV, Rivian moved this release cord to that same front-of-the-handle position as the front seat manual releases — though it’s still tucked behind a piece of plastic that must be popped out, making it slightly harder to access than the front door manual releases.\nThe R2 SUV isn’t set to go into production for another few months, so the company has not put out proper instructions on how to access this release. But here’s an image from a new video published by JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson:\nImage Credits:JerryRigEverything (screenshot)\nHe doesn’t pull out the actual cord, but it’s the best illustration I’ve seen so far of what passengers will need to do if they are in an R2 that has lost power for whatever reason, limiting the vehicle’s electronic door release. \nThe manual release is still behind a piece of plastic, and it’s not the most obvious or accessible way to open a door from the inside. But it’s at least in a more logical spot than just being hidden behind a panel.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese kinds of situations don’t happen often. But when they do, it’s typically during a major crash. That means every moment can mean the difference between life and death.\nRivian is not alone in reworking how hard it is to access the manual releases. The most high-profile example is Tesla. Bloomberg News found at least 15 deaths in crashes where there is evidence that occupants (or rescuers) were unable to open the doors. The company has said it will change how it designs its handles in order to address the problem.\nAnd electronic door latches can present other issues. Last year, Ford had to issue a recall to fix a power-delivery problem for the electronic door latches on the Mustang Mach-E.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nModern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats — a slow and costly process that’s increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere. \nAI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nLed by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.\nShay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.  \n“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”\nLike so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which Intel acquired for $650 million in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”\nThat pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBrasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which Cisco acquired in 2024 for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI. \n“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said. \nHowever, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”\nVega’s approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multimillion-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart.\n“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nIndia has ordered social media platforms to step up policing of deepfakes and other AI-generated impersonations, while sharply shortening the time they have to comply with takedown orders. It’s a move that could reshape how global tech firms moderate content in one of the world’s largest and fastest growing markets for internet services.\nThe changes, published (PDF) on Tuesday as amendments to India’s 2021 IT Rules, bring deepfakes under a formal regulatory framework, mandating the labeling and traceability of synthetic audio and visual content, while also slashing compliance timelines for platforms, including a three-hour deadline for official takedown orders and a two-hour window for certain urgent user complaints.\nIndia’s importance as a digital market amplifies the impact of the new rules. With over a billion internet users and a predominantly young population, the South Asian nation is a critical market for platforms like Meta and YouTube, making it likely that compliance measures adopted in India will influence global product and moderation practices.\nUnder the amended rules, social media platforms that allow users to upload or share audio-visual content must require disclosures on whether material is synthetically generated, deploy tools to verify those claims, and ensure that deepfakes are clearly labeled and embedded with traceable provenance data.\nCertain categories of synthetic content — including deceptive impersonations, non-consensual intimate imagery, and material linked to serious crimes — are barred outright in the rules. Non-compliance, particularly in cases flagged by authorities or users, can expose companies to greater legal liability by jeopardizing their safe-harbor protections under Indian law.\nThe rules lean heavily on automated systems to meet those obligations. Platforms are expected to deploy technical tools to verify user disclosures, identify, and label deepfakes, and prevent the creation or sharing of prohibited synthetic content in the first place.\n“The amended IT Rules mark a more calibrated approach to regulating AI-generated deepfakes,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner at New Delhi-based policy consulting firm The Quantum Hub. “The significantly compressed grievance timelines — such as the two- to three-hour takedown windows — will materially raise compliance burdens and merit close scrutiny, particularly given that non-compliance is linked to the loss of safe harbor protections.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAprajita Rana, a partner at AZB & Partners, a leading Indian corporate law firm, said the rules now focus on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online information, while carving out exceptions for routine, cosmetic, or efficiency-related uses of AI. However, she cautioned that the requirement for intermediaries to remove content within three hours once they become aware of it departs from established free-speech principles.\n“The law, however, continues to require intermediaries to remove content upon being aware or receiving actual knowledge, that too within three hours,” Rana said, adding that the labeling requirements would apply across formats to curb the spread of child sexual abuse material and deceptive content.\nNew Delhi-based digital advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said the rules risk accelerating censorship by drastically compressing takedown timelines, leaving little scope for human review and pushing platforms toward automated over-removal. In a statement posted on X, the group also raised concerns about the expansion of prohibited content categories and provisions that allow platforms to disclose the identities of users to private complainants without judicial oversight.\n“These impossibly short timelines eliminate any meaningful human review,” the group said, warning that the changes could undermine free-speech protections and due process.\nTwo industry sources told TechCrunch that the amendments followed a limited consultation process, with only a narrow set of suggestions reflected in the final rules. While the Indian government appears to have taken on board proposals to narrow the scope of information covered — focusing on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online material — other recommendations were not adopted. The scale of changes between the draft and final rules warranted another round of consultation to give companies clearer guidance on compliance expectations, the sources said.\nGovernment takedown powers have already been a point of contention in India. Social media platforms and civil-society groups have long criticized the breadth and opacity of content removal orders, and even Elon Musk’s X challenged New Delhi in court over directives to block or remove posts, arguing that they amounted to overreach and lacked adequate safeguards.\nMeta, Google, Snap, X, and the Indian IT ministry did not respond to requests for comments.\nThe latest changes come just months after the Indian government, in October 2025, reduced the number of officials authorized to order content removals from the internet in response to a legal challenge by X over the scope and transparency of takedown powers.\nThe amended rules will come into effect on February 20, giving platforms little time to adjust compliance systems. The rollout coincides with India’s hosting of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi from February 16 to 20, which is expected to draw senior global technology executives and policymakers to the country.\n"

    "body": "\nHauler Hero has picked up fresh funds as demand for its AI-powered waste management software continues to pile up.\nThe New York-based startup raised $16 million in a Series A round led by Frontier Growth with participation from K5 Global and Somersault Ventures, among others, TechCrunch has learned. Hauler Hero has raised more than $27 million in venture capital, to date.\nHauler Hero has developed an all-in-one software platform for waste management companies that covers a variety of functions, including customer relationship management, billing, and routing. And now, like so many other software companies, Hauler Hero plans to offer AI agents to its customers as well. \nHauler Hero was co-founded in 2020 by CEO Mark Hoadley and brother-in-law Ben Sikma, who encountered outdated software while working on mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Their aim was to bring waste management into the modern era.\n“All of the existing software in the space, they were clunky, old,” Hoadley told TechCrunch in 2024. “Sometimes we’d talk about how this one reminds us of the Oregon Trail, this reminds us of the cell phone Michael Douglas used in ‘Wall Street.’ They’re very clunky and antiquated.”\nThe numbers suggest the company has had some success; Hauler Hero said it has helped facilitate 35 million trash pickups since inception in 2020. And it continues to grow, according to Hoadley, who told TechCrunch the company has doubled its head count, revenue, and customer base since announcing its seed round in late 2024.\nHauler Hero has added new features to its platform since its seed round, Hoadley said. The most notable is a product that captures images from third-party cameras on garbage trucks and sends them directly to a software command center. This information helps waste management companies confirm pickups, verify billing, and keep a better eye on their distributed fleet, according to the company.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHoadley said some sanitation workers, and their respective unions, don’t love this tech upgrade. But he added that most unions prevent the footage from being used against the drivers for disciplinary measures, for example, and that the images can actually help reduce liability for drivers in accidents or if they are accused of missing a pickup.\n“Think of it as like running a factory with no roof and no visibility into what’s happening in that factory,” Hoadley said. “If you don’t have visibility into what’s happening out there, it’s very hard to have quality control. And the quality control in this case is what was out there, was it picked up?”\nA trio of AI agents\nHauler Hero is now working to develop and deploy a set of three AI agents. One, Hero Vision, is focused on automatically identifying service issues and revenue opportunities. Hero Chat is a chatbot for customer inquiries. Hero Route will use route data to automatically adjust routes to make them more efficient.\n“There’s an enormous amount of data in our system about pickups, work orders, billing information, and if you give these agents an understanding of your data model, you can just go tell them, hey, go build me a chart,” Hoadley said.\nHauler Hero plans to use some of its recent funding to commercialize these agents in addition to bulking up its offerings for municipal entities, a growing group of the company’s customers.\n“It wasn’t something that I necessarily thought was going to be part of this journey,” Hoadley said about working with these public entities. “It kind of came organically as many things do. We just had inbound from some municipalities and eventually we sold one of them and then we sold another.”\nHoadley said that he thinks some of that demand is driven by the fact that its two main competitors, Routeware and Wastech, merged in 2024, leaving government entities with little choice of providers to work with.\nHoadley said the company is now focused on fine-tuning and scaling its product — and maybe some new additions as well.\n“We’re going to continue to chart the course for the next decade of being at the cutting edge of delivering value for customers, leveraging all the latest tools,” Hoadley said. “There’s a lot more fun things and valuable things that we can do for our customers, and we’re really excited about it.”\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect which investors participated in the Series A. \n"

    "body": "\nGoogle handed over a trove of personal data about a student and journalist to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in response to a subpoena that had not been approved by a judge, according to a report by The Intercept. \nThe search and advertising tech giant provided ICE with the usernames, physical addresses, and an itemized list of services associated with the Google account of Amandla Thomas-Johnson, a British student and journalist who briefly attended a pro-Palestinian protest in 2024 while attending Cornell University in New York. \nGoogle also turned over Thomas-Johnson’s IP addresses, phone numbers, subscriber numbers and identities, and credit card and bank account numbers linked to his account. \nThe subpoena, which reportedly included a gag order, did not include a specific justification for why ICE was requesting Thomas-Johnson’s personal data, but the student previously said that the demand for his data came within two hours of Cornell informing him that the U.S. government had revoked his student visa. \nThis is the latest example of how the U.S. government is using a controversial type of legal request, called an administrative subpoena, to demand that tech companies turn over the private data of individuals who have been critical of the Trump administration. This has included anonymous Instagram accounts that share information about ICE presence and raids, as well as people who criticize or protest Trump and his policies.\nICE and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \nAdministrative subpoenas are issued directly by federal agencies without the intervention of a judge. These legal demands cannot compel companies to turn over the contents of a person’s email accounts, online searches, or location data, but can request metadata and other identifiable information, such as email addresses, in an attempt to de-anonymize the owner of a certain online account. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUnlike a court order, tech companies are under no obligation to provide someone’s data after receiving an administrative subpoena.\nLast week, the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation sent a letter to Amazon, Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Reddit, demanding that the companies stop giving data to the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, in response to administrative subpoenas.  \n“Based on our own contact with targeted users, we are deeply concerned your companies are failing to challenge unlawful surveillance and defend user privacy and speech,” read the letter. \n“We call on companies in receipt of such subpoenas to insist that DHS seek court confirmation that their demands are not unlawful or unconstitutional prior to companies disclosing any user information. We also urge you to notify users about demands for their information with meaningful time to challenge subpoenas on their own,” it reads.\nThomas-Johnson told The Intercept that, “we need to think very hard about what resistance looks like under these conditions…where government and Big Tech know so much about us, can track us, can imprison, can destroy us in a variety of ways.”\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

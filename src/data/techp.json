Investors in the round include chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and VC firms SV Angel, Google Ventures and Laurene Powell Jobs’s firm Emerson Collective. \nThe megadeal for the three-month-old company follows a trend of investors throwing money at startups founded by breakaways of major AI labs. Humans&’s founders include Andi Peng, a former Anthropic researcher who worked on reinforcement learning and post-training of Claude 3.5 through 4.5; Georges Harik, Google’s seventh employee who helped build its first advertising systems; Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, two former xAI researchers who helped develop the Grok chatbot; and Noah Goodman, a Stanford professor of psychology and computer science. \nHumans&’s 20-odd employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company. The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other – think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use. \nIn order to build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans& hopes to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” per the company’s webpage. The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development. \nTechCrunch has reached out for comment. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n\n"

Discovery (WBD) shareholders, Netflix is now offering cash for shares of the company, revising the cash-and-stock deal it had struck with WBD’s board earlier. \nHowever, the streaming giant is still offering the same $27.75 the companies had agreed on for WBD’s movie studio and streaming assets, and the deal continues to value the company at $82.7 billion.\nThe new offer serves to simplify the deal structure, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday, “provides greater certainty of value,” and speeds up the timeline for a shareholder vote. Netflix said it would finance the deal with cash, debt, and “committed financing.”\nThe change-up comes as rival suitor Paramount Skydance has intensified efforts to win over WBD’s shareholders with its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for the entirety of the company, including securing a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. \nParamount, which has been trying to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for months, last week sued the company for more information on Netflix’s offer and said it would nominate new members to Warner Bros.’ board, after WBD rebuffed its offer. The company also sought to expedite the lawsuit, but the court rejected that effort.\nNetflix, for its part, had until now stuck to its original cash-and-share offer, enjoying the full backing of WBD’s board, which has resolutely rejected Paramount’s bids. WBD has argued that selling to Netflix would make for a better deal because the streaming giant has the capital to pay, and has said that Paramount’s deal poses “materially more risk,” as it would saddle the combined company with $87 billion in debt.\nWarner Bros. has also called into question Paramount’s ability to function after the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating, and has raised concerns about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by the acquisition.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWarner Bros.

Restaurants partner with Claim to create promotions, boost foot traffic, and track performance insights through the Claim dashboard. \nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, however Claim raised a total or $20 million, it said when it raised its $12 million Series A in October, 2024. Pitchbook estimated its valuation at $62 million. \nGrubhub says the acquisition will give restaurants on its platform access to Claim’s customer acquisition and retention tools, while Grubhub diners will receive additional savings and rewards for dining out.\n“By combining a delightful rewards experience and powerful machine learning models, we match restaurants with their next regulars. Claim is a game-changer for these businesses, and joining Grubhub marks an exciting new chapter as we scale to reach millions more diners and thousands of restaurants,” Claim CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz in a statement.\nGrubhub told TechCrunch that all members of the Claim team were extended offers to join Grubhub. \nUnder Grubhub, Claim will enable more restaurants to connect with consumers through personalized rewards.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 AM PST · January 18, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nIf you’re at all concerned about privacy, the rise of AI personal assistants can feel alarming. It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI already testing advertising, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.\nA new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. Confer is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.\nFor Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.\n“It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.” \nEnsuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert. \nFirst, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using the WebAuthn passkey system. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) On the server side, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in. \nThe result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nConfer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The streaming company said the option will be available with the premiere of its live-streamed talent show “Star Search” on January 20.\nSubscribers will be able to either pick a selection from a multiple-choice menu or rate someone’s performance on a scale of five stars. Votes can be cast using either a TV remote or the Netflix app. \nNetflix said that the feature will work globally, and on the backend, the platform will tally votes in real-time. Viewers will have a limited time to vote, and once that time has lapsed, additional votes won’t count. That means if you’re watching the show later, you can’t participate in the voting. \nImage Credits: Netflix\nThe streamer started testing live voting in August 2025 with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.” During TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, the company’s CTO, Elizabeth Stone, confirmed that the company would soon launch the feature widely.\n“If you’re sitting at home watching ‘Star Search’ on your TV, you’ll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn’t advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone had said.\n“So it’s just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they’re part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”\nNetflix has heavily leaned in to live content with shows like “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” and “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” along with sports broadcasts, including the NFL Christmas special and WWE shows. In October, the company launched interactive games that people can play on their smart TVs.

    "body": "\nOne of the more prominent alternative app stores that emerged in the EU as a result of the region’s Digital Markets Act is shutting down. The store, Setapp Mobile, from the Ukrainian-based developer MacPaw, first launched in September 2024, offering dozens of apps across categories like productivity, finance, video, photo, creativity, and more.\nIts model offered consumers access to all of Setapp’s mobile apps through a $9.99 monthly subscription, provided the user’s Apple ID was associated with an EU member state.\nNow, the company says all applications will be removed from Setapp Mobile by the end of the sunset date, February 16, 2026. Applications that are available on Setapp Desktop will not be affected, the company told TechCrunch. \nThe news of the shutdown, announced on Setapp’s support site, was first spotted by MacRumors. \nMacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.\nThe “complex business terms” being referenced here are Apple’s complicated set of fees for apps operating under its new business terms in the EU, which include a controversial Core Technology Fee that charges developers €0.50 for each first annual install over one million in the past 12 months. \nThe tech giant revised its fee structure last year to avoid further penalties for noncompliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), but instead of simplifying the fees, it made them more complex.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne result of these constant changes is that developers can’t properly plan how to grow and monetize their business. It also suggests the fees, as they stand, don’t make running an alternative app store in the EU a viable option.\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch, Setapp said it found its business model was not “viable,” as the commercial conditions continued to change. The statement reads:\n\n“Setapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces – creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision. As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model. While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile and let down our user base and developer community in the EU, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations.”\n\nThere are still other alternative app stores operating in the EU, including, most notably, the Epic Games Store from the maker of Fortnite, and the open source AltStore.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nMeta’s Oversight Board is tackling a case focused on Meta’s ability to permanently disable user accounts. Permanent bans are a drastic action, locking people out of their profiles, memories, friend connections, and, in the case of creators and businesses, their ability to market and communicate with fans and customers.\nThis is the first time in the organization’s five-year history as an oversight body that permanent account bans have been a subject of the Oversight Board’s focus, the organization notes.\nThe case being reviewed isn’t exactly one of an everyday user. Instead, the case involves a high-profile Instagram user who repeatedly violated Meta’s Community Standards by posting visual threats of violence against a female journalist, anti-gay slurs against politicians, content depicting a sex act, allegations of misconduct against minorities, and more. The account had not accumulated enough strikes to be automatically disabled, but Meta made the decision to permanently ban the account.\nThe Board’s materials didn’t name the account in question, but its recommendations could impact others who post content that targets public figures with abuse, harassment, and threats, as well as users who have their accounts permanently banned without receiving transparent explanations.\nMeta referred this specific case to the Board, which included five posts made in the year before the account was permanently disabled. The Board says it’s looking for input about several key issues: how permanent bans can be processed fairly, the effectiveness of its current tools to protect public figures and journalists from repeated abuse and threats of violence, the challenges of identifying off-platform content, whether punitive measures effectively shape online behaviors, and best practices for transparent reporting on account enforcement decisions.\nThe decision to review the particulars of the case comes after a year in which users have complained of mass bans with little information about what they did wrong. The issue has impacted Facebook Groups, as well as individual account holders who believe that automated moderation tools are to blame. In addition, those who have been banned have complained that Meta’s paid support offering, Meta Verified, has proven useless to aid them in these situations.\nWhether the Oversight Board has any real sway to address issues on Meta’s platform continues to be debated, of course. \nThe board has a limited scope to enact change at the social networking giant, meaning it can’t force Meta to make broader policy changes or address systemic issues. Notably, the Board isn’t consulted when CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to make sweeping changes to the company’s policies — like its decision last year to relax hate speech restrictions. The Board can make recommendations and can overturn specific content moderation decisions, but it can often be slow to render a decision. It also takes on relatively few cases compared to the millions of moderation decisions that Meta makes across its user base.\nAccording to a report released in December, Meta has implemented 75% of more than 300 recommendations the Board has issued, and its content moderation decisions have been consistently followed by Meta. Meta also recently asked for the policy advisors’ opinion on its implementation of the crowdsourced fact-checking feature, Community Notes.\nAfter the Oversight Board issues its policy recommendations to Meta, the company has 60 days to respond. The Board is also soliciting public comments on this topic.\nCorrection: The public comments can be submitted anonymously; this post was updated after publication to reflect this.  \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSpaceX didn’t properly inspect a hydraulic crane that had recently been repaired before it collapsed at the company’s Starbase, Texas facility last June, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nAs a result, the federal safety agency has hit SpaceX with seven “serious” violations related to its investigation, which it opened one day after the crane collapse. OSHA issued the maximum financial penalty it can levy on six of those “serious” violations, giving Elon Musk’s spaceflight company a combined fine of $115,850.\nOSHA’s probe is still open according to the agency’s website. It’s still unclear whether any workers were harmed in the accident. SpaceX is able to contest the penalties; the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe penalty and violations come as SpaceX is set to ramp up activity at the Starbase facility, partly fueled by a race to fulfill President Donald Trump’s goal of returning astronauts to the Moon by the end of his second term. The company has clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to perform as many as 25 Starship launches in Texas this year. At the same time, it is undergoing rapid expansion of the launch complex to meet Musk’s grand ambitions of building thousands of Starship rockets per year.\nSpaceX has had a long history of injuries at the South Texas launch complex. A 2023 Reuters report uncovered dozens of previously-unreported injuries — and one employee death — that happened as the facility was built up across the last decade. A TechCrunch analysis of OSHA data last year showed SpaceX has a much higher injury rate at the Starbase site than at other facilities run by the company, or those of its industry peers.\nAccidents keep happening, too. In December, an employee of a SpaceX subcontractor filed a lawsuit against SpaceX after he was allegedly crushed by a large metal support dropped from a crane. OSHA is also investigating that accident, as TechCrunch first reported. \nThe crane collapse at the center of the new OSHA penalty happened on June 24, 2025. SpaceX employees at a Starbase test site were cleaning up debris from a Starship explosion just four days prior. Footage captured by LabPadre, which posts live streams of the Starbase site, showed a crane buckling under the weight of a large piece of the exploded Starship.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to the new citations posted to OSHA’s website, one employee was using a Grove RT9150E crane to lift the debris while another used an excavator’s bucket to inspect it, in hopes of determining the cause of the explosion.\nThat Grove crane had recently been repaired, according to the citations, and returned to SpaceX “without the employer ensuring repairs met manufacturer’s criteria via an inspection by a qualified person.” It is not clear why the crane was repaired, but another citation states a Grove RT9150E crane at the test site had a computer that would not start until “multiple attempts” were made.\nOSHA claims SpaceX was either not performing or not documenting monthly inspections on the Grove crane, and that it hadn’t been inspected “within the last 12 months.” SpaceX did not perform monthly inspections of the wire rope being used to move debris either, according to OSHA. And OSHA claims rigging equipment used at the site was missing manufacturer-prescribed markings that are supposed to detail a “safe working load.” \nAs part of its investigation, OSHA also found that an employee had been operating a Tadano 90-ton crawler crane to move debris at the test site with an expired certification from the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nTechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images. \nThe product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.  \nAfter learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.\nThe technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch. \nHe hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,  \nBustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis. \nBustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.  \nThe CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.  \nNow with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies’ next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health. \n“We’re positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.  \nThis piece was updated to correct the spelling of the co-founder’s name.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSequoia Capital is reportedly joining a blockbuster funding round for Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, according to the Financial Times. It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.\nWhy? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.\nThe timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against a high-profile lawsuit by Musk, Altman addressed earlier rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.\nAccording to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, which are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.\nThe Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”\nWhile Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Former longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.\nSequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. As we reported in 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia forfeited its $21 million investment, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where the firm’s global steward, Roelof Botha, was forced aside in a surprise vote this fall just days after sitting down with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal — taking over.\nAnthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year. We’ve reached out to Sequoia Capital for comment.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nA report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggests that Meta’s Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. While X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.\nSimilarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices.\nThis appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors. Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general to open an investigation into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, like the UK, EU, India, Brazil, and many more.\nThe drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky to see an increase in app installs in recent days.\n\nInstead, Threads’ boost in daily mobile usage may be driven by other factors, including cross-promotions from Meta’s larger social apps like Facebook and Instagram (where Threads is regularly advertised to existing users), its focus on creators, and the rapid rollout of new features. Over the past year, Threads has added features like interest-based communities, better filters, DMs, long-form text, disappearing posts, and has recently been spotted testing games.\nCombined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.\nAccording to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had reached over 400 million monthly active users. The company subsequently reported in October of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb last summer reported that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025. \nRelatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.\nIn addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe weather in Las Vegas wasn’t looking good. The plan had been that each employee of YC-backed Bucket Robotics would carry parts of their booth in their luggage to the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. But CEO and founder Matt Puchalski didn’t want to take the chance that one (or all) of their flights would be delayed. So he rented a Hyundai Santa Fe and packed it up. \n“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.  \nIt took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company’s first-ever CES.\nSan Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.\nPart of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.\nAn engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford’s subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.\nAt those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.\nBut I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference’s “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.\nPuchalski’s verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.\nStarted as part of YC’s Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing. \nOne example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It’s a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.\nBut it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.\n“It’s deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said. \nBucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.\nThere’s no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said. \nThis has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.  \nWhen the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup’s tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.  \nMore importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he’s spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors. \nCES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.  \nAs for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn’t see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.\nAnd besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.\n“So when we go to our customers, it’s incredibly exciting,” he said. \n"

    "body": "\nIn a sign of the demand, or hype, for AI startups, Emergent, an Indian startup building an AI “vibe-coding” platform, has raised $70 million less than four months after it raised a $23 million Series A.\nThe Series B round was jointly led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, and values the startup at $300 million post-money, sources with knowledge of the deal told TechCrunch. The startup was previously valued at $100 million post-money, another source told TechCrunch.\nProsus, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Together, and Y Combinator also participated. Emergent has now raised $100 million within seven months of its launch.\nThe funding comes as Emergent claims $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and more than 5 million users across 190-plus countries. The startup said it is targeting ARR of more than $100 million by April 2026.\nLike other vibe-coding platforms, Emergent uses AI agents to help users design, build, test and deploy full-stack web and mobile apps. It targets entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to ship products without having to hire large engineering teams.\n“We continue to see massive demand across our top geographies — the U.S., Europe and India — and we’ll continue to expand deeper into these markets,” founder Mukund Jha told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s recently launched mobile app-building service is seeing strong adoption.\nEmergent co-founders Mukund Jha and Madhav JhaImage Credits:Emergent\nEmergent says it is headquartered in San Francisco, but 70 of its 75 employees work out of an office in Bengaluru.

Accel also backed Rocket, another India-founded startup, in a $15 million seed round last year, along with Together Fund and Salesforce Ventures.\nThe deal is also notable as it marks SoftBank’s return to investing in India — the firm previously backed Indian commerce startup ElasticRun nearly four years ago. \nEmergent says the fresh funding will be used to expand its team, accelerate product development, and deepen its presence in key markets.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "description": "Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that startup Witness AI is trying to solve. It detects employee use of unapproved tools, blocking attacks, and ensuring compliance. ",
    "body": "\n\n\n\nWhat happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you? \nThat’s not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors. \n“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”\nMeftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. \nMisaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. \nWitness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.\n“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.\n“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said. \nAs to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.\nPlenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.\nCaccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.\n“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat them?”\nFor his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider. \n“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nDubai-based restaurant reservation startup Eat App aims to make India a focal point of its business with new fundraising, an acquisition, and partnering with Swiggy to sell a solution to restaurants to aggregate reservation data and grow their business based on that.\nThe company said that it has raised $10 million in a Series B extension round led by PSG Equity through its portfolio company Zenchef SAS. Notably, this amount is larger than the startup’s original Series B round of $6 million in 2022. With this fundraiser, Eat App has now raised over $23 million in funding to date. \nThe company, which has been around for more than a decade, has been present in over 92 countries, serving more than 5,000 restaurants and $12 million in ARR. However, in the last 12 months, India has been a central focus for the company as it scaled to over 2,000 restaurants in the country.\nIndia’s food service industry is set to reach over $85 billion by 2028, according to industry reports, with dine-in making more than half of it. Restaurants are relying on walk-ins and separately managing their reservations coming from sources like Zomato, Swiggy, and EazyDiner. \nImage Credits: Eat App\nTo achieve scale, Eat App acquired a rival called ReserveGo and also partnered with a recently listed food and grocery platform, Swiggy, to upsell its restaurant product.\nReserveGo was built by Vijayan Parthasarathy in 2022. Parthasarathy has had a storied history in restarant reservation industry. Prior to ReserveGo, he built a similar platform called Inrestro in 2014, which was acquired by Times Internet-owned Dineout in 2015. In 2022, Swiggy acquired Dineout from Times Internet.\nEat App acquired ReverseGo in mid-2025, which was serving over 1,000 restaurants at that time. Parthasarathy told TechCrunch that the platform has averaged handling 5 million reservations per month for the last 12 months without having any downtimes. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEatApp also partnered with Swiggy to market its product to restaurants for upselling, which has taken the total restaurant tally for the startup over 2,000, with over 8 million covers served until the year’s end through various platforms. For comparison, Swiggy’s Dineout platform alone catered to over 23.8 million covers in 2025.\n“There has never been a more exciting time for the restaurant industry in the country, with steady consumer uptake and innovations. We believe access to Eat App’s world-class technology and AI-driven tools is going to improve restaurant management, helping restaurants across the country bring a more delightful experience to their guests, “Arpit Mathur, Vice President of Strategy at Swiggy, said in a statement.\nThe company, which was listed on the Indian markets last year, said that it partnered with Eat App to bring a global solution for restaurants to grow their business.\nSwiggy and EatApp market this solution as GroMax for India, which includes add-ons such as the ability to promote restaurants on Meta and Swiggy, apart from reservation management. While Swiggy doesn’t play a part in product development, its sales team provides input to Eat App about potential features it can develop for the market. \nImage Credits: Eat App\nBefore its India expansion, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was its biggest market, followed by the U.S., the U.K, and Saudi Arabia.\n“Honestly, like we see India, there’s very strong synergy and similarities between what we’ve seen in the [GCC] region eight, nine years ago, especially in Dubai, where we first, I would say, we were responsible for building that scaffolding, that tech infrastructure layer [for serving restaurants]. And we see a lot of similarities in India. [to that],” Nezar Kadhem, CEO of Eat App, told TechCrunch.\n“We hope that whatever efforts were made in the region in Dubai and where restaurants have the tooling today, we could serve the same in India alongside local founders like Vijayan and the team to help us spearhead the change in India,” he added.\nIndia is a market with a big opportunity in the restaurant space. However, for restaurants, the challenge is to attract customers using every channel possible and then collate those reservations in one place. Parthasarathy noted that the top 200 restaurants in India are only available for customers through reservations. But for the next few thousands it is a lot about capacity management through different channels.\nEat App’s growth faces a few obstacles. First, there are international competitors such as Seven Rooms, TableCheck, and OpenTable, along with local ones like PetPooja and Posist. Second, some restaurants just bank on walk-ins or do not use an aggregation software to get data about their diners. \nSeveral industry executives TechCrunch spoke with said that reservation aggregation software as a standalone product wouldn’t entice restaurant owners. Eat App will need to prove their growth suite brings enough value to restaurants. \n"

Under the deal, which was worth just under $70 million, Apple’s in-house studio will be producing the show’s future seasons. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer. \nThe deal is similar to one Apple struck with AMC Studios for sci-fi show “Silo” after season one. \n“Severance” will now be one of Apple’s marquee titles, joining popular series such as “Your Friends and Neighbors” and “Stick.”\nAccording to Deadline, the production costs for “Severance” had exceeded what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already requested advances from Apple and was considering relocating production from New York to Canada for bigger and quicker tax rebates. Since Apple definitely has the funds to back the show, the company decided to take full control.\n“Severance” is important to the streamer, as the show’s second season became Apple’s most-watched series at the time. It also had the highest number of nominations at the 2025 Emmy Awards.\nDeadline reports that the show is expected to run for four seasons, with the possibility of spin-offs, a prequel, and foreign versions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

    "body": "\nApple has been promising a new-and-improved, cutting-edge, AI-powered Siri since it first unveiled Apple Intelligence in 2024. Over about a year and a half since then, the release date for this new era of Siri has been continuously pushed back. According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we’ll likely have to wait even longer.\nWhile the new Siri was expected to launch with the upcoming iOS 26.4 update in March, now, the changes are expected to roll out more slowly over time, reportedly postponing some features until the May iOS update, or even until the release of iOS 27 in September. Apparently, Apple ran into trouble when testing the software, requiring the launch date to be pushed back further.\nThe changes are rumored to make the longtime digital assistant more like the LLM chatbots that have swept the tech world — but instead of opening up a ChatGPT or Claude app on your iPhone or MacBook, you would be able to just talk to Siri, which will be powered by Google Gemini.\nWe’re starting to feel bad for the Siri product managers.

Discovery (WBD) is facing significant new resistance. Investment group Ancora Holdings announced it has purchased $200 million in WBD shares and opposes Netflix’s offer. Instead, Ancora is throwing its support behind a rival bid from Paramount.\nThe WSJ had the exclusive. \n​In a press release on Wednesday, Ancora aligned itself with Paramount’s arguments: It claims the Netflix deal is inferior, involves more regulatory risk, and doesn’t deliver as much immediate cash to shareholders. \n​Just one day earlier, Paramount improved its bid by offering WBD shareholders a new incentive: $0.25 per share for each quarter the deal remains unclosed after December 31, 2026. Additionally, it pledged to cover the $2.8 billion termination fee owed to Netflix if WBD shareholders choose Paramount’s offer.\nAncora stepping in is notable because, while its stake may be relatively small, it’s seeking to rally other shareholders to reject the Netflix proposal. Ancora has warned that if the WBD board refuses to reconsider Paramount’s proposal, it will vote against the Netflix deal and press for board accountability at the company’s 2026 annual meeting. \n​Still, it remains uncertain whether Ancora will be able to sway a significant number of other shareholders. Just last month, WBD reported that more than 93% of shareholders had voted against what the company called Paramount’s less attractive offer, instead favoring the Netflix deal.\n​But if Ancora actually gets a few shareholders to change their minds, the whole Netflix takeover could get flipped on its head. Suddenly, this already tense situation would get even more unpredictable and dramatic.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

The beta version is now available in the app.​\nTo use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store’s page to begin shopping. \nCustomers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the basket by swapping items for preferred brands or adding more products from the store.​\nImage Credits:Uber Eats\nUber Eats notes that Cart Assistant uses previous orders to prioritize familiar items — like your usual milk or favorite oatmeal — to make the experience more personalized.​\n“Users were telling us they wanted a quicker way to shop, and we know how precious your time is,” Uber CTO Praveen Neppalli Naga said in a statement. “Cart Assistant helps you get from idea to checkout in seconds.” \nCart Assistant could help Uber Eats better compete with other food delivery and grocery apps that are already integrating or developing AI chatbots.​ For example, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2023 to help customers save time and receive personalized shopping recommendations. DoorDash was also reportedly testing an AI chatbot called DashAI that same year.​\nLast year, both Uber Eats and rival DoorDash integrated with ChatGPT to streamline food ordering. With Uber Eats, U.S. users can browse local restaurants and menus in ChatGPT, then complete their purchase in the Uber Eats app. DoorDash’s integration allows users to request meal plans and automatically add all necessary ingredients to their DoorDash cart.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNotably, Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Uber Eats was developing an AI-powered chatbot that would supposedly ask users about their budget and food preferences, and help them place an order.​\nOverall, Uber Eats is rapidly investing in AI, including tools for merchants like AI-generated menu descriptions, enhanced food photos, and customer review summaries.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nOpenAI has disbanded a team that was designed to communicate the company’s mission to the public and to its own employees. At the same time, the team’s former leader has been given a new role as the company’s “chief futurist.”\nOpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team’s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer.\nThe disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting “the company’s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”\nAn official OpenAI spokesperson described the team thusly: “The Mission Alignment project was a support function to help employees and the public understand our mission and the impact of AI. That work continues throughout the organization.”\nIn a blog post published Wednesday, Josh Achiam, the former head of OpenAI’s mission alignment team, explained his new role as the company’s chief futurist. “My goal is to support OpenAI’s mission — to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity — by studying how the world will change in response to AI, AGI, and beyond,” Achiam wrote.\nAchiam noted that, in his new role, he would be collaborating with Jason Pruet, an OpenAI physicist.\nA spokesperson for OpenAI said the rest of the mission alignment team — a group of six or seven people — had subsequently been reassigned to different parts of the company. The spokesperson couldn’t say where exactly the team members had been assigned, but said that they were engaged in similar work in those roles. It was also unclear whether Achiam would have a new team as part of his “futurist” role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe spokesperson attributed the disbanding of the team to the kinds of routine reorganizations that occur within a fast-moving company. \nOpenAI previously had what it called a “superalignment team” — which was formed in 2023 and focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI — but that team was disbanded in 2024. \nAchiam’s personal website still lists him as head of mission alignment at OpenAI, and describes him as being interested in ensuring that the “long-term future of humanity is good.” His LinkedIn profile shows he had served as head of mission alignment since September 2024.\nCorrection: This story originally confused mission alignment with another, similarly named team called alignment. It has been corrected and we apologize for the error.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Joan Cros/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 AM PST · February 11, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nGoogle on Wednesday released the first beta of Android 17, which brings performance improvements and a way to add new features to media and camera apps. Most importantly, it’s changing how developers get access to new APIs and features of the latest version.\nWith this release, the company is ditching developer betas and adopting a continuous Canary channel to push updates for developers. This is similar to how Google approaches web browser development, as Google has a Canary channel for the Chrome browser, too.\nThe company said that because of this approach, features and APIs become available to developers as soon as they are approved in internal testing. Plus, the Canary channel allows for over-the-air updates, benefiting developers with more integrated workflows and better ways to test their apps.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle said it’s targeting March for platform stability, with the planned release of Android 17 in Q2 2026. With Android 16’s release last year, Google adopted a two-release structure in a calendar year, with a major SDK release in the first half and a minor SDK release in the second half of the year. The company made this move to give time to device makers to roll out the latest version more quickly to devices and reduce fragmentation in the Android ecosystem.\nAndroid 17 will restrict developers from opting out of resizing restrictions. This means developers can’t force orientation or resizing on large-screen devices. This is Google’s way of making more apps work better on tablets and foldables in different orientations and window sizes.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding more camera capabilities to Android 17. It’s adding APIs to let developers handle camera transitions more smoothly, support for VVC (H.266) video codec, better handling of loudness across apps to maintain consistent volume, and stricter controls for background audio.\nAndroid 17 also brings performance improvements, decreased missed frames, and a better garbage collection mechanism for memory clean-up. The company is improving Wi-Fi connectivity with better proximity detection and secure peer discovery, as well. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11:50 AM PST · February 11, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt’s already quite easy to use Cash App. However, on Wednesday, the payment platform owned by Block, Inc. introduced a new feature designed to make its user experience significantly easier: payment links.\nThe feature allows app users to send payments via a hyperlink that can be attached to a variety of communications.\nUsers can access the links by taking the typical steps in Cash App’s payment tab, but instead of clicking “add recipient,” the user now has the option to click “share link.” Choosing this will create a link that can subsequently be added to texts, emails, and DMs as a payment request. The recipient clicks the link, which preloads the requested payment amount, allowing the transaction to be facilitated quickly.\nCash App says that the links can be used for recurring payments as well as group payments.\nCash App introduced the new feature after surveying Gen Z users and finding that it was common for multiple communications to occur around payments. The links are designed to alleviate any social awkwardness that may accompany those communications while also making payments more direct.\nImage Credits:Cash App\n“Payment links make moving money even more seamless, but just as importantly, they make the task of requesting money feel more human and less awkward,” said Kristen Anderson, P2P & Networks Product Lead at Cash App. “We’ve heard from our customers that sending in-app payment requests and push notifications can sometimes come across as overly formal or even passive-aggressive. Payment links solve this by allowing customers to send requests through whichever platform feels most natural so that they can add context, levity, or humor to the conversation.” \nCash App has added a number of new features lately, including an AI chatbot that debuted late last year and is designed to advise users on their finances, as well as a new benefits program with a high-borrowing limit.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round.\nGeneral Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.  \nModal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.\nModal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.\nModal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a $300 million raise at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.\nIn January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an $800 million valuation. Meanwhile, TechCrunch reported that the team behind SGLang has commercialized as RadixArk, which sources told us secured seed funding at a $400 million valuation led by Accel.\nModal was co-founded by CEO Erik Bernhardsson in 2021 after he spent more than 15 years building and leading data teams at companies including Spotify and Better.com, where he was CTO.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe startup counts Lux Capital and Redpoint Ventures among its earlier backers.\nEditor’s Note: This story was updated to include a comment from Modal.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft has rolled out fixes for security vulnerabilities in Windows and Office, which the company says are being actively abused by hackers to break into people’s computers.\nThe exploits are one-click attacks, meaning that a hacker can plant malware or gain access to a victim’s computer with minimal user interaction. At least two flaws can be exploited by tricking someone into clicking a malicious link on their Windows computer. Another can result in a compromise on opening a malicious Office file.\nThe vulnerabilities are known as zero-days, because the hackers were exploiting the bugs before Microsoft had time to fix them.\nDetails of how to exploit the bugs have been published, Microsoft said, potentially increasing the chance of hacks. Microsoft did not say where they had been published, and a Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch. In its bug reports, Microsoft acknowledged the input of security researchers in Google’s Threat Intelligence Group in their discovery of the vulnerabilities. \nMicrosoft said one of the bugs, officially tracked as CVE-2026-21510, was found in the Windows shell, which powers the operating system’s user interface. The bug affects all supported versions of Windows, the company said. When a victim clicks on a malicious link from their computer, the bug allows hackers to bypass Microsoft’s SmartScreen feature that would typically screen malicious links and files for malware.\nAccording to security expert Dustin Childs, this bug can be abused to remotely plant malware on the victim’s computer.\n“There is user interaction here, as the client needs to click a link or a shortcut file,” Childs wrote in his blog post. “Still, a one-click bug to gain code execution is a rarity.”\nA Google spokesperson confirmed that the Windows shell bug was under “widespread, active exploitation,” and said successful hacks allowed the silent execution of malware with high privileges, “posing a high risk of subsequent system compromise, deployment of ransomware, or intelligence collection.”\nAnother Windows bug, tracked as CVE-2026-21513, was found in Microsoft’s proprietary browser engine, MSHTML, which powers its legacy and long-discontinued Internet Explorer browser. It’s still found in newer versions of Windows to ensure backward compatibility with older apps. \nMicrosoft said this bug allows hackers to bypass security features in Windows to plant malware.\nAccording to independent security reporter Brian Krebs, Microsoft also patched three other zero-day bugs in its software that were being actively exploited by hackers.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThreads is introducing an AI-powered feature that lets users personalize their feed, the Meta-owned social network announced on Wednesday. The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed.\nTo use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear Algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after submitting a request.\nIt’s worth noting that because Dear Algo works through public postings, others are able to see your request, and they can even repost your request to apply it to their own feed. This aspect of the feature may be a hindrance for some users, as they might not want their requests to be public. However, Meta says it views this as a way for users to discover new conversations and topics, turning personalization into a community experience.\nImage Credits:Meta\nBy allowing users to temporarily influence what appears on their feeds, Threads gains an edge over its competitors by offering a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms.\n“Threads is where you go to keep up with what’s happening right now,” the company wrote in a blog post. “But sometimes, what matters to you changes in an instant, and you want your Threads feed to reflect that — whether it’s seeing more posts during a live NBA game or less about a TV show you haven’t caught up on yet.”\nAlthough Threads and its competitors, X and Bluesky, already offer users a simple way to indicate their preferences with a “Not Interested” button, the new Dear Algo feature takes personalization a step further. The feature could also help make Threads feel more real-time, something X has historically been known for.\nDear Algo is available now in the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K. Threads plans to introduce it in more countries in the future. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe launch of the new feature comes a few weeks after a report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggested that Threads now surpasses X in daily mobile usage. Although X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.\nThe report revealed that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on mobile as of January 7, 2026, while X had 125 million daily active users.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised concerns over allegations that Apple is censoring conservative content on the Apple News app. \nIn a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, FTC chair Andrew Ferguson cited reports from Media Research Center, a right-leaning think tank, which accused Apple of excluding right-leaning outlets from the top 20 articles in the Apple News feed.\n“These reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers […] I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons,” Ferguson’s letter reads.\nFerguson, a Big Tech critic who Trump appointed to lead the competition regulator, noted the FTC doesn’t have any powers to require Apple to take ideological or political positions when curating news, but he said that if the company’s practices are “inconsistent” its terms of service or “reasonable expectations of consumers,” they may be in violation of the FTC Act.\nBrendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (another Trump appointee critical of Big Tech), supported Ferguson’s stance, writing, “Apple has no right to suppress conservative viewpoints in violation of the FTC Act.”\nFerguson has urged Apple to conduct a “comprehensive review” of its terms of service and ensure that the content curated on Apple News is consistent with its policies, and “take corrective action swiftly” if the curation isn’t in line.\nThe letter comes a day after President Donald Trump shared the report by Media Research Center on his social media platform, Truth Social. Trump has repeatedly accused Big Tech companies of censoring right-leaning content, though many major platforms have rolled back several measures to curb fake news and disinformation they had imposed in the years prior to his second stint at the White House.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple’s relationship with the Trump administration has oscillated between warm and cold over the past year. Trump has criticized Big Tech, especially Apple, for manufacturing its devices in China, but after Cook promised to spend more than $600 billion over the next four years stateside and moved to mend fences, relations between the administration and the company have improved. Apple also dodged planned tariffs on smartphones made overseas and imported into the U.S.\nThe FTC last year also launched an investigation into “censorship by tech platforms,” seeking input from the public who felt they were silenced due to their political ideologies or affiliations. “Tech firms should not be bullying their users,” Ferguson said at the time. “This inquiry will help the FTC better understand how these firms may have violated the law by silencing and intimidating Americans for speaking their minds.”\n Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.\nThe full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.\n\nThe most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.\n“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk said on X. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”\nThe new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.\n“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”\nImage Credits:xAI (screenshot)\nThe all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said X had “just crossed” $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, executives said the xAI’s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.\nBut it’s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.\nThe most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver — essentially an electromagnetic catapult — to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun’s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.\n“It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” Musk said, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The company on Wednesday said it now has 325 million paying users across Google One and YouTube Premium, up from 300 million three months earlier.\nYouTube reported ad revenue increased 9% to $11.38 billion in the fourth quarter, but missed analysts’ average estimates of $11.84 billion. YouTube’s overall revenue, including ads and subscriptions, came in at $60 billion in the full financial year, up 17% compared to a year earlier.\nThe company said that YouTube’s $8 per month, ad-free premium tier is seeing strong traction, but didn’t specify any numbers. It added that YouTube Premium also saw strong growth.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company plans to flesh out its subscription offerings, especially to capitalize on its growing YouTube TV userbase. “We’ll soon launch new YouTube TV plans, bringing more choice and flexibility to subscribers with over 10 genre-specific packages,” he said. \nYouTube Shorts recorded 200 billion average daily views in the quarter, the same as last year, but in some countries, ads on short-form video earn more than in-stream ads on a per-hour basis, the company said. Pichai also highlighted podcasts as a growing format, with viewers watching 700 million hours of podcasts from their TVs in October.\nYouTube said that its AI features are seeing traction, and more than 1 million channels are using its AI creation tools. The company said that 20 million consumers used its Gemini-powered content discovery tool in December.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex: GPT-5.3 Codex. \nThe company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.” \nOpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25 percent faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing.\nThe new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a new agentic coding model released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models.   \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Anthropic\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:51 AM PST · February 5, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nOn Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only released last November, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.\nPerhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.\n“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.\nOpus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) currently offers. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.\nThe new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.\nWhite told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has launched a new product to help enterprises navigate the world of AI agents, focusing on agent management as critical infrastructure for enterprise AI adoption.\nOn Thursday, AI giant OpenAI announced the launch of OpenAI Frontier, an end-to-end platform designed for enterprises to build and manage AI agents. It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.\nFrontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.\nOpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.\nOpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.\nThe company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according to reporting from The Verge. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.\nAgent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, Agentforce, which the company launched in the fall of 2024. Others have quickly followed. LangChain is a notable player in the space that was founded in 2022 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital. CrewAI is a smaller upstart that has raised more than $20 million in venture capital.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn December, global research and advisory firm Gartner released a report about this type of software and called agent management platforms both the “most valuable real estate in AI” and a necessary piece of infrastructure for enterprises to adopt AI.\nIt’s not surprising that OpenAI would release this platform in early 2026, as the company has made it clear that enterprise adoption is one of its main focus areas for this year. The company has also announced two notable enterprise deals this year with ServiceNow and Snowflake.\nStill, if OpenAI wants to be a meaningful player in the enterprise space, offering a product like Frontier is a promising step.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nThe computer systems of La Sapienza in Rome, one of the largest universities in Europe with around 120,000 students, have been down for three days following an apparent ransomware attack. \nIn a post and stories on Instagram published Tuesday, the university said that it took down its systems out of precaution following the cyberattack, that it was investigating the incident and working on restoring all digital services, and that some communication channels such as email and workstations are “partially limited.” \nThe school also said that it was working to restore systems based on backups, which were not affected by the hack. \nAs of this writing the Sapienza website remains down. \nItalian daily news outlet Il Corriere della Sera reported this week that the disruption is due to a ransomware attack, something that the school nor other authorities have confirmed so far. The hackers allegedly sent the university a link to a request for a ransom, which has a countdown of 72 hours, which would start only once the link is clicked. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this attack, or the Femwar02 ransomware gang?

It’s unclear if the university is able to accept email at the time we reached out.\nSpokespeople for Italy’s national cybersecurity agency, Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale (or ACN), which is investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asking for more information and if the attack was caused by ransomware.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn another article on Wednesday, Il Corriere reported that the hacking group behind the attack is called “Femwar02,” which was previously unknown prior to this incident. The gang used the BabLock malware, which was discovered in 2023 and is also known as Rorschach, according to the report.\nLa Sapienza said that exams are proceeding as normal, but students who want to sign up for exams must do so directly with professors. The school also set up “infopoints” on several locations on campus to provide information to students. \nLike other types of organizations, universities and schools are frequent targets of hackers. Last year, the notorious hacking group ShinyHunters hacked Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania and stole data — without using malware to encrypt its systems — in an effort to extort the schools. The hackers revealed this week that the schools did not pay the ransom.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nOn Friday, when SpaceX filed plans with the FCC for a million-satellite data center network, you might have thought Elon Musk was having a bit of fun with us. But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious. \nThe most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI that went forward on Monday, officially drawing together Musk’s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there’s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned. \nBut even beyond the merger, we’re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters — essentially, networks of computers operating in space — cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It’s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step of sharing the filing on X. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himself eager to help Trump’s friends and punish his enemies — so as long as Musk stays on Trump’s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.\nAt the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On a new episode of Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint,” which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.\n“It’s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk said in the podcast. “Any given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it’s actually much cheaper to do in space.”\nClose listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It’s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn’t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren’t the only way to power a data center, it doesn’t follow that it’s cheaper to do the whole thing in orbit, as Patel noted in the podcast. Patel also raised concerns about servicing GPUs that fail during AI model training, but you’ll have to listen to the full episode for that.\n\nOverall, Musk was undeterred, marking 2028 as a tipping point year for orbital data centers. “You can mark my words, in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,” Musk said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe didn’t stop there. “Five years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the cumulative total on Earth,” Musk continued.\nFor context, as of 2030, global data center capacity will be an estimated 200 GW, which is roughly a trillion dollars’ worth of infrastructure when you’re just putting it on the ground.\nOf course, SpaceX makes its money by launching things into orbit, so all this is pretty convenient for Musk — particularly now that SpaceX has an AI company attached to it. And with the new SpaceX-xAI conglomerate headed for an IPO in just a few months, you can expect to hear a lot more about orbital data centers in the months ahead. With tech companies still pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data center spending each year, there’s a real chance that not all the money will remain earthbound.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

NASA astronauts will be allowed to bring their smartphones to space for the first time, starting with the Crew-12 and Artemis II missions.\nCrew-12 is expected to head to the International Space Station next week, while the highly anticipated Artemis II mission — which will bring humans around the moon for the first time since the 1960s — was delayed until March.\n“We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,” NASA administrator Jared Isaacman wrote on X.\nWith the newest iPhones and Android devices at hand, the crew will be able to be a bit more spontaneous with image and video gathering, meaning that for those of us back home, these upcoming trips to space could end up being some of NASA’s most well-documented journeys yet.\nImagine how cool (or cringe-worthy) it will be if astronauts turn themselves into TikTok stars in zero gravity, or if they take ultra-wide-angle selfies in the spacecraft. For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.\n“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”\nIt makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to Ars Technica. That’s by no means arcane, but there’s something more spontaneous and whimsical about using a smartphone.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis is not, however, the first time that smartphones have gone to space.

The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.” \nSubstack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected.\nIn an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. Best said that the company has fixed the problem and started an investigation.\n“I’m reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. “I’m incredibly sorry this happened. We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”\nIt’s not clear what exactly the issue was with its systems, and the scope of the data that was accessed. It’s also not yet known why the company took five months to detect the breach, or if the company was contacted by hackers demanding a ransom. TechCrunch asked the company for more details, and we will update our story if we hear back.\nSubstack did not say how many users are affected. The company said that it doesn’t have any evidence that users’ data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction.\nOn its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone it reached last March.

    "body": "\nElevenLabs co-founder and CEO Mati Staniszewski says voice is becoming the next major interface for AI – the way people will increasingly interact with machines as models move beyond text and screens.\nSpeaking at Web Summit in Doha, Staniszewski told TechCrunch voice models like those developed by ElevenLabs have recently moved beyond simply mimicking human speech — including emotion and intonation – to working in tandem with the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology. \nIn the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”\nThat vision fueled ElevenLabs’s $500 million raise this week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry. OpenAI and Google have both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies through acquisitions like Q.ai. As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development. \nIconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”\nAnd as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users. \nStaniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making interactions feel more natural and requiring less effort from users. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat evolution, he added, will influence how voice models are deployed. While high-quality audio models have largely lived in the cloud, Staniszewski said ElevenLabs is working toward a hybrid approach that blends cloud and on-device processing — a move aimed at supporting new hardware, including headphones and other wearables, where voice becomes a constant companion rather than a feature you decide when to engage with. \nElevenLabs is already partnering with Meta to bring its voice technology to products including Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company’s virtual reality platform. Staniszewski said he would also be open to working with Meta on its Ray-Ban smart glasses as voice-driven interfaces expand into new form factors. \nBut as voice becomes more persistent and embedded in everyday hardware, it opens the door to serious concerns around privacy, surveillance, and how much personal data voice-based systems will store as they move closer to users’ daily lives — something companies like Google have already been accused of abusing.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nMeta is testing a stand-alone Vibes app, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. Launched last September, Vibes lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others.\nThink TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every video you come across is AI generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app that launched shortly after Vibes.\n“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”\nThe news was first reported by Platformer. \nMeta says it doesn’t share specific numbers but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a stand-alone app.\nThe tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a stand-alone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.\nVibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.\nMeta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.\nIt’s worth noting that Meta told TechCrunch last week that, in addition to testing new premium subscriptions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’s going to explore subscriptions for AI features, including Vibes.\nAlthough Vibes has been free since its launch, Meta plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. Meta plans to launch these test subscriptions in the coming months. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA data breach at government technology giant Conduent appears to affect far more people than first disclosed, with the number of victims potentially stretching to dozens of millions of people across the United States.\nThe January 2025 ransomware attack, which knocked out Conduent’s operations for several days, is now known to affect at least 15.4 million people in Texas alone, accounting for about half of the state’s population. Conduent said in October that 4 million people across the state were affected.\nAnother 10.5 million people are affected across Oregon, per the state’s attorney general. \nConduent has also notified hundreds of thousands of people across Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states, according to data breach notifications seen by TechCrunch.\nThe stolen data includes individuals’ names, Social Security numbers, medical data and health insurance information.\nOne of the largest government contractors today, Conduent handles and processes large amounts of personal and sensitive information on behalf of large corporations, government departments, and several U.S. states. The company says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people in the United States across various government healthcare programs.\nWhen contacted with several questions about the data breach, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins provided a boilerplate statement that did not address the questions, nor did they answer if Conduent knows how many individuals are affected by the cyberattack. The spokesperson would not say if the breach affects more than 100 million people.\nCollins said that the company has been working to “conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information” taken in the breach, but would not say how many data breach notifications the company has sent out to date.\nLittle else is known about the breach, and the company has disclosed few details. Conduent disclosed the cyberattack in April, months after hackers knocked out the company’s systems, which resulted in outages to government services across the United States.\nThe Safeway ransomware gang took credit for the breach, claiming to have stolen over 8 terabytes of data.\nIn a later SEC filing, the company said that the stolen data sets “contained a significant number of individuals’ personal information associated with our clients’ end-users,” referring to its corporate and government customers.\nConduent also said it is continuing to notify individuals whose data was stolen in the breach, and plans to conclude alerting individuals by early 2026.

    "body": "\nWhile Spotify users face yet another price hike, book lovers have some exciting developments to look forward to that could help cushion the blow.\nSpotify announced several updates for its audiobook business on Thursday, notably its expansion into physical books. Users in the U.S. and the UK will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app, marking a significant pivot for the once digital-only platform. \nThe company also introduced two features designed to make the audiobook experience smoother and more flexible, including a new tool called “Page Match” that lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook. \nAdditionally, “Audiobook Recaps”—a previously iOS-only feature—is coming to Android devices in the spring. This feature provides bite-sized recaps tailored to the last section users stopped listening to.\nImage Credits:Spotify\n​Spotify’s decision to sell physical books through its app positions it as a competitor to major booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. \nSpotify has partnered with Bookshop.org on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. Spotify then earns an affiliate fee on sales. \nThe ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop’s website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Spotify\nTo bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by Android Authority last month. \nSpotify’s new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It’s powered by a combination of Spotify’s in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.\nWhen users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they’re reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.\nPage Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.\nIn the two years since Spotify first introduced audiobooks, the platform has experienced significant growth. The company reported in October that the number of users listening to audiobooks rose 36% over the past year, and listening hours increased 37%. Plus, more than half of Spotify’s 281 million premium subscribers have engaged with an audiobook.\nSpotify is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results February 10.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSnap is on a mission to diversify its revenue sources — moving from a business model in which it largely chases ad revenue to one where it can also make money through subscriptions and, eventually, hardware. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.\nIn Q4, Snap’s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.\nThe company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform launched back in 2022. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.\nWhile those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.\nReuters also reports that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.\nDuring Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to charge users for Memories storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.\n“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nFusion power’s biggest question remains unanswered: how do you ensure the cost to start the fusion reaction isn’t higher than the price at which you can sell the power?\nPlenty of people have ideas, but no one has cracked it yet. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned on until next year, leaving the question unanswered for now.\nOther companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, including Pacific Fusion, which today announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratory that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.\nFusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.\nPacific Fusion is chasing an approach known as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to the experiments carried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy. \nBut where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.\n“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kickstart to work properly. To create conditions in the fuel pellet hot enough for fusion, researchers have been using both lasers and magnets to warm it up beforehand. “It’s just a little bit of energy just to give it a little bit of a boost before you compress it,” LeChien said, on the order of 5% to 10% of the total energy. \nBut the added lasers and magnets add upfront complexity, cost, and maintenance requirements to the machine, making it that much harder to sell power at competitive prices.\nSo in the experiments at Sandia, Pacific Fusion tweaked the design of the cylinder encasing the fuel pellet and adjusted the electrical current delivered to it. Before the big pulse of electricity that ignites the fusion reaction, the company allowed a bit of the magnetic field to leak through to the fuel before compressing it, warming it in the process. \n“We can make very subtle changes to how this cylinder is manufactured that allow the magnetic field to leak or to seep into the fuel before it’s compressed,” LeChien said.\nPacific Fusion’s fuel is loaded in a plastic target that’s wrapped in aluminum. By varying the thickness of the aluminum, the company can adjust how much of the magnetic field makes its way to the fuel. The casing needs to be manufactured with some precision, but nothing crazy, LeChien said — something on the order of what’s required for a .22 caliber bullet casing. “That’s a process that’s been honed and manufactured and perfected over 100 plus years,” he added.\nThe tweaks don’t significantly change how much energy Pacific Fusion needs to deliver to the target. “It doesn’t take much energy to actually allow that magnetic field into the center of the fuel,” he said. “It’s a tiny fraction, much less than 1%. It’s a very, very, very small fraction of the overall energy in the system, so it’s effectively unnoticeable.”\nEliminating the magnetic system would simplify the system and its maintenance requirements, which would have a modest effect on overall cost, he said. But getting rid of the laser would cut costs significantly. “The scale of laser [needed] to preheat these types of systems at high gain is north of $100 million.”\nLeChien said experiments like this also help refine the company’s simulations to ensure they’re in agreement with what happens in the real world. “A lot of people have simulated things and said, ‘Oh, this will work or that will work,’” he said. “It’s a very different game to simulate something, build it, test it, and have it work. Closing that loop is hard.” \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAn AI lab called Fundamental emerged from stealth on Thursday, offering a new foundation model to solve an old problem: how to draw insights from the huge quantities of structured data produced by enterprises. By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.\n“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”\nThe idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.\nCalled a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on the transformer architecture that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.\nThose differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.\nAs Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.\n“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”\nThat promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

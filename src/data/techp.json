Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was first reported by CNBC.\nThe letter was an appeal for investment into Tiger Global’s next venture capital fund and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo. In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring.\nThat number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too. Waymo, which provides commercial robotaxi service in five cities, has announced plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including Dallas, Denver, Houston, Nashville, and San Diego.\nA Waymo spokesperson declined to comment. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

    "body": "\nPhoto editing app VSCO has confirmed that it has laid off 24 employees amid a restructuring drive to refocus the company’s efforts towards creating tools for professional photographers.\nIn an internal memo seen by TechCrunch, VSCO’s CEO Eric Wittman said the company’s consumer business had declined more than expected, and some of its new growth initiatives didn’t yield the expected results. He noted that the company had been EBITDA-positive for three of the past four years. And despite a decline in consumer business, other lines saw growth, even if it was not to the company’s liking. In the memo, he also claimed that VSCO’s core app is installed on more U.S. devices than Reddit.\nThe company told TechCrunch that the layoffs impacted its marketing, tech, and program management teams.\n“Last week, VSCO said goodbye to 24 employees as a result of a company restructure [sic],” Wittman said in an emailed statement. “Valued members across all departments were impacted. Every person leaving has contributed meaningfully to VSCO and our mission, and we are deeply grateful for their impact. The company is restructuring and adjusting internal operations to be more efficient and effective in delivering long-term success and value for photographers.” \n“To succeed over the next 5 years, we need to operate as an AI-native company, taking bold but focused bets and strengthening the foundation we’ve built through our Pro business, AI Lab, TFP, and Sites,” Wittman wrote in the memo.\nVSCO said that to power growth, it wants to increase brand awareness as well as work on AI-powered features across the line. The company plans to work on a revamped “AI native” editor, and build an AI assistant that could help users complete tasks across its tools. The startup also plans to redesign its public Photo Galleries feature, which lets photographers curate their portfolio and showcase their work.\nLast year, VSCO launched a marketplace to connect photographers and brands for projects. This year, VSCO focused on shipping AI-powered products such as Canvas for collaboration and new editing features.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs consumer apps like Canva, Google Photos and Adobe Lightroom focus on adding AI features to their products, it appears VSCO may have realized that instead of AI chops, carving a niche for itself by providing better tools and a dedicated platform for pro photographers would be a good strategy.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAnthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. \nPreviously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests.\nThe move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work.\nCursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots.\nFor Slack, positioning itself as an “agentic hub” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work.\nBy letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows.\nWhile Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude’s API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. \nThe discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with.\nThe move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content.\nWhile some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms.\nIt’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. \nThe new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlthough a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Meta also has a short-form video feed of AI-generated videos called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nShanea Leven says she learned two important lessons when building her first company, CodeSee. The first lesson was knowing the difference between what businesses need versus what sounds visionary; the second was that the fundamentals always apply, even with new technologies such as AI.\n“Security, compliance, reliability, quality, those things don’t just go away for enterprise applications,” she said.\nAfter CodeSee was acquired in 2024, Leven decided that she wanted to build a product that would let business owners, even those without technical backgrounds, build AI applications. She teamed up with AI researcher Sean Robinson, and last October, the two launched Empromptu, an AI service that businesses can use to build AI applications.\nEmpromptu claims all a user has to do is tell the platform’s AI chatbot what they want — like a new classification app or a generative recommendation app — and the tool will go ahead and build it. It also provides LLM tools to help users if they want to fine-tune any results, and also lets companies add AI features to their own existing code bases.\nLeven doesn’t consider it a vibe-coding platform, though she does look to compete with companies like Replit and Lovable.\n“Vibe coding is excellent for quick experiments, but Empromptu is what turns those experiments into real software,” she said. Empromptu, she continued, “turns ideas into production features with built-in evaluation, governance, and self-improvement,” she said. “You ship to real customers, with real data and complete control. If vibe coding is the brainstorm, Empromptu is the build.” \nOn Tuesday, the company said it had raised $2 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Precursor Ventures. Zeal Capital, Alumni Ventures, Founders Edge and South Loop also participated. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLeven said the fresh capital will be used for hiring staff and developing new proprietary technology. It also announced three new features, including the ability to create custom data models and infinite memory. \nThe company is hoping to target businesses launching in regulated industries or “deeply complex” areas that involve capturing data and creating applications — software that services hotels, for example.\nOverall, Leven hopes that founders feel their businesses can be transformed without having to learn the technical skills to take advantage of the AI revolution.\n“It’s just like any other skill,” Leven said. “And the beauty of this skill is that AI can help you learn it along the way.”  \nThis piece was updated to clarify what Empromptu does. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

The company also teased the upcoming launch of “Shared Feeds,” which will let users watch TikTok content together through a shared interest-based feed.\nTikTok rolled out individual Collections earlier this year to let users save content in custom folders. With Shared Collections, users can now do things like create a space to share cookie-swap plans and holiday-dinner ideas with their family. Or, they can create Shared Collections to organize decor inspo or Secret Santa ideas.\n“Whether it’s content from their favorite creators, inspiration for a home design project, or a new skill they’re learning together, Shared Collection makes it easy for people to stay organized as they discover and save on TikTok,” the company explained in the blog post.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nYou can only create a Shared Collection with someone if you’re both following each other. Collections can stay just between friends and family, or they can be made public. \nShared Collections are available globally to accounts of those over age 16.\nAs for Shared Feeds, which are launching in the coming months, TikTok sees them as a way for users to discover content together. Users can generate Shared Feeds in one-on-one direct messages. \nShared Feeds will surface new content tailored to both users’ tastes, such as sports or winter activities, and their favorite creators. The feeds are generated based on users’ TikTok activity, such as what they like, watch, and comment on.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s worth noting that the feeds aren’t continuous, as users will find a selection of 15 videos in their Shared Feed each day. \nImage Credits:TikTok\nThe feature is similar to Instagram Reels’ Blend feature that lets you create a custom, personalized reels feed for you and your friends.\nUsers will be able to create a Shared Feed by sending an invite to another user. Once the invitation is accepted, they can create a feed and chat about it in DMs. After both people have watched all the videos, they can view metrics, including which videos they both liked, in their “Shared Likes” history. \nTikTok also announced that it’s launching greeting cards that users can send each other.

    "body": "\nThe former chief engineer of Lucid Motors, Eric Bach, has sued the company for wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation, and claims one of the automaker’s top HR executives referred to him as a “German Nazi.” \nThe federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Northern District of California, claims Bach was stripped of his responsibilities overseeing the powertrain division in early 2025 as a result of an HR investigation into the company’s workplace culture. Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. \n“In our opinion, Mr. Bach’s legal claims are absurd,” the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We are confident that the facts revealed through the course of litigation will establish the legitimate issues leading to Mr. Bach’s termination.”\nBach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident.  \nBach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. \nHe claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.”\nThe lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV.

Lucid’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing all left within the last year, too.\nBach, in the complaint, claims to have been ascendant before the internal investigation. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” \nBach states that Lucid’s chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach’s loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose’) and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint.\nThe workplace culture investigation launched in late 2024, which Bach claims was “tainted by HR’s racist beliefs,” “initially resulted in Bach losing significant responsibilities.” The HR department told Bach at the time that he contributed to a poor culture at the company, according to the complaint. In addition to losing oversight of the powertrain team, Bach claims to have been excluded from board meetings.\nThis story has been updated with a comment from Lucid Motors.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others.\nLeading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season.\nDespite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nTiger Global, the investor that spurred the VC bull market of 2020-2021, is reportedly raising a fresh $2.2 billion fund.\nThe firm sent a letter to potential limited partners, according to a copy obtained by CNBC, seeking to raise the cash for a vehicle called Private Investment Partners 17 (PIP 17). The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness.\nDuring that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.”\nPIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported. \nIn 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups, according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations.\nWhen interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way.\nAfter the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund, and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role, while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, Bloomberg reported at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund.\nNow, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.\nStill, in a nod to the need for more caution than in previous years, the letter promised a more targeted approach. It acknowledged that leaning into AI investments could be risky and require “humility” because “valuations are elevated and, in our view, sometimes unsupported by company fundamentals,” according to CNBC. (Tiger Global could not be immediately reached for comment.)\nIn other words, even as Tiger Global raises a fresh fund to go after more big AI opportunities, it’s implying that the AI market is in a bubble, and it doesn’t want to drive valuations to even higher, perhaps unrealistic, heights.\n"

    "body": "\nLast week, pet products and services giant Petco confirmed that it experienced a data breach involving customers’ personal information, without specifying what type of data was affected.\nOn Friday, in a legally required filing with Texas’ attorney general’s office, Petco reported that the affected data included names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, financial information such as account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, and dates of birth. \nPetco filed similar legally required notices in California, Massachusetts, and Montana. In the latter two states, Petco reported one and three affected residents, respectively. \nThe company did not disclose the exact number of victims in California, where companies are required to disclose breaches involving at least 500 state residents, which suggests there are more victims than that number in the state. \nPetco spokesperson Ventura Olvera did not respond to a series of questions sent on Monday, which included how many customers in total were affected by this incident; whether Petco has any technical means, including logs, to determine whether any cybercriminals had access and stole the customers’ exposed data; what and when was the specific issue identified; and what was the application involved in the incident. \nFor context, in 2022, Petco said it served more than 24 million customers.\nOn Friday, Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCalifornia’s attorney general published a sample letter that Petco is sending to its customers.

    "body": "\nFrench AI startup Mistral today launched Devstral 2, a new generation of its AI model designed for coding, as the company seeks to catch up to bigger AI labs like Anthropic and other coding-focused LLMs.\nThis announcement follows the recent launch of the Mistral 3 family of open-weight models, and confirms Mistral’s intent to close in on its bigger and better-funded AI rivals. \nThe unicorn is also jumping into the ‘vibe-coding’ race that has fueled the rise of companies like Cursor and Supabase with Mistral Vibe, a new command-line interface (CLI) aimed at facilitating code automation through natural language, with tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution. \nMistral AI is betting on the added value of context awareness, which is particularly relevant in business use cases. Similar to its AI assistant, Le Chat, which can remember previous conversations with users and use that context to guide its answers, Vibe CLI features persistent history, and can also scan file structures and Git statuses to build context to inform its behavior.\nThis focus on production-grade workflows also explains why Devstral 2 is relatively demanding, requiring at least four H100 GPUs or equivalent for deployment, and weighing 123 billion parameters. However, the model is also available in a smaller size with Devstral Small, which, at 24 billion parameters, makes it deployable locally on consumer hardware. \nThe models differ in their open-source licensing — Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small uses Apache 2.0. \nThey also differ in pricing. Devstral 2 is currently free to use via the company’s API. After the free period, the API pricing will cost $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2, and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMistral has partnered with agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to release Devstral 2 to users, while Mistral Vibe CLI is available as an extension in Zed for use inside the IDE.\nEurope’s champion AI lab, Mistral is currently valued at €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) following a Series C funding round led by Dutch semiconductor company ASML, which invested €1.3 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) in September.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nAn increasing number of browsers are experimenting with agentic features that will take actions on your behalf, such as booking tickets or shopping for different items. However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. \nGoogle detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months.\nThe company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.\nImage Credits:Google\nWhat’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.\n“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. \nGoogle is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.\nImage Credits:google\nThe search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. \nAI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released a new open source content detection model to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAdvanced Nvidia AI chips can head back to China after all.\nThe Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor, to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales, CNBC reported. \nH200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”\nThe news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump’s hands.\nThe decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security.\nPete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips.\nWhile Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.\nThe Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with licensing requirements to send their chips to China in April before it formally rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule that would have regulated AI chip exports in May. Over the summer, the U.S. government signaled that companies would be able to start sending chips to China as long as the government got a 15% cut of all revenue, as chips became a bargaining tool in trade talks with China.\nHowever, by that point, the market for U.S.-developed chips in China was strained.\nIn September, China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic companies from buying Nvidia’s chips, leaving companies in the country to rely on less advanced domestic chips from Alibaba and Huawei.\nOn Monday, Trump said that Chinese president Xi Jinping “responded positively” to the latest H200 news in a Truth Social post. \nThis story was updated on December 8 when the proposed decision was confirmed. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

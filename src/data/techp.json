    "body": "\nIf you work in tech, Wired’s new cover story isn’t exactly going to shatter your worldview, but it’s a genuinely great read all the same.\nReporter Zoë Bernard spent months talking to 51 people (31 of them gay men) to map out a subculture that’s been an open secret in Silicon Valley for years: gay men, at the upper echelons of tech, quietly raising up their own networks the way powerful people have always done.\nOne angel investor puts it plainly: “The gays who work in tech are succeeding vastly… they support each other, whether that’s to hire someone or angel invest in their companies or lead their funding rounds.” Another source frames it almost philosophically: “Straight guys have the golf course. Gay guys have the orgy. It doesn’t mean it’s problematic. It’s a way we bond and connect.”\nThe piece doesn’t let the culture off the hook entirely. As is true wherever power dynamics exist, nine of the gay men interviewed describe experiencing unwanted advances from more senior colleagues — and Bernard doesn’t shy from examining where networking ends and coercion begins. But her sources are careful about what that means: “This is a complex subject and I don’t think readers can draw the distinction between some bad men being gay and all gay men being bad. It can be a slippery slope into homophobia.”\n"

If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.\nWith a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It’s unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.\nThe Japanese investor is a partner in the Stargate project with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are in the process of building a “proof of concept” data center at GM’s former Lordstown automotive assembly plant.\nA power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to our calculations based on public, energy-use metrics. When including methane leaks from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could be even bigger. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Climate\n\n"

    "body": "\nSnap has big plans to release the newest version of its AR glasses, Specs, later this year. Despite the strategic priority that the hardware product represents, the company recently shed one of the top executives tied to the project, reportedly over a dispute with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. \nThe tech blog Sources originally reported that the company had recently lost Scott Myers, its SVP of Specs, over a supposed “blow-up” with Spiegel.\nWhen reached for comment by TechCrunch, a Snap spokesperson said that Myers had “decided to step down from his role at Snap.” The statement thanked him for his contributions, and wished him “the best in his next chapter.” The spokesperson also disputed the “blow-up” characterization but wouldn’t reveal more about Myers’ departure. \nThe spokesperson added: “We can’t wait to bring Specs to the world later this year. We remain focused on disciplined execution and long-term value creation for our developer partners, community and shareholders.”\nIt’s unclear when exactly Myers left the company, or what the alleged “blow-up” might have entailed. When a user on X asked Sources author Alex Heath about the nature of the reported dispute, he replied that it was about “strategy,” adding that he couldn’t reveal more.\nSnap has teased the commercial release of Specs for quite a while and, in recent months, has signaled that it’s getting serious about the product’s launch. In January, the company spun off the Specs team into its own distinct subsidiary, Specs Inc., saying that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.” \nMyers joined the Snap team in 2020 and, prior to that, held roles at SpaceX, Apple, and Nokia, according to his LinkedIn profile. In an interview with Tom’s Guide last summer, Myers called the development process for Specs an “entirely new paradigm” but also discussed the tricky nature of getting its form factor just right. “I don’t want to see people wearing a wire coming out of the back of their head,” he quipped.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nNvidia is stepping up efforts to court India’s artificial intelligence startups earlier in their lifecycle, unveiling a string of partnerships this week aimed at reaching founders even before their companies are formally established. The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.\nThe latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firm Activate, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.\nThe flurry of activity comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.\nIndia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.\nAakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.\nThe VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.\nFor Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through its Inception program, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker also expanded its local ecosystem ties, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.\nThe company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidia joined the India Deep Tech Alliance, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.\nVaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.\nThe stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA year ago, Redwood Materials didn’t have an energy storage business. Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.\nThe evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at its R&D lab in San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.\nThe San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.\nThe company said in a blog post Thursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent $425 million Series E raise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.  \n“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind. \nData centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity. \n“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRedwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells. \nThe company opened Redwood Energy last summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood set up an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project. \nMcConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.\n“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAfter a year-long pilot project, Toyota’s Canadian manufacturing subsidiary has contracted seven humanoid robots to work in a plant building RAV4 SUVs under a robots-as-a-service deal.\n“After evaluating a number of robots, we are excited to deploy Digit to improve the team member experience and further increase operational efficiency in our manufacturing facilities,” Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (TMMC) President Tim Hollander said in a statement.\nThe Digit robot in question is built by Agility Robotics, a firm spun out of Oregon State University in 2015. Digit is intended to work in industrial environments without humans nearby, often bridging two automated production lines. In this case, the robots will be unloading totes full of auto parts from an automated warehouse tugger.\nWhile seven robots doing manual drudgery may seem a small step compared to sizzle reels of metal humans doing backflips, actually deploying humanoid robots in real workplaces is rare and difficult. Demonstrating a capability in a lab is one thing, but integrating it into a company’s workflow — including maintenance and charging — isn’t easy. \n“When the tech companies spend real time in the field understanding the task that needs to be operated, the real workflows that happens…that’s when we will see a huge uptick in adoption,” Ram Devarajulu, a VP at Cambridge Consultants, said at the Humanoids Summit in late 2025. \nAgility is among the leaders in getting robots out of the lab, with Digits working in similar capacities for logistics providers like GXO, Schaeffler, and Amazon. The company has a proprietary cloud-based software package called Arc for users to manage fleets of their robots, and says AI will be vital in reducing deployment costs. \n“Cost of deployment … can be more than the price of the robot by a lot,” Pras Velagapudi, Agility’s CTO, said in an interview last year. “AI tools let us decrease that cost of deployment, decrease the amount of time getting the robot configured and getting it operating at a level of performance that they want.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTMMC and Agility will use this engagement as an opportunity to pioneer other use cases that relieve human workers of repetitive physical tasks and prioritize more valuable work. \nThe company is also preparing a next-generation robot that will be safe to operate alongside human workers; current humanoid robots that are strong enough to lift heavy loads are still considered too unreliable to operate autonomously around people.\nCompetitor Figure AI tested its Figure 02 robots in a BMW factory for 10 months last year, which the company said unloaded 90,000 parts. Other companies deploying humanoids in pilot programs include Apptronic, Unitree, Tesla, Boston Dynamics, 1X Technology, and Reflex Robotics. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tTim Fernholz is a journalist who writes about technology, finance and public policy.

    "body": "\nThe race to advance conversational AI in the living room is heating up, with YouTube being the latest to expand its tool to smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices. \nThis experimental feature, previously limited to mobile devices and the web, now brings conversational AI directly to the largest screen in the home, allowing users to ask questions about content without leaving the video they’re watching. \nAccording to YouTube’s support page, eligible users can click the “Ask” button on their TV screen to summon the AI assistant. The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app. \nCurrently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.\nYouTube first launched this conversational AI tool in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A Nielsen report from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.\nOther companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out Alexa+ on Fire TV devices, enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.\nMeanwhile, Roku has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?” Netflix is also testing its AI search experience. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother way YouTube has tried to improve its TV experience with AI is the recent launch of a feature that automatically enhances to full HD videos uploaded at lower resolutions.\nAdditionally, the company continues to launch other AI features, like a comments summarizer that helps viewers catch up on video discussions and an AI-driven search results carousel. In January, the company announced that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using AI-generated versions of their own likeness. \nLast week, YouTube launched a dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro, too, letting users watch their favorite content on a theater-sized virtual screen in an immersive environment.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nFewer bad actors are targeting Google Play with malicious apps, the company says, a shift that the tech giant credits with its increased investments in proactive security systems and AI technology.\nIn its latest Android app ecosystem safety report released on Thursday, Google said it prevented 1.75 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play in 2025, down from 2.36 million in 2024 and 2.28 million in 2023.\nThe annual report offers a look at how Google is keeping Android users safe by reviewing and monitoring apps to protect against malware, financial fraud, privacy invasions, sneaky subscriptions, and other threats. \nFor instance, Google says it banned more than 80,000 developer accounts in 2025 that had tried to publish these types of bad apps. That figure is also down year-over-year from 158,000 in 2024, and 333,000 in 2023.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle touted how its investments in AI and other real-time defenses have helped fight these sorts of threats, but also how they served as a deterrent. \n“Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,” the company’s blog post explained, adding that its “AI-powered, multi-layer protections” have been “discouraging bad actors from publishing malicious apps.”\nGoogle noted it now runs over 10,000 safety checks on every app it publishes and continues to recheck apps after publication. The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.\nIn addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from 1.3 million in 2024. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by review bombing.\nMeanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSpaceX’s company town in Texas, Starbase, is less than a year old, but it already has its own volunteer fire department and is working on creating a police department. Now it wants its own court, too. \nStarbase’s city administrator submitted a proposed ordinance to the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.\nThe formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services. \nIn addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the city decided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.) \nStarbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months. \nDuring Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.\nThe city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.\n“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nWaymo’s big chance to bring its robotaxis to the state of New York has been thwarted — for now. \nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul withdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws to effectively legalize robotaxis in the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled. \n“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was the first to report the proposal had been removed.\nThe withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.\n“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. \n“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”\n“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHochul had introduced, as part of her broader budget proposal, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.\nEven if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.\nWith that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.\nWaymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31. \nNew York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.\nWaymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting 1 million weekly rides by the end of the year.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nMeta is shutting down its standalone Messenger website, the company shared in a help page. Starting April 2026, the website will no longer be available. If users still want to send and receive messages on the web, they can do so while logged into Facebook. \n“After messenger.com goes away, you will be automatically redirected to use facebook.com/messages for messaging on a computer,” the help page reads. “You can continue your conversations there or on the Messenger mobile app.” \nIf you use Messenger without a Facebook account, then you’ll only be able to continue your conversations on the Messenger mobile app. Users can restore their chat history on any platform using the PIN they entered when they first created a backup on Messenger. If you can’t remember your PIN, you can reset it.\nThe move comes a few months after Meta shut down Messenger’s standalone desktop apps for Windows and Mac. The writing may have been on the wall at the time, as Meta had been redirecting existing desktop app users to the Facebook website to continue using the messaging service, rather than the Messenger website.\nThe change was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi. Meta is notifying users of the update via a pop-up message on the Messenger website and app. \nUsers have taken to social media to express their frustration with the update, with many saying they don’t want to rely on the Facebook website to send and receive Messenger chats on the web, especially those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts. \nWhile Meta’s decision to shut down various Messenger platforms is frustrating for users, it allows the tech giant to reduce costs by leaving it with fewer platforms to maintain.\nMessenger first launched as “Facebook Chat” back in 2008, and Facebook (now Meta) launched Facebook Messenger as a standalone app in 2011. Over the years, the tech giant positioned Messenger as its own service outside of Facebook, and in 2014, the social network removed messaging capabilities from its main mobile app to push people to the Messenger app. However, the company reversed this in 2023 when it began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in court on Wednesday in a landmark trial aiming to determine if the tech giant’s social media applications are addictive and harmful to teens and kids. The trial, taking place in LA Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s own research indicated that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.\nLawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier congressional hearing that this was not the case, the AP noted, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase users’ time spent in app by 12%.\nZuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One Meta document from 2018 stated that, as of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.\nHere, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its own age assurance tools for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where many states have now created or are developing their own social media laws.)\nReports from the courtroom noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were taking things out of context or mischaracterizing what documents said.\nPlaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. TikTok and Snap settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success. \nDuring the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

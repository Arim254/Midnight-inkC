    "body": "\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is finally ready to try a second launch of its super heavy-lift rocket New Glenn. The company announced on Wednesday that it will attempt the launch as early as Sunday, November 9, from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nNew Glenn’s first flight took place back in January, and it was mostly successful. The rocket’s second stage made it into orbit, but the first stage exploded on its return to Earth before Blue Origin could attempt to land it on a drone ship in the ocean.\nEarlier this year, the company said it would try to launch New Glenn for a second time in “late spring.” That timeline slipped a few times, though. Blue Origin is being extra careful with the second launch in part because it will be carrying cargo on behalf of paying customers this time. The main cargo is NASA’s twin ESCAPADE spacecraft, which are headed to Mars. A Viasat tech demonstrator will also be on board.\n"

    "body": "\nExecutives at Ford are considering killing its flagship electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThe discussions are happening in the wake of Ford’s late October decision to idle F-150 Lightning production while it prioritizes hybrid and gas-engine versions of the popular pickup. The company’s been dealing with production troubles after a fire broke out at aluminum supplier Novelis’ factory in Oswego, New York, earlier this year.\nFord introduced the F-150 Lightning in 2021 with a promised base price of $40,000. It started building and selling the truck in 2022 — although the truck wound up costing most customers a lot more. \nBut while it’s been one of the top-selling electric trucks in the United States since then, Ford has struggled to sell more than a few thousand of them per quarter. The market for electric trucks was tough even before Republicans in Congress ended the federal EV tax credit and the Trump administration took an axe to emissions regulations that encouraged the adoption of electric vehicles.\n"

So far, users either had to link their account to services like Last.fm to track their music, or wait until the end of the year for Spotify to release its personalized year-in-review, Wrapped, to find out what they listened to.\nThe streaming giant is now changing that with a new feature called “Listening stats” that will show users weekly numbers about their listening habits.\nStats will surface your top artists and top songs for a particular week, and will let you share those numbers with others using Instagram or WhatsApp, or with your friends directly on Spotify through the app’s new messaging feature. Spotify said the weekly highlights will also include special moments, like a milestone, a newdiscovery, or a fan moment.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nThe stats page also has an option to create a playlist based on the songs you already like and what you might want to listen to next based on your listening habits.\nTo access your stats, tap on your profile image, and then select the “Listening stats” tab. From there, you will be able to check out what you’ve been listening to, and share the stats.\nListening stats is currently rolling out to free and premium users in over 60 countries. Spotify said it will still release annual recaps via Wrapped, which is usually highly anticipated, as users get to share each other’s top artists and other insights. \nThe new listening stats might give users a better understanding of their listening patterns on a more regular basis, but it might kill the surprise element of discovering some tidbits about themselves at the end of the year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

    "body": "\nLucid Motors’ chief engineer Eric Bach is leaving the company after more than a decade, the company has announced.\nBach, who also served as Lucid Motors’ Senior Vice President of Product, has been with the company since 2015. He joined Lucid after spending three years as Tesla’s Director of Engineering, where he worked alongside Lucid Motors’ former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. Bach spent more than 10 years at Volkswagen before Tesla.\nTechCrunch has learned that Lucid’s VP of Engineering, James Hawkins, is also no longer with the company after spending 10 years there. Lucid Motors declined to specifically comment on his departure.  \nBach’s and Hawkins’ departures are part of a wider shake-up announced Wednesday. Lucid Motors’ Vice President of Quality, Jeri Ford, is retiring as well. She will be replaced by Marnie Levergood, who is coming to the company from Scout Motors.\nAt the same time, Lucid Motors’ current Senior Vice President of Powertrain, Emad Dlala, is being elevated to oversee all of “Engineering and Digital.” Dlala was promoted once already earlier this year and has been with the company since 2015.\nThe executive shake-up comes as Lucid enters its ninth month without a permanent CEO after Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February. Former chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff has been serving as CEO on an interim basis ever since.\nThe loss of Bach and Ford is the latest in a line of executive departures at Lucid Motors. The company’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing have all left within the last year.\nThe changes are happening at a critical moment in Lucid Motors’ history. The company finally launched its long-awaited luxury SUV, the Gravity, which the company expects will ultimately be more successful than the Air sedan, which it has struggled to sell. \nLucid Motors is also working on a midsized vehicle that will be priced closer to $50,000 in 2026, though it has said it likely needs to raise more money before that happens. On Wednesday, Lucid Motors announced that its majority owner — Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund — had boosted the cap of a loan agreement from $750 million to around $2 billion, which provides the company liquidity until 2027.\nThis story has been updated with more information about departures and the amended loan agreement announced Wednesday.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

The CPSC is warning Peloton users to “immediately stop using the recalled exercise bikes.” \n“The integrity of our products and our Members’ well-being are our top priorities,” said Márcio Oliveira, Peloton’s SVP of Global Hardware Operations and Product Safety, in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “We are taking this opportunity to make replacement seat posts available to all affected Bike+ users and we encourage them to contact us to receive the redesigned seat post as soon as possible.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Peloton has issued a recall. The company recalled around 2.2 million exercise bikes over safety concerns in 2023 after reports of customer injuries.\nThursday’s recall marks the latest setback for Peloton, which replaced its CEO and laid off hundreds of workers last year. The company is scheduled to release its latest earnings report on Thursday amid efforts to revive growth after a decline in post-pandemic sales. Since reaching its peak in January 2021, Peloton’s stock has fallen by over 90%.\nAs part of the company’s efforts to revive its business, Peloton recently announced its biggest launch in years.

On Thursday, the company added more commercial contracts to that total. International Airlines Group announced it will install Starlink inflight internet on more than 500 aircraft across its portfolio, which includes British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.\nThe additional EchoStar spectrum will be used to grow Starlink’s nascent “direct to cell” constellation, which initially lets T-Mobile customers access satellite-based 5G internet. \nEchoStar started unloading its spectrum licenses earlier this year after pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and the Trump administration. Trump personally told EchoStar’s CEO to sell the licenses, according to Bloomberg. Its sale to SpaceX in September effectively ended EchoStar’s own to plans build a direct-to-device satellite constellation. However, SpaceX hasn’t been the only buyer of EchoStar’s spectrum. In August, the company sold $23 billion worth of spectrum licenses to AT&T.\nThe deal with International Airlines Group will see Starlink added to planes beginning in 2026. The European group will make Starlink available on short-haul, long-haul, and global routes — essentially every plane not slated for retirement, according to a press release.\nStarlink has been creeping across the aviation industry the last few years. It started with smaller jets and private planes in 2022, but has quickly racked up big commercial partnerships, with Hawaiian airlines being the first. United Airlines announced a deal to integrate Starlink internet in late 2024 and then accelerated the rollout earlier this year. Qatar Airways outfitted dozens of its wide-body planes with Starlink this year, too.\nAll of this has helped SpaceX notch more than 8 million customers for Starlink across 150 different countries.

On its first day on the Google Play Store, the AI video app from ChatGPT maker OpenAI saw an estimated 470,000 downloads across the markets where it was available, according to new estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures.\nThat makes the Android launch more than 4x the size of the iOS launch, with 327% more installs (360,000) — but the firm notes that’s not an apples-to-apples comparison.\nOn iOS, Sora was only available in the U.S. and Canada, and it was invite-only. \nSora on Android, however, is available in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, and OpenAI dropped the invite requirement in late October for its top markets.\n\nYou can now get into the Sora app without an invite code in the US, Canada, Japan, and Korea.Limited time only.— OpenAI (@OpenAI) October 29, 2025\n\nThe app was a breakout hit following its debut, despite its earlier exclusive status. The iOS app hit over a million installs within its first week and quickly jumped to the top of the App Store. Today, it’s still ranking as the No. 4 app on the U.S. App Store’s iPhone Top Free Charts.\nWith Sora, users leverage AI to make videos using prompts. These videos can also include the users and their friends animated by AI, via a feature known as Cameos. Videos are scrollable in a TikTok-like vertical feed, so you can see what other people are making with the technology.\nAppfigures has also revised its earlier estimates for first-day iOS downloads of the Sora app. Originally, its models said the app saw around 56,000 day-one downloads. Now that more time has passed, the model can more accurately predict that the figure was closer to 110,000, with about 69,300 of those being U.S. installs.\nBy comparison, the Sora Android app saw approximately 296,000 U.S.-based installs, out of the 470,000 total, indicating there’s still interest in the AI video maker, even after the initial iOS launch buzz wore off.\nSora also competes with Meta AI, which released its mobile app to European users today, following its earlier U.S. debut.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWith so much money flooding into AI startups, it’s a good time to be an AI researcher with an idea to test out. And if the idea is novel enough, it might be easier to get the resources you need as an independent company instead of inside one of the big labs.\nThat’s the story of Inception, a startup developing diffusion-based AI models that just raised $50 million in seed funding. The round was led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Mayfield, Innovation Endeavors, Microsoft’s M12 fund, Snowflake Ventures, Databricks Investment, and Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures. Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy provided additional angel funding.\nThe leader of the project is Stanford professor Stefano Ermon, whose research focuses on diffusion models — which generate outputs through iterative refinement rather than word-by-word. These models power image-based AI systems like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Sora. Having worked on those systems since before the AI boom made them exciting, Ermon is using Inception to apply the same models to a broader range of tasks.\nTogether with the funding, the company released a new version of its Mercury model, designed for software development. Mercury has already been integrated into a number of development tools, including ProxyAI, Buildglare, and Kilo Code. Most importantly, Ermon says the diffusion approach will help Inception’s models conserve on two of the most important metrics: latency (response time) and compute cost.\n“These diffusion-based LLMs are much faster and much more efficient than what everybody else is building today,” Ermon says. “It’s just a completely different approach where there is a lot of innovation that can still be brought to the table.”\nUnderstanding the technical difference requires a bit of background. Diffusion models are structurally different from auto-regression models, which dominate text-based AI services. Auto-regression models like GPT-5 and Gemini work sequentially, predicting each next word or word fragment based on the previously processed material. Diffusion models, trained for image generation, take a more holistic approach, modifying the overall structure of a response incrementally until it matches the desired result.\nThe conventional wisdom is to use auto-regression models for text applications, and that approach has been hugely successful for recent generations of AI models. But a growing body of research suggests diffusion models may perform better when a model is processing large quantities of text or managing data constraints. As Ermon tells it, those qualities become a real advantage when performing operations over large codebases.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDiffusion models also have more flexibility in how they utilize hardware, a particularly important advantage as the infrastructure demands of AI become clear. Where auto-regression models have to execute operations one after another, diffusion models can process many operations simultaneously, allowing for significantly lower latency in complex tasks.\n“We’ve been benchmarked at over 1,000 tokens per second, which is way higher than anything that’s possible using the existing autoregressive technologies,” Ermon says, “because our thing is built to be parallel. It’s built to be really, really fast.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

You can add new visuals, layer in music, or adjust styles to match your individual taste.\n“This is an inherently social and collaborative creation experience, where you’re encouraged to remix, co-create, and build stories together with friends,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “Videos and content can be shared and posted directly to the Vibes feed, sent to friends, or cross-posted to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.”\nImage Credits:Meta\nWhen Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the feed in September, the user comments in response to his announcement post were about what you’d expect, especially since no one really wants an AI-generated version of TikTok.\nOne of the top comments on the post read: “gang nobody wants this,” while another popular comment said: “Bro’s posting ai slop on his own app.” Another comment read: “I think I speak for everyone when I say: What….?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile Meta is embracing AI-generated content, companies like YouTube are looking to crack down on the issue, as the rise of AI technology has caused social media platforms to become flooded with AI slop — a term meaning low-quality AI content. \nMeta’s debut of Vibes is particularly puzzling, given that the company said earlier this year that it was tackling “unoriginal” content and advised creators to focus on “authentic storytelling,” rather than short videos offering little value.\nDespite its earlier messaging, Meta is touting the launch of Vibes, stating that media generation in the Meta AI app has jumped more than tenfold since its launch.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDiscord has rolled out updates to its Family Center, giving guardians more insights into their teens’ usage patterns, including purchases, top interactions, and time spent. The goal is to help parents monitor whether their teen is spending excessive time or money on Discord.\nThe communication platform first launched Family Center in 2023 with an activity dashboard showing which servers their teens have joined and a weekly email summary for guardians about their teen’s activity. The platform is now expanding these monitoring abilities.\nGuardians can now see total purchases made by the teen in the last week, including items from Discord’s Shop and Nitro subscriptions (Discord’s premium membership service).\nImage Credits:Discord\nThey can also view the total time spent on voice and video calls in DMs, groups, and servers over the past week. Plus, Discord will display the top five users and servers teens interacted with in the last seven days. This comes after social networks Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat have implemented restrictions on who can contact teens.\nDiscord is also adding new parental controls to the app with settings that can only be altered by guardians. They can now control who can DM their teen and whether sensitive content should be filtered. Guardians can also manage data privacy controls for teens, determining how Discord uses their data, including whether to show them personalized ads.\nImage Credits:Discord\nThe company also said that when teens report content on the platform, they now have an option to notify their parents or guardians of their action. However, Discord said it won’t disclose what content was reported and encourages teens to discuss this directly with their guardians instead.\n“The new features allow guardians who have linked Family Center accounts to play a more active role in creating a safer space online for teens while still respecting their privacy,” Discord said in a blog post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, several companies, including Meta, YouTube, and OpenAI, have rolled out updates to bolster their tools around teen safety.

    "body": "\nGoogle is adding Gemini to Maps in India, along with road safety alerts and more information about routes.\nThe AI integration, launched in the U.S. on Wednesday, brings hands-free AI assistance to Maps, as well as contextual suggestions while navigating and information about places of interest. \nMiriam Daniel, vice president and head of Google Maps, said the rollout required significant localization.\n“When we say localizing for India, it’s not just the language,” she said at a virtual briefing. “It’s also adapting to how Indians use the product, how Indians will talk, how they will ask for questions, how they will identify places, the geopolitical places, the street names, you know, everything is sort of different in India.”\nGemini in Maps will be available to all Android and iOS users in India in the coming weeks, Google said. At launch, Gemini will support nine Indian languages.\nGoogle is also adding a set of India-specific navigation and commuting updates. Drivers will now get visual and audio alerts when they’re passing accident-prone stretches. Google said it is working on these alerts with local authorities, and the feature will roll out to Android users in Gurugram, the Cyberabad region of Hyderabad, Chandigarh, and Faridabad.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle has come under scrutiny in India over the reliability of some navigation routes, after a car drove off an unfinished bridge in Uttar Pradesh, killing three men, late last year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The real-world conditions can keep changing, and it’s very dynamic, and sometimes it changes in an instant. Maps can’t be accurate 100% of the time,” said Anal Ghosh, senior program manager for Google Maps, when asked about warnings for incomplete roads or unfinished bridges. “So we would encourage users to ensure that they’re keeping their eyes on the road.”\nGoogle said it has partnered with the country’s highways regulator, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), to receive near real-time data on road closures, diversions, and repair work. The company said the partnership will also allow Maps to show wayside amenities such as public restrooms, restaurants, and fuel stations along national highways.\nOther new features include proactive notifications about major disruptions or delays on routes, even when users are not navigating. These alerts are rolling out to Android users for highways and major roads in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe app will also display speed limits during navigation, using data from local traffic authorities. This feature is rolling out to Android and iOS users in nine cities: Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Hyderabad (including the Cyberabad region), Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida.\nBuilding on the flyover navigation feature launched last year, Maps is now getting voice support for flyovers.

    "body": "\nFrancesco Nicodemo, a consultant who works with left-wing politicians in Italy, has gone public as the latest person targeted with Paragon spyware in the country. \nOn Thursday, Nicodemo said in a Facebook post that for 10 months, he preferred not to publicize his case because he “did not want to be used for political propaganda,” but now “the time has come.”  \n“It is time to ask a very simple question: Why? Why me? How is it possible that such a sophisticated and complex tool was used to spy on a private citizen, as if he were a drug trafficker or a subversive threat to the country?” Nicodemo wrote. “I have nothing more to say. Others must speak. Others must explain what happened.” \nOnline news site Fanpage first reported the news that Nicodemo was among the people who received a WhatsApp notification in January.  \nThe revelation that Nicodemo was targeted with Paragon spyware widens the scope — once again — of the ongoing spyware scandal in Italy, which has ensnared several victims from various positions in society: several journalists, immigration activists, prominent business executives, and now a political consultant with a history of working for the center-left Partito Democratico (Democratic Party) and its politicians.\nGovernments and spyware makers have long claimed that their surveillance products are used against serious criminals and terrorists, but these recent cases show that this isn’t always true. \n“The Italian government has given some spyware targets clarity and explained the cases. But others remain troublingly unclear,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, who has for years investigated spyware companies and their abuses, including some involving the use of Paragon spyware.  \n“None of this looks good for Paragon, or for Italy. That’s why clarity from the Italian government is so essential. I believe that if they wanted to, Paragon could give everybody a lot more clarity on what’s going on. Until they do, these cases are going to remain a weight around their neck,” said Scott-Railton, who confirmed that Nicodemo received the notification from WhatsApp. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Paragon, and this spyware campaign? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nNatale De Gregorio, who works with Nicodemo at their public relations firm Lievito Consulting, told TechCrunch in an email that Nicodemo did not want to comment beyond what he told Fanpage and his public Facebook post. \nAt this point, it’s unclear who among Paragon customers targeted Nicodemo, but an Italian parliamentary committee confirmed in June that some of the victims in Italy were targeted by Italian intelligence agencies, which are under the purview of right-wing prime minister Giorgia Meloni. \nA spokesperson for the Italian prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch.  \nJennifer Iras, the vice president of marketing for REDLattice, a cybersecurity company that has merged with Paragon after the Israeli spyware maker was acquired by U.S. private equity giant AE Industrial, also did not respond to a request for comment. \nIn February, following the revelations of the first wave of victims in Italy, Paragon cut ties with its government customers in Italy, specifically the intelligence agencies AISE and AISI.  \nLater in June, the Italian Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic, known as COPASIR, concluded that some of the Paragon spyware victims that had been identified publicly, namely the immigration activists, were lawfully hacked by Italian intelligence services.  \nCOPASIR, however, said there was no evidence that Francesco Cancellato, the director of Fanpage.it, an Italian news website that has investigated the youth wing of the far-right ruling party in Italy, led by Meloni, had been targeted by either of Italy’s intelligence agencies, the AISI and AISE.  \nCOPASIR also did not investigate the case of Cancellato’s colleague Ciro Pellegrino. \nParagon, which told TechCrunch that the U.S. government is one of its customers, has an active contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nDecentralized open source social network Mastodon is rolling out its latest release, version 4.5, which brings support for Quote Posts to all server operators, along with other features for admins, conversation improvements, and more.\nThe addition of quote posts is one of the bigger changes to how Mastodon’s social network operates, as the social network attempts to compete against larger rivals, like X and Threads. Quoting can be a conversation driver and is considered a baseline feature for text-first social networks. But Mastodon wanted to ensure the feature launched with more user protections so as not to change the culture of its network.\nOn X, quote posts (formerly known as retweets when X was Twitter) contributed to a culture of “dunking,” where users would often deride others by responding to their post with cruel jokes or insults. That remains a concern today among other new competitors, like Threads and Bluesky.\nTo address this problem, Mastodon’s version of quote posts comes with added safety controls.\nImage Credits:Mastodon\nThe feature was also initially rolled out to the larger Mastodon servers at mastodon.online and mastodon.social in September, ahead of the 4.5 software update, giving users time to adjust the format.\nMastodon gives users several ways to control how their posts can be quoted. For instance, users decide who can quote them through the feature’s settings. Here, you can choose between options like “Anyone,” “Followers only,” or “Just me.” Additionally, users can control the visibility of quote posts by setting them to be visible to the public, to followers only, or a setting called “quiet public,” which makes the quotes public but removes them from Mastodon’s search, trends, and public timeline.\nIn addition, users can override their default settings on a post-by-post basis, if need be, which could be useful at those times when you want to quote someone without attracting unwanted attention. \nMastodon will also alert the user being quoted in the app, so they can remove their original post from the other person’s quote post, if they feel the need to. Plus, users can opt to block others to prevent them from seeing and quoting their posts in the future.\nWhile the broader rollout of quote posts is the major addition in the 4.5 software release, the update also fixes issues where users on older servers running 4.4 and earlier versions would sometimes miss seeing replies.\nImage Credits:Mastodon\nServer operators are also gaining new tools to optionally disable content feeds, set a local feed as their homepage, block specific users, and more. The moderation interface has been updated to display needed context, like link previews and quote posts in messages, to aid in decision-making. \nImage Credits:Mastodon\nMeanwhile, the 4.5 release also brings native emoji support to Mastodon’s web interface. \nMastodon continues to be one of the larger networks on the fediverse, the name for the open social web powered by the ActivityPub social networking protocol. Overall, the fediverse has nearly 12 million users, according to growth tracker FediDB, with Mastodon accounting for north of 8 million of that figure. However, its monthly active user number is only ~670,000.\nThreads, which integrates with ActivityPub, isn’t counted in these figures because it’s not a full integration. Threads has more than 400 million monthly users and 150 million daily active users.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nLagos-based Ventures Platform, one of Africa’s most active early-stage investors, has raised $64 million so far for its second fund, targeting a final close of $75 million, founding partner Kola Aina tells TechCrunch.\nAmong the investors is the Nigerian government, through its Investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises (iDICE) program, which marks the first time this government has invested in a VC fund. That’s significant, since Nigeria’s burgeoning startup community is home to the largest number of startup unicorns on the continent.\nOther limited partners in Ventures Platform’s second fund include IFC, British International Investment (BII), Proparco, Standard Bank, MSMEDA, and AfricaGrow, along with European family offices such as Alder Tree Investment and prominent global backers like former Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel. Aina says 70% of the investors from its previous fund returned.\nNigeria choosing this firm for a debut investment is perhaps not surprising. Since its founding in 2016, Ventures Platform has built a reputation for spotting breakout startups in the country early, something it hopes to replicate in other African markets.\nVentures Platform launched its first institutional fund, a $46 million vehicle, in 2022 to focus primarily on pre-seed and seed rounds.\nWith the second fund, the firm will also pursue Series A investing, while “investing with more conviction” and seeking larger ownership stakes, Aina said. This should be good news for the region’s founders, as Series A funding has become harder to obtain after years of pullback from Silicon Valley firms.\nWhile Ventures Platform plans to deepen its presence in Nigeria, the firm has begun establishing a presence in Francophone West Africa and North Africa, regions where it has already made a few investments, to gain earlier access to promising deals.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo far, the Pan-African venture capital firm has funded over 90 startups across the continent. Most of these investments, the firm says, are “painkiller” businesses across fintech, health tech, agtech, edtech, and AI — companies that solve for non-consumption, or in simpler terms, serve markets where people have little to no access to a service.\nAina points to portfolio companies Visa-backed unicorn Moniepoint and Stripe-owned Paystack, two fintechs that unlocked new markets for online payments and small business banking.\n“Many small businesses couldn’t sell beyond their immediate vicinity before Paystack because they couldn’t accept online payments,” he said. “Moniepoint, on the other hand, has driven financial inclusion to the nooks and crannies of this country. That’s market creating innovation.”\nOther notable portfolio companies include Left Lane-backed remittance app LemFi, Gates Foundation-backed SeamlessHR, Norfund-backed OmniRetail, QED-backed fintech Raenest, and health tech Remedial Health.\nEven as innovation accelerates and funding in Africa’s tech ecosystem has surpassed $12 billion since 2015, stakeholders are voicing fresh concerns about the shortage of exits and liquidity events. That reality has made fundraising harder for many of the continent’s VCs, most of them emerging managers who, as a collective globally, have faced a tough climate over the past two years.\nVentures Platform, however, in that time, managed to attract both local and international LPs for two funds despite the market uncertainty.\n“We have LPs who understand how venture ecosystems in other markets have developed and know we’ll get there in the long term. Another reason is that we’ve recycled capital from our prior syndicates,” Aina said, referring to the firm returning four out of its six vintages (including five angel syndicates) between 2016 and 2022. The investor also claims that the first fund ranks among the top performers globally based on TVPI and IRR for its vintage year.\nStill addressing questions around exits as well as the continent’s funding slowdown (from $5 billion in 2021 to $2 billion last year), Aina adds that Africa’s long-term potential hasn’t waned and describes the continent as the “purest asymmetric play for non-consensus alpha” — venture-speak for high-risk, high-upside bets.\n“If you’re a global capital allocator looking for true diversification, Africa is the place,” he said. “By 2050, one in four humans will be African. Our GDP growth rate is double that of the U.S., and yet most of the value is still offline. The opportunity is huge if you have the patience and the local context.”\n"

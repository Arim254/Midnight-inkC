The reason I came up with this is, if you look at the history of venture capital, it’s an asset that’s uncorrelated with other asset classes.”\n“And so the thinking for many allocators was you should allocate a certain percentage of your portfolio to this and more money should flow to venture capital, but the truth is that there are only so many companies that matter,” Botha continued. \n“In my opinion, throwing more money into Silicon Valley doesn’t yield more great companies. It actually dilutes that, it actually makes it harder for us to get that small number of special companies to flourish,” added Botha.\nBotha noted that there are currently 3,000 venture firms in the United States, while there were just 1,000 when he joined Sequoia 20 years ago.\n“When I joined Sequoia 2003 there were no mobile devices,” said Botha “Cloud computing didn’t exist. There were maybe 300 million people on the planet that had access to the internet. So the scale of the opportunity today is completely different. If you look technically at the numbers, I think for the last 20 years, there’s roughly been 380 billion-dollar-plus outcomes in the industry,” Botha said (meaning roughly 20 per year).\n“That’s a significant number, but I don’t think it will continue to scale just with more money going into the industry.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

Speaking on stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday, Yuan discussed his videoconferencing product’s embrace of AI, which includes a “digital twin” feature where an AI avatar can speak for you. \nYuan began using his AI avatar in an earnings call with investors this year, demonstrating the technology’s potential and ability to push the “boundaries of communication,” he said.\nAt Disrupt, the exec emphasized spending a lot of time talking about AI and the right products to bring to market. \nWhen asked about what he’s investing in, he responded, “AI, AI, and AI.” The technology is the subject of multi-hour strategy meetings, as Zoom believes in its potential to transform work.\nYuan also suggested there were many more use cases for AI companions, beyond just video conferencing stand-ins. He offered a potential future scenario where two business execs were negotiating a contract over Zoom. \nInstead of being on a call for a long time, they could send their digital twins to work together on the plan first, Yuan said. \nHe also spoke of how AI could assist with email, checking your messages for you, and help you figure out what was important and in need of a response. \nPlus, Yuan believes that AI could enhance Zoom’s broader suite of solutions, which includes things like an online whiteboard and collaborative docs.\n“Today, I need a manually focus on all those products to get work done. Eventually, AI will help,” Yuan said. \n“By doing that, we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?… Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That’s a goal,” he said. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nAuston Bunsen had a lot of free time after his company QuickNode reached a certain size. That company, a blockchain developer platform, was founded in 2017 and subsequently raised more than $100 million in funding, according to PitchBook.  \nThen Bunsen started thinking about the fact that people would perhaps like to unlock their doors with their iPhone. “I eventually met with some folks at Apple and they decided to make a bet that I could help further their goals to enable every company to bring the power of Apple Wallet to their door,” Bunsen told TechCrunch.  \nBunsen left QuickNode last October and decided to work on his new idea: AccessGrid, which builds APIs that companies can use to manage digital key fobs directly within Apple and Google’s wallet platforms. \n“It works when your iPhone is locked, syncs automatically to your watch, and, in the case of iPhone, works even if your phone is dead,” Bunsen said. The company officially launched in April, and on Tuesday, announced a $4.4 million seed round led by Harlem Capital.  \nRight now, Bunsen said, the access control industry is stuck in the late 1990s. Many systems must operate on-premises and are disconnected from the cloud, or use unencrypted communications and ID card technologies that are easily hackable.  \n“AccessGrid replaces that with an API that issues uncloneable credentials using encrypted payloads that can be instantly revoked via the cloud,” Bunsen said. “We think it’s time to bring physical security systems up to 2025 standards.”\nCybersecurity is a big concern for a product like this, but Bunsen says the company uses “military-grade” encryption as well as dual-encryption. “We use multi-factor authentication for all server access, and other standard cybersecurity practices,” he continued.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBunsen is building this product alone, unlike when he built QuickNode with three other co-founders, and described his fundraising journey as a “distraction.” \n“Serving customers is our purpose, so anything that is not that is a distraction for us,” he said.\nStill, Bunsen met Henri Pierre-Jacques, the managing partner at Harlem Capital, through some friends in Miami. Other investors in the round came from Bunsen’s time at QuickNode, such as Marell Evans from Exceptional Capital, and Maya Bakhai from Spice Capital. AccessGrid also took part in the HF0 accelerator and received its first check from the program.  \nAccessGrid is going up against other startups in this space, including SwiftConnect and Sharry. But Bunsen says his startup is different because it does not sell service contracts or middle-ware to talk to existing hardware devices. “We are a ‘pure play’, API-only,” Bunsen said, adding that it’s a developer platform, not an end-user app with API features.  \nThe fresh capital will be used to continue building the app’s security, as well as for new products and features. The company hopes to expand into automobile products soon.  \nEventually, Bunsen wants to upgrade every access control reader in the U.S. “Our hope is to create a world where everything you normally need a key for opens just because you’re nearby,” he said. “You’ll never lose your key because it’s always with you. We want to make getting into the places you belong faster, safer, and more seamless, for people and machines alike.”  \nThis piece was updated to reflect how much QuickNode had raised. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAstro Teller, CEO of X, Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” where the company incubates the nearly impossible, shared a look into what makes a moonshot and detailed the company’s “fail fast” mantra at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday.\nNotable companies that started out as moonshots from X’s moonshot factory include Waymo and Wing.\nTeller noted that X has a “2% hit rate,” which means that most of the things the company tries don’t work out, and that’s okay.\nHe said X defines a moonshot as having three specific components. The first is that it needs to attempt to solve a huge problem in the world. Second, there needs to be some kind of product or service that, however unlikely, would make the problem go away. Last, there has to be a sort of breakthrough technology that would provide a glimmer of hope at solving that huge, real-world problem.\n“If you worked at X, and you would just come up with a teleporter, you’ve got a moonshot story hypothesis, I would say, awesome, here’s a tiny amount of money, go see if you can prove that it’s wrong, because it probably is,” he said. “I don’t want you to make it work. I want you to get information about whether this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity or not, and it’s okay if the answer is no.”\nTeller went on to note that if someone is proposing a moonshot, and it sounds reasonable, the company isn’t interested, because that, by definition, wouldn’t be a moonshot. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea; that’s just not what X is looking for.\n“If you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components that I just described, and it’s a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,” Teller said. “If it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let’s put a bullet in its head and move on. And if it’s a little bit less crazy than we thought, awesome, here’s a tiny bit more money. Go try to find the next opportunity to kill it and repeat.”\nTeller emphasized that in order to do moonshots, you need to have equal amounts of audacity and humility.\n“If you don’t have really high audacity, you won’t start on these really unlikely journeys,” he said. “But, if you have anything less than really high humility, you’ll go luminously far down that unlikely journey.”\nX starts more than 100 things every year, and while 2% of them make it to exit five or six years later, 44% of all of the money that the company spends is on things that graduate and are “outrageously good,” Teller said. He says this is because X “kills all the bad ideas pretty early in the process.”\nTeller stated that people can learn innovation, noting that every single person was creative when they were children, but that we end up unlearning things that are useful, maybe even necessary for radical innovation. However, he says it’s possible to find these things again by creating an environment where you don’t feel stupid to go find them. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPaypal said on Tuesday that it is adopting a protocol in combination with OpenAI’s “Instant Checkout” feature to let users pay for their shopping directly within ChatGPT, starting in 2026.\nPaypal is adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open-source specification developed by OpenAI that lets merchants make their products available within AI apps, consequently enabling users to shop using AI agents. Meanwhile OpenAI’s “Instant Checkout” feature, launched in September, lets users confirm their order, shipping, and payment details, and complete purchases without leaving ChatGPT.\nCustomers can use their Paypal wallets for checkout, which, the company said, would enable it to provide buyer and seller protection, as well as dispute resolution. The company is also providing technology to handle card payments from within ChatGPT using a separate payments API.\nAnd next year, merchants using Paypal products will have their products be discoverable on ChatGPT, starting with categories like apparel, fashion, beauty, home improvement and electronics. Merchants will not need to build any integrations, as PayPal will handle merchant routing and payments behind the scenes.\nThe company said it is also launching an agentic commerce suite that would let merchants feature their catalogs within AI apps, accept payments on different AI apps, and get insights about consumer behavior.\nPayPal has been working to insert itself as a payments partner within various companies’ AI-enabled shopping experiences, particularly as people increasingly use AI apps to do their daily tasks. In May, the company teamed up with Perplexity to let users checkout within the AI search tool, and in September, Paypal said it was adopting Google’s Agent Payments Protocol to integrate its products within various Google products.\nPayPal said, apart from the partnership on commerce, the company is giving enterprise access to ChatGPT to all of its employees and allowing its engineers to make better use of OpenAI’s coding tools, Codex.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Hundreds of millions of people turn to ChatGPT each week for help with everyday tasks, including finding products they love, and over 400 million use PayPal to shop,” Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a statement. “By partnering with OpenAI and adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol, PayPal will power payments and commerce experiences that help people go from chat to checkout in just a few taps for our joint customer bases,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs as it seeks to reduce bureaucracy, remove layers and invest more in its AI strategy.\nThis marks the e-commerce giant’s second-largest job cuts since it slashed 22,000 jobs in 2022. Amazon had nearly 1.2 million employees as of October 31, 2024, of which more than 360,000 were in its corporate division, in administrative, sales and executive roles. \nIn a memo shared with employees, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote that the move is aimed at making the company “even stronger” by shifting resources to invest in its “biggest bets.”\nGaletti acknowledged that the decision would be questioned in light of the company’s good performance, but argued that the layoffs are necessary because the “world is changing quickly.”\n“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted [sic] that we need to be organized more leanly [sic], with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she wrote.\nThe layoffs come at a time when Amazon is investing heavily in tech infrastructure to build more compute capacity for offering AI services. \nIn June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to staff that the company would need fewer employees as it continues to roll out more AI agents. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat focus is clearly visible if you consider the company’s expenditure on tech infrastructure. Amazon said it had spent $55.6 billion in the first half of its current financial year primarily on tech infrastructure to support the growth of its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, according to its quarterly report. \nThe company’s revenue increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. AWS accounted for 18% of total net sales.\nReuters reported on Monday that the company was planning to slash up to 30,000 jobs across human resources, devices and services, operations, and other departments. \nThe company has made smaller job cuts across different divisions. In January, Amazon reduced a small number of positions in its Communications and Sustainability departments. \nAmazon said it is offering most affected employees 90 days to look for a new role internally, and its recruiters would prioritize internal candidates for new roles within the company. It will also offer severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more to those who can’t move internally.\nGaletti wrote that in 2026, the company would continue to remove layers and “realize efficiency gains” while hiring in key areas. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nAdobe today released new AI assistants Creative Cloud products, Express and Photoshop, that can help users with image creation and editing.\nMost companies like to put AI assistants into a sidebar in their products to grab on-screen context. But for Express, Adobe has created a new mode that lets you use text prompts to create new images and designs. You can switch on the assistant mode to use AI prompts and then switch back to use editing tools and controls that are available in Express in the current version.\nMeanwhile, the new Photoshop assistant, which is in closed beta testing, lives in the sidebar. Adobe claims the assistant can understand different layers and help you automatically select objects and create masks. Adobe added that users can ask the assistant to complete repetitive tasks such as removing backgrounds or changing colors.\nImage credits: Adobe\nAdobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, told TechCrunch that the company decided to build a different mode for its AI assistant in Express to target students and professionals who use the app. The company wants to see if users can achieve what they want to do without having to switch back to the traditional interface, he explained.\n“We think this approach of switching between two modes, where you get the best of both worlds, is gonna make the technology both accessible and controllable,” Costin said.\nThe company said it is also experimenting with a new type of assistant, dubbed “Project Moonlight,” that can coordinate with different assistants from other Adobe tools, and connect to a creator’s social channels to better understand their style. Adobe said the product is in the early stages of development and is in private beta.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nThe company said it is also exploring a way to connect Adobe Express with ChatGPT using OpenAI’s app integrations API to let users create designs directly in ChatGPT.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdobe also announced a new set of AI features for its Creative Cloud apps.

    "body": "\nOpenAI is offering its ChatGPT Go plan available free of charge for one year to users in India who sign up during a limited promotional period starting November 4, as the company looks to expand in one of its top markets.\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI announced the promotion but did not specify how long the offer would remain available. Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers in India will also be eligible for the free 12-month plan, the company said.\nPriced at less than $5 per month, ChatGPT Go launched in India in August as OpenAI’s most affordable paid subscription plan. The service later expanded to Indonesia and, earlier this month, to 16 additional countries across Asia.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country with over 700 million smartphone users and more than a billion internet subscribers, has been a key market for OpenAI. The company opened its New Delhi office in August and is currently building a local team to expand its presence.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said India was the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. However, making money from ChatGPT’s paid plans in the country has proven challenging. The app saw over 29 million downloads in the 90 days leading up to August, but generated just $3.6 million in in-app purchases during that period, according to Appfigures data reviewed by TechCrunch at the time.\nChatGPT Go offers 10 times more usage than the free version for generating responses, creating images, and uploading files. It also features improved memory for more personalized responses, according to OpenAI.\n“Since initially launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we’ve seen from our users has been inspiring,” said Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, in a statement. “We’re excited to see the amazing things our users will build, learn, and achieve with these tools.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpenAI’s rivals, including Perplexity and Google, are also looking to tap into India’s large and youthful user base. Perplexity recently partnered with Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to the telecom operator’s 360 million subscribers. Similarly, Google introduced a free one-year AI Pro plan for students in India.\nOpenAI is set to host its DevDay Exchange developer conference Bengaluru on November 4, where it is expected to make India-specific announcements aimed at local developers and enterprises. India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing markets for ChatGPT, with millions of users engaging with the chatbot daily, the company said.\n\nExcited for our first DevDay Exchange event in India 🇮🇳 on November 4.

    "body": "\nOpenAI on Tuesday said it had completed its recapitalization, splitting the AI lab into a for-profit corporation nested inside a non-profit foundation. It’s the end result of a complex legal process that had been strenuously resisted by its estranged co-founder, Elon Musk.\nUnder the new structure, the non-profit OpenAI Foundation will have legal control over a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group, which is free to raise funding or acquire companies without legal restraint. The Foundation will hold a significant stake in OpenAI Group, and will appoint its board of directors. \n“We believe that the world’s most powerful technology must be developed in a way that reflects the world’s collective interests,” OpenAI chairman Brett Taylor wrote in a blog post. “The close of our recapitalization gives us the ability to keep pushing the frontier of AI, and an updated corporate structure to ensure progress serves everyone.”\nUnder the new structure, the OpenAI Foundation will own 26% of the for-profit, with a warrant for additional shares to be granted if the company continues to grow. Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, will hold a roughly 27% stake, valued at about $135 billion, with the remaining 47% held by investors and employees.\nAccording to a separate blog post by Microsoft, the deal will also extend Microsoft’s IP rights to OpenAI models through 2032. If OpenAI ever declares that it has achieved its long-held goal of artificial general intelligence, the deal will also require it to submit to an independent expert panel for verification.\nPrior to this recapitalization, OpenAI was operating as a non-profit under strict equity restrictions — a position that became increasingly untenable as the company’s fundraising became more ambitious. In April, Softbank announced an unprecedented $30 billion investment into OpenAI, contingent on the company’s successful conversion into a for-profit. On Saturday, The Information reported that the final installment of the funding had been sent, signaling a possible breakthrough in the restructuring.\nThere have been a number of legal efforts to block or otherwise influence the restructuring, most notably from Elon Musk, who at one point offered to acquire the company for $97.4 billion. State attorneys general from California and Delaware also made inquiries into the process, and Taylor cited them specifically as a positive influence on the discussions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We made several changes as a result of those discussions and we believe OpenAI—and as a result, the public we serve—are better for them,” Taylor wrote.\nIn the wake of the news, CEO Sam Altman announced an open livestream with chief scientist Jakub Pachocki to answer questions from the public.

    "body": "\nRobots can be programmed to do a variety of tasks, like packing boxes and even performing surgery. But each individual movement or task requires its own specific training process, which makes it hard for robots to adapt in real-world scenarios.\nMbodi wants to make training robots easier and quicker with the help of AI agents. The company will be showcasing this tech as one of the Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalists at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nNew York-based Mbodi built a cloud-to-edge system, a hybrid computing system using both cloud and local compute, that is designed to integrate into existing robotic tech stacks. The software relies on a multitude of AI agents that communicate with each other to gather the needed information to help a robot learn a task faster.\nOnce deployed, Mbodi will collect data and learn from its real-world use cases.\nXavier Chi, co-founder of Mbodi, told TechCrunch that users prompt the software using natural language, and Mbodi breaks down the request into smaller subtasks. Mbodi’s cluster of agents essentially divides and conquers the task to gather the needed information to train the robot on the prompt quickly.\n“The tricky thing with the physical world, it’s infinite possibility,” Chi said. “Every time you can invent something completely new, you haven’t had any data, that is a problem in the physical world. We always need to have a system where you can orchestrate different models or have anyone correct a robot and tell it to do certain things certain ways.”\nChi said he and co-founder Sebastian Peralta got the idea for the company while working as engineers at Google. While they weren’t working on robotics, they both came to the realization that the advancements in AI were heading to the physical world and despite a rise in physical AI, there still wasn’t a great way to quickly train robots.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany companies, like Skild AI and FieldAI, are looking to help make training robots faster by building large world AI models with enough real-world data to make it easier for them to adapt to new environments. Chi said that philosophy just doesn’t work with how much the world constantly changes.\nMbodi launched in 2024 with a focus on picking and packaging. The company won an ABB Robotics AI startup competition last year, which landed them a partnership with the Swiss robotics organization that was acquired by SoftBank for $5.4 billion in October.\nNow the company is working with a Fortune 100 company in the consumer and product goods space on a proof of concept.\n“For the CPG customer, they have a lot of people, they pack different products of their brand into a tray or a shelf thing, the problem is it changes every day,” Chi said. “Because of that, it is impossible to put robots there. To reprogram these robots, it’s just not possible, there is still a lot of humans doing that work.”\nMbodi hopes to start deploying its software more in 2026.\n“We want to build something that works, that can actually be deployed,” Chi said. “We aren’t a research lab; we don’t want to be a research lab in that regard. We want to put something in production that works reliably.”\nIf you want to hear from Mbodi firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect Chi’s title. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "description": "Strong by Form has designed a structural floor piece that can span longer distances than existing engineered wood, making it a replacement for steel or concrete. At the same time, the product is lighter than all three.",
    "body": "\nEven before a building accepts its first occupant, it has racked up a steep carbon debt. Worldwide, the materials and construction required to erect buildings contributes 11% of global carbon emissions, according to the World Green Building Council.\nSome places have begun experimenting with multistory timber buildings, and while they’ve recently reached new heights, timber buildings won’t be replacing skyscrapers anytime soon. But one Chilean startup thinks that there’s still room for wood to find a place.\n“We’re more into hybrid buildings,” Andrés Mitnik, co-founder and CEO of Strong by Form, told TechCrunch. His company has developed a new engineered wood product that can replace concrete and steel in structural floors, allowing architects to design lighter, less carbon intensive buildings. The company is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist and is presenting at TechCrunch Disrupt, which runs this week in San Francisco. \nThe secret is in how those floor plates are made. “We think we can shape wood in a way that no one else has done it before,” he said.\nStrong by Form has designed a structural floor piece that can span longer distances than existing engineered wood, making it a replacement for steel or concrete. At the same time, the product is lighter than all three.\nOn the outside, builders will see something familiar. “When a contractor gets it, they see a CLT [cross-laminated timber] slab,” Mitnik said. “All the connections, the construction system, all the processes on site are exactly as if you were using CLT, so no need to learn new things.”\nBut inside, instead of more solid wood, like you’d find in a CLT, the structure is filled with cavities. Wood shavings have been pressed into a wavy board that’s optimized to bear heavy loads.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe wavy panel looks like oriented strand board, or OSB, which is common throughout job sites. But Strong by Form has developed software and a manufacturing technique to tweak the size and alignment of the wood flakes that are held together by a glue-like binder. “It’s sort of a next-generation OSB, if you want to think about it like that,” Mitnik said.\nBy using wood’s natural form and strengths, Strong by Form has built wood structural floors that currently span 10 meters (about 33 feet). Most CLT floors can only span half that distance.\nAll that technology isn’t free, but Mitnik said that the higher costs of its engineered wood product can be offset by its lighter weight. \n“The idea is to create something that is so light it allows you to have an overall optimization of the structure,” he said. Lighter floors mean less steel and concrete in the frame, which lowers the overall cost of the building. “With those additional savings, we’re able to achieve price parity with concrete.”\nStrong by Form is testing its 10-meter panel, ensuring it meets fire and load ratings that structural engineers require.\nNext, it will raise a Series A round targeted at $10 million to build a pilot plant to produce the first pieces intended for commercial deployment.\nIn the meantime, Strong by Form has also developed a panel three millimeters thick that’s intended for finish instead of structural duty. The startup is working with train manufacturers to use its subtly undulating panel on the interior of trains, where they can soften the aesthetic of the walls and ceilings of train cars while reducing their mass.\n“That has allowed us to fund all the R&D [research and development] required to do the floors, which is what we really want to scale, because that’s where the impact is,” Mitnik said.\nIf you want to learn more about Strong by Form from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, this week in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nAdobe said on Tuesday that it is launching the latest iteration of its image generation model, Firefly Image 5. The company is also adding more features to the Firefly website, support for more third-party models, the ability to generate speech and soundtracks. Notably, the update allows artists to come up with their own image models using their existing art.\nImage 5 model can now work at native resolutions of up to 4 megapixels, a massive increase from the previous gen model, which could natively generate images at 1 megapixels but then would upscale them to 4 megapixels. The new model is also better at rendering humans, the company said.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nImage 5 also enables layered and prompt-based editing — the model treats different objects as layers and allows you to edit them using prompts, or use tools like resize and rotate. The company said it makes sure that when you edit these layers, the image’s details and integrity are not compromised.\nAdobe’s Firefly site has supported third-party models from AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Runway, Topaz, and Flu to augment its appeal to its creative customer base, and now the company is taking that a step further by letting users  create custom models based on their art style. Currently in a closed beta, this feature lets users drag and drop assets, such as images, illustrations and sketches, to create a custom image model based on their style.\nThe company is also adding some new features to its Firefly website, which was redesigned earlier this year. The site now lets you use the prompt box to switch between generating images or videos, choose which AI model you want to work with, change aspect ratios, and more. The site’s home page now features your files and recent generation history, and you also get shortcuts to other Adobe apps (these were previously housed in a menu).\nAdobe has also redesigned the video generation and editing tool to support layers and timeline-based editing. This design change is currently only available in a private beta, and will be rolled out to users eventually.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nFirefly is also getting two new audio features: Users can now employ AI prompts to generate entire soundtracks and speech — using models from ElevenLabs — for videos. There’s also a new way to easily come up with prompts: just add keywords and sections by selecting words from a word cloud.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage credits: Adobe\nAs its competitors like Canva add AI to their platforms, Adobe is trying to cater to new-age creators who are increasingly using AI in their workflows. “We’re thinking of the target audience for Firefly as what we call creators or next-generation creative professionals. I think there are these emergent creatives that are GenAI-oriented. They love to use GenAI in all their workloads,” Alexandru Costin, the company’s VP of generative AI, told TechCrunch over a call.\nHe added that with Firefly, the company now has more freedom to add new features and play around with the interface as it doesn’t have to adhere to the muscle memory of creative professionals who might be used to certain workflows in Adobe’s existing Creative Cloud tools.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDuring an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 on Monday, Sequoia Capital managing partner Roelof Botha answered questions about his colleague, Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire, and controversial comments Maguire made earlier this year, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”\nIn a July 4 post on X, Maguire attacked New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling the politician an “Islamist” who “comes from a culture that lies about everything.” His remarks led to a sizable online backlash and debate about the reputational risk to the VC firm that has backed companies like Airbnb, Google, Nvidia, and Stripe.\nShortly after the event, over a thousand founders and tech industry professionals signed an open letter urging Sequoia to take action and make it clear that “silence in the face of hate has consequences.” An open letter later surfaced supporting Maguire.\nLast week, the Financial Times reported that Sequoia’s chief operating officer Sumaiya Balbale, a practicing Muslim, quit over the firm’s decision not to discipline Maguire following his remarks.\nOn stage, Botha declined to comment on the COO’s departure, saying as a matter of routine, Sequoia doesn’t comment on personnel matters and that he appreciated everything Balbale had contributed to the firm.\nHowever, when it came to a question about whether Sequoia has previously seen its partners express their political positions as publicly as their views on business, Botha argued that Sequoia has always supported a diversity of views. Botha noted that, for example, Sequoia VC Michael Moritz had been outspoken in his opposition to President Trump, while former managing partner Doug Leone was a vocal Trump supporter.\n“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha, referring to Maguire, told TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos onstage.\nThe response was surprisingly candid, given the high-profile nature of the remarks and the potential to dissuade some founders from working with Sequoia.\n“We actually have a tremendous breadth of opinion within our partnership, and we celebrate that some people just choose to express it differently,” Botha continued. \n“We have some of our partners that are very active in philanthropy or some of the private dealings, and they’re just not as vocal as Shaun might be on social media. And we’ve always honored the right to free speech of each of our individual partners,” said Botha.\nBotha argued, too, that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to a certain set of founders. Maguire, for instance, has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI. Botha said he’s also attracting founders in one of the other currently hot industries besides AI these days: defense tech. For instance, he’s backed autonomous weapons rising star Mach Industries.\n“He’s a physics PhD who dropped out of high school,” Botha said, noting that Maguire was “very technical.” \nBotha did, however, admit that Maguire’s brand of outspokenness isn’t completely free from consequences. “So, does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb.

    "body": "\nPytho AI is coming out of stealth with an ambitious pitch to the Department of Defense: turn mission planning that takes warfighters days into a process measured in minutes.\nThe startup was founded by Michael Mearn, a former Marine human-intelligence officer whose teams located insurgents, IEDs, weapons, and other intel. The idea for the company came from watching planners spend days building mission plans for a single operation, he told TechCrunch. Pytho AI is a Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nAs he explains it, war plans aren’t just for large-scale conflicts, what one might think of as “war games.” Instead, everyday service members execute plans for everything from disaster preparation to flight missions.\nMearn saw the status quo firsthand. In Afghanistan, his team built plans the same way much of the military still does today: by assembling maps, diagrams, tables, and text in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, then sending them up the chain for review.\n “It’s too slow for how fast the battlefield now moves,” he said. There can be more than 150 products and artifacts created during the planning process, and a team of five could spend roughly 12,000 minutes of labor over five days on one plan — of which, 70% goes into data management rather than strategy.\nEven worse, plans go stale quickly, and time and resource constraints often mean missions aren’t updated or compared against alternatives.\nMearn used a conflict in the Indo-Pacific as an example. “There is a plan that exists that we’re supposed to be constantly updating based off new information and ready to enact at any time. That should be dynamic. Is it in reality?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAfter leaving the Marines, Mearn went to Harvard Business School before going to Silicon Valley, where he worked on Facebook’s misinformation team during the 2018 midterms. He later led product at a handful of startups. He and CTO Shah Hossain founded Pytho in the summer of 2023 after talking with people still serving in the military and hearing that mission planning remained a major pain point.\nThe startup is only four people, split between Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. But its ambitions are to change mission planning for every service member in the armed forces through a streamlined software product. Rather than a chatbot interface, it uses a template structure that’s well understood by service members today, powered by a system of AI agents to generate plans in any format.\nThe company’s first demo centers on mission analysis, a process with 48 steps that are generally time-intensive but now take mere minutes to complete.\nHumans stay in the loop, and after generating the draft, Pytho’s software invites planners to edit where needed. The company included features like confidence scores to contextualize the information, and the software can integrate with Microsoft products to align with existing workflows.\nMearn emphasized that they are building the product to ensure a range of end users can access it, whether that be 18-year-old specialists fresh out of high school to two-star generals with decades of service behind them.\nOf course, breaking into the Department of Defense is notoriously challenging. Pytho claims it already has work with “almost every single service” by embedding company engineers with units to co-build planning workflows.\n“Service members out there need people that are dedicated solely to building these plans,” he said. “It would almost be a disservice to not have a company dedicated to this.”\nIf you want to learn from Pytho AI firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, this week in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

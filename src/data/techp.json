With this expansion, the feature is now available in countries like Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.\nUsers who have set one of these languages as their default, instead of English, can now chat with the AI in question-and-answer format. Reddit uses a Google AI model to power the feature.\nReddit first debuted AI-powered search last year and has been working to expand it in different ways. The feature is part of Reddit Answers, which lives alongside the platform’s traditional search.\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman said in August that Reddit search has more than 70 million weekly users, while Reddit Answers is used by more than 6 million people. He also discussed plans to unify the search experience during the company’s quarterly earnings call. \nQ&A-style search and chat interfaces have been gaining popularity since ChatGPT integrated web search. Incumbent search engines like Google and Brave have introduced similar features to improve user engagement and retention. Newer startups like Perplexity have also gained steam with chat-based search interfaces.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

    "body": "\nThe sprawling metropolis of Phoenix continues to be a testbed for Waymo, and not just on the technical front. The Alphabet-owned company has used its first testing and commercial market to experiment with its business model, too, including delivery.\nWaymo is known for its robotaxis, but it has tested how its tech could be used for delivery. The company previously tapped UPS and Uber Eats for pilot programs, and it put considerable staff and resources toward developing self-driving trucks under its Waymo Via arm, before shuttering that program in 2023 to focus on robotaxis.\nNow it seems Waymo is ready to test the delivery waters through a strategic, multi-year partnership with DoorDash. Waymo doesn’t have any other active delivery-focused testing, operations, or partnerships, according to a company spokesperson.\nThe partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, the company wrote in a blog post.\nNot every DoorDash order will result in a Waymo delivery. Initially, the Waymo delivery service will deliver orders from DashMart — DoorDash’s convenience, grocery, and retail stores. The companies said that, over time, more local Phoenix merchants and a wider variety of offerings will be added.\nDavid Richter, vice president of business and corporate development at DoorDash, said the deal with Waymo will give customers a “new and delightful experience, while advancing our vision for a multi-modal autonomousfuture of local commerce.”\nDoorDash isn’t new to the autonomous vehicle technology arena. The company has partnered with sidewalk delivery bot company Serve Robotics to cover parts of Los Angeles. It also has its own in-house autonomous vehicle tech team that developed and produced an autonomous delivery bot called Dot. The delivery bot, which was revealed in September, is being tested in the Phoenix area.\nThe deal with Waymo won’t involve DoorDash’s Dot vehicle, however. Instead, food or groceries will be placed in the trunk of a Waymo vehicle — a driverless Jaguar I-Pace that will navigate on its own to the customer. From here, the customer will have to retrieve the items from the trunk via the DoorDash app. \nThis last step, which requires the customer to walk out to the car and grab the delivered items, will be the big test for both companies, as they try to determine whether the novelty of receiving groceries delivered by an autonomous vehicle outweighs the convenience of a human handing over the items at their door. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nWhatsApp is attempting to solve its spam problem by putting a curb on how many messages individual users and businesses can send to unknown people without getting a response.\nWhile the app started as an easy way to send messages to personal contacts, over time, it has become more complex with groups, communities, and business messaging. With those changes, people are getting more messages than ever, and it is hard to catch up with all of them.\nAll messages users and businesses send to others will count against this new per-month limit, unless they get a response. For instance, if you meet someone at a conference and send three messages, that counts against the limit.\nWhatsApp hasn’t said what the limit will be, as it’s testing different limits during this time.  \nHowever, when a business or an individual is about to hit the limit, the app will display a warning to those users with a pop-up showing the count, so they can avoid getting blocked from sending messages.\nThe company told TechCrunch that this test will be live in multiple countries in the coming weeks. It also said that average users won’t usually hit the limit, and their messaging experience won’t be affected. Instead, the controls are designed to be effective against people and businesses that blast messages and spam people.\nPersonally, when I look at my WhatsApp inbox, I often find over 50 unread messages. When I try to see who sent them, a number of them are from businesses and unknown people. People around me have had similar experiences as WhatsApp acts as a multi-use communication tool for a market like India, where I’m based. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOver the last year, WhatsApp has tried to curb some of this spammy behaviour through tools and guardrails. In July 2024, the company started testing limits on how many marketing messages a business can send to people in a month. In 2024, it started floating an option for users to unsubscribe from marketing messages from businesses. This way, they can receive updates or get support from a business without getting spammed. \nEarlier this year, WhatsApp started experimenting by putting a limit on the number of broadcast messages users and businesses can send to others. The company said that it has started expanding this experiment in more than a dozen countries, including India, one of the company’s biggest markets with over 500 million users.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAustin Russell, the billionaire founder of Luminar, has made a bid to acquire the lidar-maker five months after he was replaced as CEO following an ethics inquiry.\nThe takeover effort was disclosed in an SEC filing by Russell early Friday morning. It would involve his new company, Russell AI Labs, purchasing 100% of the outstanding shares of Luminar’s Class A Common Stock for an undisclosed price. \nIf it happens, Luminar would remain publicly traded, and Russell AI Labs may “acquire a different, larger global automotive technology company” and merge it with Luminar “to create a unified technology platform business (‘Luminar 2.0’),” according to the filing. If that happens, Russell himself may also invest in the newly combined company.\nThe proposal was made on October 14, “at the suggestion of certain shareholders” of Luminar and “the invitation of certain members of the board” — though the filing does not name names. Luminar and Russell AI Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe proposed acquisition is just as sudden and surprising as Russell’s replacement in May. Luminar announced Russell’s resignation on May 19, the same day that the company reported its first-quarter earnings. The company tapped former Xerox executive Paul Ricci to take over.\nThe company offered no details about why Russell was out aside from saying the board’s audit committee had conducted a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry.” Luminar has yet to explain what that inquiry found. It has been sued by shareholders multiple times over the move and the way it was disclosed.\nThat said, Russell is no stranger to takeover attempts. In 2023, he launched a bid to buy Forbes. But that ultimately failed after some of the investors in the acquisition reportedly didn’t follow through. The bid process was also marred by an alleged connection to a Russian oligarch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRussell has remained on Luminar’s board and was supposed to be “available to the incoming Chief Executive Officer on transition and technology matters,” according to the release. But he’s been absent in at least one way, by failing to have signed (in his capacity as a board member) any of the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission since being replaced.\nIn the meantime, Russell co-founded Russell AI Labs in September along with Markus Schäfer, CTO and board member of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Murtaza Ahmed, a former partner at the SoftBank Vision Fund. The new company claims it “backs and builds transformative AI and frontier technology companies” and has already taken a $300 million stake in agentic AI company Emergence. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nApple announced on Friday that it has secured exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights to Formula 1. The new five-year agreement between the tech giant and Formula 1 will make Apple TV the exclusive streaming home for all Formula 1 races starting in the 2026 season, taking over from current broadcaster ESPN.\nAll practice, qualifying, Sprint sessions, and Grands Prix will be available to Apple TV subscribers. Select races and all practice sessions will also be available for free in the Apple TV app throughout the season, Apple says.\nApple reportedly bid $140-$150 million annually for the rights, which is significantly more than the $85 million annually that ESPN currently pays for Formula 1. Apple’s deal is valued at about $750 million over the five-year term.  \nThe move comes a few days after Apple rebranded its streaming service from “Apple TV+” to just “Apple TV,” ditching the plus sign. \nIt also follows Apple’s partnership with Formula 1 for the original film “F1 The Movie” starring Brad Pitt, which grossed $629 million worldwide this year, making it the highest-grossing sports movie of all time. The film is set to debut on Apple TV on December 12.\nIn addition to broadcasting Formula 1, Apple says it will amplify the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+. Plus, the Apple Sports app will feature live updates for every qualifying, Sprint, and race for each Grand Prix across the season, with real-time leaderboards, season driver and constructor standings, Live Activities to follow on the Lock Screen, and a Home Screen widget.\n“We’re thrilled to expand our relationship with Formula 1 and offer Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. front-row access to one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports on the planet,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a press release. “2026 marks a transformative new era for Formula 1, from new teams to new regulations and cars with the best drivers in the world, and we look forward to delivering premium and innovative fan-first coverage to our customers in a way that only Apple can.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFormula 1 is the latest sport to join Apple TV’s lineup, alongside Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball. \nApple notes that Formula 1 is one of the fastest-growing leagues in the world, with a U.S. fanbase that reached 52 million in 2024. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The U.S. government is, according to these allegations, looking for posts that express views that the current government disfavors.\nThe lawsuit states that the list of forbidden posts include those that criticize the American culture and the U.S. government; that express antisemitic/pro-Palestine support, including support of university protests on the matter; those that rationalize or make light of Charlie Kirk’s murder; or that criticize the Trump administration or its actions.\nThe EFF also alleges that the government is threatening non-citizens with punishments, which includes revoking their visas to immigration confinement.\nThe lawsuit points to posts on the State Department’s X account. This includes the currently pinned thread documenting the visas that the department revoked over comments about Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.

    "body": "\nIn Evelyn Mora’s early career, she realized that fashion designers, although often deeply focused on sustainability, couldn’t stage environmentally friendly large-scale fashion shows.  \nIn 2021, she launched VLGE, a gaming and immersive-world-building platform that specializes in working with brands. It lets brands build their own worlds, fill them with interactive content and games, and export said worlds to other platforms like Roblox. The product is revolutionizing what shopping could be in the future — a world where brands can create interactive worlds to connect with Gen Z rather than hosting fashion shows and filming campaigns. \nVLGE has worked with names such as Lancome, Charlotte Tilbury, and Vogue Scandinavia, and has raised a total of $5 million in capital from investors such as Lammont J. du Pont of the du Pont family, L’Oreal Group, and the British Fashion Council.\nIt made headlines for launching the world’s first 3D and gamified fashion week. On Thursday, it announced plans to take things one step further. It said 50 fashion brands would launch their shoppable worlds for World Fashion Week, all powered by VLGE. World Fashion Week is an initiative of VLGE and is supposed to act as a bridge for creators to launch shoppable games on other platforms, like Roblox. \nImage Credits:Lucie Baudi\nMora said this is the brand’s first large-scale activation, showing how the platform can let users build across browsers and, first, on Roblox, in real time. She decided to focus on making Roblox easier for brands to use because of the market potential, she said. VLGE is also compatible with Unreal Engine and is working on compatibility with Meta Horizon World.\n“This is significant because Roblox has become fashion’s most powerful youth frontier, yet until now, world-building there has been costly, technical, and complex,” Mora told TechCrunch. “We make it instant, affordable, scalable, and interoperable, bridging the gap between e-commerce, gaming, and cultural creation.” \nIn other words, anyone building on VLGE can launch on Roblox instantly, without needing to know Roblox’s coding language or having any substantive background in tech at all. “They also don’t need to pay tens of thousands and wait for months to launch.” (It can cost anywhere between $10,000 to $100,000 for a brand to pay an agency to build it a world on Roblox.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVLGE offers four payment tiers: Freemium, and three paid tiers for creators, small businesses, and enterprises, respectively. \nMora is banking on gamified commerce becoming the next frontier in fashion and said VLGE plans to launch an online store, an e-tail store, that will sell both physical items by emerging brands, as well as 3D assets that can be exported into Roblox. The technology showcases how the fashion world is trying to make use of the increasing prominence of games and immersive worlds when it comes to connecting with the next generation. \n“This moment isn’t just about fashion, it’s about the infrastructure that will power the next generation of commerce for the new generation,” Mora said. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSouth Korean telco giant SK Telecom is making big changes at its new AI division, AI CIC, just weeks after it was launched. Staff employed by the unit are being offered a voluntary retirement program as part of a broader effort to bring together the company’s various AI-related divisions, SK Telecom confirmed to TechCrunch. \n“In late September, SK Telecom announced the launch of the AI CIC (Company-in-Company) unit and confirmed that detailed organizational restructuring would be specified by the end of October,” a spokesperson at SK Telecom told TechCrunch. “This special retirement program is entirely a supportive measure and is not intended as a restructuring or downsizing measure.”\nThe voluntary retirement program will not involve forced layoffs, and is meant to support employees whose roles, organizations or work locations may change, the spokesperson said. Employees who opt to stay with the company may be reassigned to regional offices.\nDetails of the voluntary retirement program have been communicated to staff across all experience levels, including both junior and senior employees, industry sources told TechCrunch. The AI unit has about 1,000 employees, per media reports.\nAI CIC is meant to bring together SK Telecom’s various AI-related units under a centralized organization, per the spokesperson. “This integration involves streamlining overlapping roles and functions, which may inevitably lead to changes such as role transitions, organizational realignments, or relocations,” they said.\nThe new division will oversee the development of SK Telecom’s personal AI agent, A. (pronounced “A-dot”), its AI data center operations, enterprise AI business, as well as global AI partnerships and investments.\nSeverance packages are reportedly expected to vary based on employees’ tenure and position, but the spokesperson told TechCrunch the company has set no such internal targets. “As participation is entirely voluntary, it is difficult at this stage to predict [how many employees] it may impact on the organization as a whole,” the spokesperson said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe restructuring comes as SK Telecom seeks to streamline operations and boost efficiency, with a specific focus on AI. The company plans for the AI division to record annual revenue of ₩5 trillion (around $3.5 billion) by 2030, and expects AI-driven B2C and B2B services as well as related infrastructure to drive that growth.\nThe telecom giant recently unveiled an AI infrastructure effort, offering Nvidia Blackwell GPUs-as-a-service, and earlier this month partnered with OpenAI to develop AI data centers in southwestern Korea as part of the ‘Stargate Korea’ initiative. \n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nTravel search engine Kayak will now allow users to research trips ahead of booking using AI. The company this week launched an “AI Mode” feature that lets users ask travel-related questions as well as compare and book flights, hotels, and cars, through an AI chatbot integrated on the company’s website.\nThe feature is currently available across both desktop and mobile web, and takes advantage of Kayak’s integration with ChatGPT to deliver contextual results. \nThe rollout follows the company’s April launch of Kayak.ai, built as a testing ground for working with AI technology. That site also combined Kayak’s data and tools with OpenAI’s technology, letting its tech team try out AI features ahead of bringing them over to Kayak.com\nEssentially, the AI Mode feature offers the same functionality as the Kayak.ai website but is now built directly into Kayak’s website. The company suggests users could ask the chatbot for travel ideas, like locations to fly to for under a certain price point, the best deals to a preferred destination, comparing hotel amenities, finding nonstop flights and rental car options, and more.\nImage Credits:Kayak\nPlus, users can ask the AI more open-ended questions, like “I want to party for NYE — where should I go?” to get recommendations without having specific destinations in mind. Or they could learn when the best time to fly somewhere would be, based on ticket prices. (Kayak has shared other AI prompt ideas on its own blog.)\nThe feature could be useful in helping consumers in the earlier stages of travel planning, when they’re just exploring ideas. However, it remains to be seen if AI users readily convert to paying customers using these methods. \nAI Mode is initially available in English in the United States but will expand to other countries and languages later in the month. The company also plans to roll out the feature to more platforms and add support for voice-based requests “soon.”\nImage Credits:Kayak\nTravel is an area that’s being explored by AI providers and travel companies alike, as online booking can be a frustrating and tedious experience for consumers as it stands today. To test consumer demand for AI solutions, OpenAI recently announced deals with travel companies like Expedia and Booking.com (the latter is also owned by Kayak’s parent company, Booking Holdings). As a result, those services can now operate as apps inside ChatGPT.\nBy comparison, Kayak’s decision to run the AI chatbot on its own site could provide the company with more direct access to consumer insights about the AI’s use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The features, which will be rolled out next year, include the ability to block certain characters and monitor conversation topics.\nStarting in the coming months, parents will be able to turn off chats with AI characters entirely for teens. This action won’t block access to the Meta AI chatbot — the company’s general-purpose AI chatbot — which will only discuss age-appropriate content.\nParents will also be able to turn off chats with individual characters if they prefer more selective control. Plus, they will receive information about the topics teens are discussing with AI characters and Meta AI.\nThe company said it plans to roll out these controls on Instagram early next year. They will be available in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia.\n“We recognize parents already have a lot on their plates when it comes to navigating the internet safely with their teens, and we’re committed to providing them with helpful tools and resources that make things simpler for them, especially as they think about new technology like AI,” the company said in a post written by Instagram head Adam Mosseri and newly appointed Meta AI head Alexandr Wang.\nEarlier this week, Meta said that its content and AI experiences for teens will follow a PG-13 movie rating standard and will avoid sensitive topics such as extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.\nThe company added that currently, teens are only allowed to interact with a limited number of characters that follow age-appropriate content guidelines. Parents can also set time limits on teens’ interactions with AI characters. Earlier this year, Instagram announced that it is using AI to identify attempting to skirt age limits by faking their age on the app.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the past few weeks, multiple platforms, including OpenAI, Meta, and YouTube, have released tools and controls focused on teen safety.

Ultimately, a bankruptcy administrator put the company’s assets through a competitive bid process. \nNow some of its tech will live on over at Archer Aviation, which beat out Ambitious Air Mobility Group and U.S.-based Joby Aviation with the winning bid of €18 million ($21 million) for all 300 of Lilium’s patent assets. Joby confirmed it participated in the bid.\nLilium, which was founded in 2015, was developing a vertical take-off and landing aircraft with speeds of up to 100 km/h. The company raised more than $1 billion from investors before going public in 2021 on the Nasdaq via a merger with Qell, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). While it managed to land high-profile investors like Tencent and lock in customers, including an order for 100 electric jets from Saudi Arabia, it burned through cash long before it could deliver a product.\nThe patents span critical eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) technologies, including high-voltage systems, flight controls, ducted fans, and advanced aircraft design, according to an Archer spokesperson. The new patents represent a “strong addition” to Archer’s growing IP portfolio, which now totals more than 1,000 global patent assets, the spokesperson noted in an email.\nWhat Archer plans to do with those patents isn’t totally clear, although there are hints. Lilium’s electric ducted fans would be a good application for light-sport or regional electric flight — which goes beyond Archer’s original mission.\nArcher, which went public in 2021 via a merger with a SPAC, initially focused on developing an air taxi network. It added a defense program in December, which included an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered VTOL aircraft for critical defense applications. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nOpenAI announced Thursday it paused the ability for users to generate videos resembling the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. using its AI video model, Sora. The company says it’s adding this safeguard at the request of Dr. King’s estate after some Sora users generated “disrespectful depictions” of his image.\n“While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” OpenAI said in a post on X from its official newsroom account. “Authorized representatives or estate owners can request that their likeness not be used in Sora cameos.”\n\nStatement from OpenAI and King Estate, Inc.The Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. (King, Inc.) and OpenAI have worked together to address how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s likeness is represented in Sora generations. Some users generated disrespectful depictions of Dr.…— OpenAI Newsroom (@OpenAINewsroom) October 17, 2025\n\nThe restriction comes just a few weeks after OpenAI launched its social video platform, Sora, which allows users to create realistic AI-generated videos resembling historical figures, their friends, and users who elect to have their likeness recreated on the platform. The launch has stirred fervent public debate around the dangers of AI-generated videos, and how platforms should implement guardrails around the technology.\nDr. Bernice King, Dr. King’s daughter, posted on Instagram last week asking people to stop sending her AI videos resembling her father. She joined Robin Williams’ daughter, who also asked Sora users to stop generating AI videos of her father.\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this week that Sora users had created AI-generated videos of Dr. King making monkey noises and wrestling with another civil rights icon, Malcolm X. Scrolling through OpenAI’s Sora app, it’s easy to find crude videos resembling other historical figures, including artist Bob Ross, singer Whitney Houston, and former President John F. Kennedy.\nThe licensor of Dr. King’s estate did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nBeyond how Sora represents humans, the launch has also raised a flurry of questions around how social media platforms should handle AI videos of copyrighted works. The Sora app is also full of videos depicting cartoons like SpongeBob, South Park, and Pokémon.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpenAI has added other restrictions to Sora in weeks since its launch. Earlier in October, the company said it planned to give copyright holders more granular control over the types of AI videos that can be generated with their likeness. That may have been a response to Hollywood’s initial reaction to Sora, which was not great.\nAs OpenAI adds restrictions to Sora, the company seems to be taking a more hands-off approach to moderating content in ChatGPT. OpenAI announced this week that it would allow adult users to have “erotic” chats with ChatGPT in the coming months.\nWith Sora, it seems that OpenAI is grappling with the concerns that come along with AI video generation. Some OpenAI researchers publicly wrestled with questions about the company’s first AI-powered social media platform in the days after its launch, and how such a product fits into the nonprofit’s mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company felt “trepidation” about Sora on launch day.\nNick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, told me earlier this month that the best way to teach the world about a new technology is putting it out in the world. He said that’s what the company learned with ChatGPT, and that’s what OpenAI is finding with Sora, too. It seems the company is learning something about how to distribute this technology, as well.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

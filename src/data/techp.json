    "body": "\nYouTube is conducting a “voluntary exit program” with severance for U.S.-based employees, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday. The news was first reported by Sources.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan told employees about the program via an internal memo on Wednesday.\nThe memo also announced that the Google-owned company was reorganizing its product teams into three separate organizations that all report directly to Mohan. The “Subscription Products” team will focus on YouTube’s subscription products across YouTube Music & Premium and OTT.\nThe “Viewer Products” team will focus on the viewer experience across the main YouTube app, YouTube Kids, Learning, Trust & Safety, and more. Last, the “Creator & Community Products” organization will focus on supporting creators and building community. \nThe company says no roles are being eliminated as part of these changes.\nThe move comes as Alphabet released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, reporting that YouTube’s advertising revenue hit $10.26 billion in the period, marking a 15% year-over-year increase.\n"

GM will also idle those battery factories starting on January 5, according to the Wall Street Journal, with plans to resume production in the middle of 2026.\nThe job cuts come just a few days after GM announced layoffs to some of its white-collar workforce and announced a $1.6 billion hit as it reworks its electric vehicle plans.\nGM also recently ended its BrightDrop commercial electric van program. The company — and many of its rivals — are pushing EVs less in the United States after the loss of the federal tax credit and the loosening of regulatory restrictions on internal combustion vehicles.\n"

Bending Spoons has never sold an acquired business—we’re confident we’re the right long-term steward for AOL, and look forward to serving its large, loyal customer base for many years to come.”\nThe news doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported earlier this month that Yahoo was in talks to sell AOL to Bending Spoons for around $1.4 billion. \nWednesday’s news signals a new chapter for AOL, which was once one of the most recognized brands on the internet, known for its email service and “You’ve Got Mail” notification.

    "body": "\nFubo and Hulu Live TV are officially joining forces.\nAfter some buzz earlier this year about the groundbreaking transaction, it’s now a done deal. The two companies announced on Wednesday that they’ve wrapped up their agreement to combine Fubo’s sports-centric platform with Hulu’s live TV service, following a nod of approval from Fubo shareholders last month.\nThis is a game-changer in the streaming landscape as the new entity becomes the sixth-largest Pay TV provider in the U.S., boasting nearly 6 million subscribers. That puts the newly combined company in direct competition with YouTube TV, which leads with around 10 million subscribers.\nAlthough this deal creates a larger entity and impacts market competition by reducing the number of independent streaming players, sources report that Disney and Fubo have received clearance from the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to proceed with the transaction.\nOne key highlight is the integration of Fubo’s sports offering with Hulu’s comprehensive entertainment library. Together, the platform offers an impressive lineup of over 55,000 live sporting events each year, a significant draw for sports fans. Additionally, Fubo subscribers will have access to a substantial collection of popular shows and movies that were previously unavailable to them. \nAnother benefit of the merger is that it will offer customers more flexible options. The companies plan to offer several plan options, including smaller “skinny” bundles and more “robust” offerings, all at prices the two companies consider competitive.\nHowever, users can still access both platforms separately — Fubo will keep its dedicated app, while Hulu Live TV will remain part of the Hulu platform, included in Disney’s bundle that features Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN Unlimited. \nDisney will hold approximately a 70% interest in the newly combined company, while existing Fubo shareholders will retain around 30%. Additionally, the combined company will have access to a $145 million term loan that Disney has agreed to provide to Fubo in 2026 as part of the transaction.\nThis announcement comes on the heels of intriguing developments regarding Paramount’s interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Reports indicate that Paramount CEO David Ellison wants to discontinue HBO Max as a standalone streaming service and merge its content and user base into Paramount+.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nCluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: you should be thinking harder about how to go viral.\n“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at Disrupt 2025.\nBut he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. \n“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”\nCluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andressen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.\nAs Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”\nFor Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Reputation is sort of a thing of the past,” Lee said. “You can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you’ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you’ve got Elon Musk going batshit crazy.”\n“You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” he continued, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic and you have to be personal.”\nIt’s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, however, Lee demurred. \n“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said.“I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nBox co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn’t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.\n “Generally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems — just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,” explained Levie.\n“If you’re doing something mission critical — we’ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn’t expect. So you want to have some sort of ‘church and state’ between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.”\nHe painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said. \nIn addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS. \n“The thing that I’m very convinced of is we’ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you’ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,” Levie said.\nAs a result, the typical “per-seat” business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents. \nThese changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes. \nSmaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.\nThis presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.\nHe encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building. \n“We are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is — there’s a complete platform shift happening in tech that’s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,” Levie said.\n“And I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe rise of agentic coding tools has been a sea change for software engineers across the industry — but for Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, it seems to have landed particularly hard. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Yakovenko said he’s become increasingly comfortable taking a back seat in software development tasks.\n“AI has been a great force multiplier for somebody who’s an expert,” said Yakovenko, describing his experience with agentic coding after more than 15 years developing software. “Now I can just watch Claude churning through its thing and I can almost smell when it’s going off the rails.”\n“If people are in a meeting with me and I’m not paying attention,” he continued, “it’s because I’m watching Claude.”\nCo-founder of the Solana cryptocurrency protocol, Yakovenko has seen immense success this year, even as many cryptocurrencies have struggled. The system announced $2.85 billion in annual revenue earlier this month, fueled largely by crypto trading platforms. Even more impressive was the Solana coin’s first exchange-traded fund (or ETF), launched the day before Yakovenko took the stage. Launched by the crypto asset manager Bitwise, the fund saw nearly $70 million of inflows in a single day.\nOnstage, Yakovenko attributed the success to a growing acceptance of crypto, especially from the conventional finance industry. “If you are a back-office finance person, you actually get crypto much, much faster,” Yakovenko said. “Finance people deal with settlement risk all the time. They deal with banking risk all the time.”\nOver the same period, cryptocurrency has drawn significant new criticism for enabling public bribery, particularly in connection with the Solana-hosted Trumpcoin. The coin has directed an estimated $350 million to the president, which critics see as a form of bribery — particularly in the wake of Trump’s high-profile pardons for Tron founder Justin Sun and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\nBut as long as Solana is an open protocol, Yakovenko has little control over the coins it hosts. “I could send you an email with a link to Trumpcoin or Fartcoin,” Yakovenko explained onstage, “and both of those are protocols, both the email and the underlying protocol that creates that market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThe 2024 runner-up in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, geCKo Materials, returned to the stage at this year’s show to debut new products as it pushes deeper into commercializing its tech.\nFounder Dr. Capella Kerst revealed four new uses of geCKo’s super-strong dry adhesive: a semiconductor wafer handling tool, a robotic gripper for smooth surfaces (like solar panels or glass), a curved robotic “end effector” for more irregular shapes, and an all-purpose gripper for robotic arms.\nThe geCKo tech is inspired by the way real-life lizards use their feet to grip surfaces. Kerst positions it like a new form of Velcro, but one that leaves no residue, can quickly attach and detach, and requires no electrical charge or suction. A one-inch tile of the material can hold 16 pounds, and the geCKo dry adhesive can attach as many as 120,000 times — and can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or years.\nThe ability to quickly adapt the dry adhesive to existing manufacturing, picking, and other robotic applications has proven popular. Kerst’s company won over Ford, NASA, and Pacific Gas & Electric as customers before she even competed on last year’s Battlefield stage.\n“Has this year flown by as quickly for anybody else as it has for us?” Kerst said on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage on Wednesday. The geCKo CEO said her company has tripled the size of her team since last year’s show and completed an $8 million fundraise.

    "body": "\nWaymo and Zoox robotaxis are a regular sight on San Francisco streets, and soon Uber, through a partnership with Lucid and Nuro, will descend on the city as well. It is exactly how San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie likes it.\n“I think we should be the testbed for emerging technology and AI and healthcare tech — and all of it,” Lurie said Wednesday on the main stage of TechCrunch Disrupt. “We always have been, and under my leadership, we will continue to lead and lean in.”\nLurie added that he is proud of the success that Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle tech company, has had in the Bay Area. And, he said “we welcome others.”\nLurie was quick to say that safety comes first, adding that autonomous vehicles are regulated at the state level. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. But companies that want to offer and charge for robotaxi rides must also get permits from the California Public Utilities Commission.\nWhile Lurie is opening his arms to autonomous vehicles, other cities are more resistant. Boston, for instance, has considered a ban on autonomous vehicles in the city. \n“Waymo has proven out it is a safe ride,” he said, noting that the robotaxis have attracted tourists who come to the city to take a ride in the driverless vehicles. “We’re hoping it opens at the airport shortly, and can take people here into the city.”\nThat doesn’t mean there won’t be some resistance. For instance, the Teamsters Union has lobbied for restrictions on self-driving trucks in a bid to protect jobs. \nLurie, meanwhile, has taken a bullish view on tech and the money and jobs it can bring to the city. \n“We believe in the future,” he said. “The future starts always in San Francisco, and we’re going to lean into it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "description": "With Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as \"AirNode operators\" will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage.",
    "body": "\nNBA champion Tristan Thompson announced at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that he’s partnering with global telecom company World Mobile to launch a community-owned mobile network called Uplift. The network offers unlimited data plans starting at $9.99 per month.\nUplift is built on blockchain technology and a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN).\nWith Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as “AirNode operators” will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage. The idea behind Uplift is to challenge the $2 trillion telecom industry’s centralized model by allowing users and local operators to share in the value they create.\n“For me, it’s about, how can I help people that have walked the same life that I walked, and I think for us, what we’re doing is providing connectivity and connection for unlimited data at a way lower cost,” Thompson said onstage. “It’s like, how can I help my community have a better tomorrow? And that’s what this is about. And I’ve been very blessed and fortunate to have a team that understands this vision. And we want to help people in America, help the inner city, and just give people hope.”\nWhile Thompson is known for his basketball career and winning the NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he’s also an outspoken advocate for innovation and inclusion. Thompson currently holds four C-suite roles across the web3 and fintech landscape. He’s the chief digital equity officer at World Mobile and the chief advisory officer at AxonDAO, an AI-powered medical research platform inspired by his brother’s epilepsy journey.\nImage Credits:Getty Images for TechCrunch\nHe’s also the co-founder of Basketball Fun, a web3 platform that tokenizes NBA players, and he’s the chief content officer at Tracy AI, an AI platform for real-time sports analytics.\nWith this latest endeavor, Thompson and World Mobile are looking to drive affordable community-owned internet access. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWorld Mobile says this is a tested and scalable model, as it piloted it in Reno, Nevada, where community hosts have earned more than $10,000 annually by providing coverage to underserved areas. Uplift operates on infrastructure already proven through World Mobile’s U.S. deployments, World Mobile says.\n“We brought about 20% of Reno back to connectivity,” Thompson said. “When the hurricane happened in North Carolina and Asheville, Starlink went out there and tried to bring connectivity, and they weren’t able to, so they reached out to the World Mobile team, and we were able to get out there and send a couple of our guys on helicopters to fly in, and we were actually the ones that brought connectivity back to Asheville, North Carolina, during that hurricane.”\nThe new service will begin rolling out in Cleveland, Ohio, soon and will launch in additional cities in 2026.\nWorld Mobile notes that more than 50 million Americans live at or near the poverty line, with many lacking access to affordable high-speed data. Uplift aims to expand access while ensuring that wealth generated by mobile usage stays in the neighborhoods that create it.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Each was selected to represent the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After all that intense pitching, we have a winner.\nThese startups were handpicked to compete in Startup Battlefield, and all of them presented a live demo in front of the VCs and tech leaders who judged the competition.\nAfter hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Charter Space, Glīd, MacroCycle, Nephrogen, and Unlisted Homes.\nThe final five made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, and Digg founder Kevin Rose. \nWe’re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is:\nWinner: Glīd\nGlīd (pronounced “Glide”) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks.\nRead more about Glīd in our separate post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRunner-up: Nephrogen\nNephrogen is a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney.

    "description": "Now again under Rose's control, the new Digg is creating a place for people to socialize and connect online within communities, similar to Reddit, but it has different ideas about how such a platform should work at a time when bots are nearly indistinguishable from humans.",
    "body": "\n“The dead internet theory is real,” Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian told Digg founder Kevin Rose, referring to the idea that much of the internet isn’t human — it’s mostly bots. \nThe two entrepreneurs have since teamed up to re-envision how to build a social community in this world where, very soon, it will be hard to tell who’s a real person online. \nEarlier this year, the two bought the remaining assets belonging to Digg, the long-shuttered news aggregation site originally founded by Rose that was a staple of the Web 2.0 era. \nNow again under Rose’s control, the new Digg is creating a place for people to socialize and connect online within communities, similar to Reddit, but it has different ideas about how such a platform should work at a time when bots are nearly indistinguishable from humans. \nBackstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday, Rose explained that he sees the future of social as being more focused on protected online spaces and “micro communities of trusted users.” \n“I just have to imagine that, as the cost to deploy agents drops to next to nothing, we’re just gonna see…bots act as though they’re humans,” he said. “So, small trusted communities, proof of heartbeat — there’s an actual human on the other end…is important.” \nBut today’s verification methods often involve things like facial recognition, ID uploads, or small payments with a credit card to ensure that someone is a person and not a bot. Not everyone online will feel comfortable doing something like that to access an online social community, of course.  \nThat’s why Digg is looking to use newer technology, like a ZK proof (ZKP) to verify people using its platform in the future.\nSays Rose, the ZKP is a “fancy piece of math” which doesn’t expose who someone is, but can verify something essential that would be important for their participation in an online community. \nFor instance, a moderator of a community for Oura ring owners could use the technology to verify that someone is actually an Oura ring owner before allowing them to post. That identity could stay with them so they’re known as a trusted member, but not necessarily one where they have to go by their real name. This could be particularly useful in communities focused on sensitive topics or health issues, as well. \nConnie Loizos, Editor-in-Chief & GM of TechCrunch, and Kevin Rose, Founder, Digg, speak onstage during day three of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 at Moscone Center on October 29, 2025 in San Francisco, California Image Credits:Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch\nThe idea that moderators should have more of a say over their communities is also essential to the new Digg — and, Rose believes, these founding members should be compensated for their efforts. \n“When we first started Digg in 2004 — before Reddit launched — we were very lucky because we had thousands and thousands of people, and eventually millions of people, that would come in and contribute content,” said Rose, during his panel at the TechCrunch Disrupt event.  “And they’re not getting paid.”\nHe said that some Reddit moderators are essentially working around the clock to handle things like spam and fighting, but aren’t receiving any slice of the revenue, nor do they control the audience. \n“So you’re talking about something where you’re signing up and creating all this value for a platform, but you can’t port that platform anywhere else. You can’t capture any email addresses. You can’t stay in touch on that platform. You can be ousted [from] that platform,” he said. \nRose also pointed to issues where larger Reddit communities can become trademarked — something that prevented the founder of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit from writing a book using the name of the community they had created. \n“If anything, we should be more similar to Substack or Patreon, or some others that are actually giving you much more control of your community,” he said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "Prosecutors confirmed Peter Williams, the former Trenchant boss, sold eight exploits to a Russian buyer. TechCrunch exclusively reported that the Trenchant division was investigating a leak of its hacking tools, after another employee was accused of involvement.",
    "body": "\nPeter Williams, the former general manager at defense contractor L3Harris, has pleaded guilty to selling surveillance technology to a Russian broker that buys “cyber tools,” the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Wednesday. \n“The material, stolen over a three-year period from the U.S. defense contractor where he worked, was comprised of national-security focused software that included at least eight sensitive and protected cyber-exploit components,” read the DOJ’s press release on Wednesday. “Those components were meant to be sold exclusively to the U.S. government and select allies.”\nTechCrunch previously exclusively reported, citing four former Trenchant employees, that the company was investigating a leak of its hacking tools. Prosecutors now say Williams exploited his access to the company’s “secure network to steal the cyber exploit components.”\nWilliams headed Trenchant, the division at L3Harris that develops spyware, exploits, and zero-days — security vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to its maker. Trenchant sells its surveillance tech to government customers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Trenchant was founded after L3Harris in 2019 acquired two Australian sister startups, Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, which developed and sold zero-days to the Five Eyes alliance of countries. \nThe DOJ said Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resides in Washington, D.C., sold exploits to the unnamed Russian broker, who promised Williams millions of dollars in cryptocurrency in exchange. The former Trenchant general manager allegedly signed contracts with the broker that stipulated an initial payment for the exploits, and periodic payments “for follow-on” support. \nProsecutors did not name the Russian broker Williams sold to, but said that the broker publicly bills itself as a reseller of exploits to several customers, including the Russian government. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nU.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Wednesday that the broker whom Williams sold exploits to is part of “the next wave of international arms dealers.” Pirro said Williams’ crimes caused over $35 million in losses to Trenchant. \n“Williams betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software,” said U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “His conduct was deliberate and deceitful, imperiling our national security for the sake of personal gain.”\nL3Harris spokesperson Sara Banda declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch on Wednesday.\nJohn Rowley, one of Williams’ attorneys, declined to comment.\nOn October 14, the U.S. government accused Williams, who is known in the industry as “Doogie,” of selling trade secrets to a buyer in Russia, without specifying what those trade secrets were nor what company he stole them from. According to a document filed in mid-October, Williams made $1.3 million for the sale of the exploits. \nWilliams pleaded guilty to two charges of stealing trade secrets, which each can carry a sentence of 10 years in prison. He will be sentenced in January 2026, prosecutors said. \nAccording to Risky Business host and journalist Patrick Gray, Williams is currently under house arrest in the Washington, D.C. area where he lives. Gray said Williams used to work at the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), the country’s top signals intelligence and eavesdropping agency. \nWhen previously reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the ASD would not comment on Williams, citing a law enforcement matter. \nLast week, TechCrunch reported that Williams had fired a Trenchant developer earlier this year who was suspected of stealing Chrome zero-days. The former Trenchant employee told TechCrunch that he never had access to those tools, as he worked on developing iOS zero-days. Other of his former colleagues supported his account.\n“I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn’t guilty. It’s very simple,” the exploit developer told TechCrunch. “I didn’t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.” \nThis story was updated with the response from Williams’ attorney John Rowley.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

Its existing investors include Andreessen Horowitz, among others.\nThe round, which was Fal’s third fundraise this year, valued the company at $4.5 billion, about three times what the company was worth when it raised its $125 million Series C in July, Bloomberg reported.\nTechCrunch reported in October that Fal raised a new round from investors, including Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins at a valuation of over $4 billion. We also reported at the time that the raise was around $250 million, according to our sources. This higher amount reflects the $140 million capital raised from the company and a secondary sale where existing investors sold shares, people familiar with the deal tell TechCrunch.\nFal provides the infrastructure layer for multimodal AI for customers, including Adobe, Shopify, Canva, and Quora.

    "body": "\nSpaceX is planning to go public in mid-to-late 2026 and is looking to raise $30 billion at a valuation of around $1.5 trillion, according to a new report from Bloomberg News citing multiple unidentified sources.\nThat would make it the largest IPO of all time, edging out Saudi Aramco’s public listing in 2019, which brought in $29 billion. It would also be a bit of a reversal for SpaceX, which previously considered spinning off its Starlink division for an IPO, while keeping the main company private.\nBloomberg’s report comes just a few days after The Information was first to report that Elon Musk’s space company was targeting a late 2026 IPO. \nThe Wall Street Journal also recently broke the news that SpaceX was engaged in another secondary share sale for employees that would peg the company’s current valuation at around $800 billion. Bloomberg’s report says SpaceX has “firmed up” that share sale in recent days and the valuation is above the $800 billion figure, with employees being allowed to sell around $2 billion worth of shares at $420 per share.\nThis story has been corrected to have $1.5T in the headline, not $1.5B.\n"

    "body": "\nIt’s been quite the year for CoreWeave. In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype.\nAnother setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. \nIn the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market. \nIn an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.  \n“I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. \n“We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. \nCoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSome of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%.\nIntrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. \nCoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.  \nAnother topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base.\n"

    "body": "\nMeesho, an Indian e-commerce marketplace, had a good first day as a public company, with its shares climbing as much as 46% from its issue price as investors jumped to grab a piece of the company built around small merchants and value-conscious consumers.\nThe stock opened at ₹162.50, up from the issue price of ₹111, and reached a high of ₹171.84, giving Meesho a market capitalization of ₹780 billion (around $8.69 billion). The company raised $606 million in the IPO.\n10-year-old Meesho was last valued at about $5 billion following a private funding round in 2021.\nElevation Capital, Peak XV Partners and Y Combinator were among the early shareholders who have sold their stakes in the IPO. Investors including SoftBank, Prosus and Fidelity haven’t sold any shares yet.\nFounded in 2015, Meesho started off as WhatsApp-based social-commerce platform for first-time online shoppers. It has managed to compete successfully with incumbents like Flipkart and Amazon by leaning into a low-cost marketplace model aimed at connecting small merchants with price-sensitive consumers across smaller towns in the country. In the past 12 months, it reported 234.2 million transacting users, 706,471 annual sellers, and over 50,000 active content creators.\n“Ringing the bell generally means trading,” said Meesho co-founder and CEO Vidit Aatrey during the public listing ceremony. “But today, for me at Meesho, for everyone at Meesho, this ringing basically means that our mission is not just our mission. Now it’s everyone’s mission.”\nIn the six months ended September 30, Meesho generated revenue of ₹55.78 billion (approximately $620.3 million), up from ₹43.11 billion (around $479.6 million) a year earlier, according to its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% to ₹191.94 billion (about $2.14 billion) in the same period. However, the company’s losses widened to ₹4.33 billion (roughly $48.2 million), compared with ₹0.24 billion (around $2.7 million) a year earlier.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Bengaluru-based company compares itself to other value-driven marketplaces like Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America. However, its commission-light model has increased pressure on Indian rivals Amazon and Flipkart.\nMeesho’s listing follows a slew of startup IPOs in India. In the past few months Pine Labs, Groww, Lenskart, Physics Wallah, and Capillary Technologies have gone public, and the momentum is expected to continue next year, with Flipkart, Oyo, and PhonePe preparing for listings.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFertility startup Inito has raised $29 million in Series B funding to scale its at-home health diagnostics platform and use AI-designed antibodies to unlock new kinds of at-home tests. \nWhen the company launched its first fertility monitor in 2021, its goal was to make quantitative fertility hormone testing possible at home. \nWhile standard at-home ovulation tests predict fertile days by tracking estrogen and Luteinizing hormone (LH), they don’t measure the hormone that confirms your ovulation, which is progesterone metabolite PdG. Inito allows women to measure estrogen, LH, progesterone (PdG), and FSH on a single test strip. Inito’s AI models interpret these levels to reveal fertility hormone patterns, track fertile days, and confirm ovulation.\nFast forward to today, the startup has become a popular option for women looking to track fertility hormones, analyzing more than 30 million fertility hormone data points since 2021.\nThe startup is now doubling down on its belief that healthcare should start at home, and is working to evolve Inito from a fertility tracker into a broader hormone and at-home health diagnostics platform. \nImage Credits:Inito\nInito is using the new funding to invest in and develop AI-engineered antibodies, which it says will allow for the development of new types of tests and improve the accuracy of existing ones.\nFor context, when you take a test at a lab or a home, antibodies are what bind to the target molecule (such as estrogen or testosterone) to produce a signal. Traditional antibodies are grown inside animals and then screened manually in the lab, which can be a slow and expensive process. Conventional antibodies also lack the sensitivity to make at-home tests for a large number of biomarkers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInito says AI-designed antibodies change the game. Instead of “raising” antibodies in animals, they can be treated almost like software. \n“We predict how proteins fold in 3D, design synthetic antibodies using AI, and test millions of variants virtually before making a single one in the lab,” explained Inito co-founder and CTO Varun A Venkatesan in an email. “This produces antibodies that are far more sensitive, consistent, and stable than anything developed through traditional methods.”\nFor Inito, this will unlock the next generation of at-home tests. Venkatesan says the company is already using these methods in R&D and that its wet-lab is showing promising results. \nImage Credits:Inito\n“The real vision is bigger than adding new tests,” said Inito co-founder and CEO Aayush Rai. “The endgame is to redefine diagnostics altogether. If you want to understand what’s happening inside your body at every life stage and health need, you shouldn’t be limited by clinic appointments, lab schedules, or rigid testing systems. You should be able to measure, track, and get insights about your body from home, with lab-grade confidence.”\nInito wants to expand its vision beyond a “trying to conceive” platform. Its reader and app will soon power tests for pregnancy, menopause, and broader at-home health monitoring. \n“Our long-term roadmap goes far beyond fertility,” said Rai. “We’re building toward a platform that can measure and interpret the full spectrum of hormones that shape health across a lifetime. Pregnancy progression, menopause, and broader endocrine markers like testosterone — all powered by AI antibodies and imaging that sets Inito apart today.”\nThe company is going to use part of the funding to scale manufacturing and grow globally to meet growing demand across the United States and new international markets. \nInito’s latest funding round was led by Bertelsmann India Investments and Fireside Ventures. The investment brings Inito’s total funding to around $45 million. The company previously raised $6 million in funding led by Fireside Ventures and $9 million from Y Combinator, former Nurx CEO Varsha Rao, and a dozen physicians and family offices.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMarket research is a $90 billion industry that helps brands figure out how to best present themselves to potential customers. But that market insight isn’t cheap, nor is it quick. Cashew Research wants to change that using AI.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Cashew uses AI to develop market research plans and surveys for brands based on what information they are looking for — like what their brand recognition is for a specific population or how a marketing tagline resonates with customers. Cashew then sends the survey to real people and uses AI to summarize and digest the findings.\nCashew was one of the 200 startups chosen for TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition in 2025 and won the Enterprise Stage pitch competition at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n“You can use an LLM to try to do deep research and get answers to your questions, or you could use a firm that’s going to be really expensive,” Addy Graves, co-founder and CEO of Cashew, told TechCrunch in describing the current market research industry. “Now there’s Cashew that exists in the middle. It creates custom, fresh data to answer your question instead of you just using an LLM that’s surfacing the same recycled pool of data that everybody’s finding on the internet.”\nGraves has more than a decade of market research experience. The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days.\nFor years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet.\n“That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added.\nGraves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage.\nGraves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said.\nCashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too.\nThe company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech.\nGraves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business.\n“The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAnysphere, the company that makes AI coding assistant darling Cursor, isn’t thinking about an IPO any time soon, its co-founder CEO Michael Truell said onstage Monday at Fortune’s AI Brainstorm conference.\nAfter reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue in November and raising $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation last month, Truell said his company is instead focused on building out more features.\nFor instance, he noted that Cursor’s homegrown LLMs were geared to support specific products. Cursor also confirmed the existence of those models in November when it said in a blog post, “Our in-house models now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.”\nHis comments about the models came up at Fortune’s event when the founder was asked how he plans to compete with the LLM makers that he relies on when the major ones — OpenAI, Anthropic — have their own AI coding offerings.\nTruell likened their coding products to “a concept car,” whereas his product is a production automobile.\n“It would be like taking an engine and a concept car around it instead of a whole end-to-end car that was manufactured,” Truell said. “What we do is we take the best intelligence that the market has to offer from many different providers. And we also do our own product-specific models in places. We take that, we build it together and integrate it, then also build the best tool and end UX for working with AI.”\nCursor’s dependence on its competitors — and its need to build its own LLMs — has been a subject of speculation among VCs in Silicon Valley since earlier this year when OpenAI reportedly looked at Anysphere as an acquisition target. Anysphere turned the idea down. (This was around the same time that Windsurf’s OpenAI deal also didn’t materialize, with the founder eventually joining Google.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe issue, investors told TechCrunch, was that AI coding editors were losing money thanks to high costs they paid to the model makers. In Cursor’s case, instead of selling, it adjusted pricing to a usage model in July, directly passing along the API fees that model makers charge to its users. This change from an all-inclusive subscription fee (and the surprise big bills some customers faced) caused an uproar among some of its users.\nOn Monday, when asked about the pricing kerfuffle, Truell said, “When we started Cursor, you would turn to Cursor for a quick JavaScript question and now you’re turning to it to do hours of work for you. So the pricing model had to shift for us and others in the space. That means shifting more towards a consumption model,” he said.\nTruell added that one of the tools the company is working on is cloud-computing-like cost-management tools, which lets enterprises monitor their total usage and keep tabs on the bills their engineers are running up.\n“We have a whole team internally dedicated to enterprise engineering and building things like spend controls and billing groups and visibility,” he said.\nAdditionally, he said Cursor is focused on two major areas for the next year. One is handling more complex agentic functions. \n“We want you to take end-to-end tasks, ones that are concise to specify but then are really hard to do, and have them entirely be done by Cursor. An example is a bug fix,” Truell explained. \nHe particularly wants Cursor to be able to fix the kinds of bugs that might be easy to describe but take “weeks of someone’s time, thousands of times running the code” to handle. “We want Cursor to do that, end-to-end,” he said.\nThe other area he named, but didn’t explain with much detail, was the idea of “thinking about teams as the atomic unit that we serve,” he said. This must be in contrast to serving individual coders, and a hint to how well its enterprise business is going. \nIn addition to cost-monitoring features, Truell said he wants Cursor to handle more parts of the software development life cycle outside of writing code. He pointed to Cursor’s code review product as an example, which he said is being used by some customers to analyze every pull request, be it written by AI or human. (A pull request is when a programmer submits code for review before it is merged into the main project.)\n“So you’ll see us start to help teams more as a whole,” with more features like that, he promised.\nMeanwhile, big competitors are also all gearing up for the complex-task agentic world. Amazon just released a coding tool it promises can already run for days on end. \nJust this week, the AI power players, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and many others, launched a new consortium under the Linux Foundation to develop open source agentic interoperability standards. They even contributed some of their key projects, like Anthropic’s wildly popular Model Context Protocol (MCP).\nHis plans for the year likely won’t put Anysphere firmly ahead of Cursor’s main model-maker competitors. They should, however, keep the company in the race.\n"

    "body": "\nTruecaller has launched a household-level scam-protection feature as the Swedish company broadens its role beyond caller ID in response to the rising number of fraud attempts that target multiple members of a home.\nThe new feature, called Family Protection, lets up to five people join a family group overseen by one member who acts as the administrator and manages scam-blocking settings for the others. Family Protection is initially rolling out as a pilot for Android and iOS users in Sweden, Chile, Malaysia, and Kenya.\nTruecaller said the feature is designed so that the more digitally confident person in a household can handle scam controls on behalf of less tech-savvy family members.\nOn Android, the family administrator can receive alerts during suspected scam calls; view basic device status, including battery level; and remotely end calls flagged as fraudulent, the company said.\nScam activity has been rising worldwide as more people come online. That activity has exploded in markets where first-time smartphone users and older adults are more exposed to fraud. Countries, including India, have reported sharp increases in impersonation attempts and multi-step schemes that exploit gaps in digital familiarity. Truecaller plans to address this with its new feature, which will expand into additional key regions, including India, in the first quarter of 2026.\nImage Credits:Truecaller\nTruecaller CEO Rishit Jhunjhunwala told TechCrunch the company has seen scammers shift from targeting individuals to entire households, with schemes unfolding through a sequence of calls, messages, missed-call triggers, and impersonation attempts directed at multiple family members to find a vulnerable entry point. The trend prompted the launch of the multi-user protection system, he said.\nFamily Protection is available as a free feature to users. However, if the family administrator upgrades to a Premium Family plan, all members get an ad-free experience along with stronger spam defense and automatic rejection of high-risk calls, the company stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith a user base of more than 450 million worldwide, Truecaller detects about 63 million scam attempts a day, allowing it to track shifts in fraud schemes in real time. The company says its community also reports around 166 million spam calls daily, creating one of the largest datasets of phone-based fraud activity globally.\nHowever, Truecaller faces new competition in India, its largest market, as the government there starts trials of a Caller Name Presentation system that will display the name registered with telecom providers on incoming calls. Truecaller has been adding features that go beyond caller ID, including Family Protection, as it adapts to regulatory and market changes in India and other key markets.\n“With Family Protection, one person’s vigilance now strengthens safety for up to five family members,” said Jhunjhunwala, adding that the company aims to extend protection without requiring additional effort from users.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEnhanced geothermal startup Fervo Energy has raised $462 million to complete its first large-scale power plant and begin development on several others as it races to provide electricity to a power-hungry grid.\nThe new funds will help the company continue work on its 500-megawatt Cape Station power plant in Utah while starting development on several others, Sara Jewett, senior vice president of strategy at Fervo, told TechCrunch. \nThe new round was led by B Capital with participation from AllianceBernstein, Atacama Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, CalSTRS, Capricorn Investment Group, Carbon Equity, Centaurus Capital, Climate First, Congruent Ventures, CPP Investments, Devon Energy, Echelon, Galvanize, Google, Impact Science Ventures, Kris Singh, JB Straubel, Liberty Mutual Investments, Marunouchi Innovation Partners, Mercuria, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsui and Co., and Sabanci Climate Ventures.\nFervo has an existing deal with Google to supply it with electricity for its data centers.\nFervo has targeted 2026 to bring the first phase of Cape Station online, and Jewett confirmed that it will be “mechanically complete” this year. “It’s very real and very tangible.”\nThe new round comes six months after the startup announced a $206 million financing package, including loans and project-level preferred equity, for Cape Station. Last year, Fervo raised nearly $500 million in equity and debt.\nEnhanced geothermal has been in development for years but has recently soared as favorable conditions have lifted its prospects. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChief among them is rising data center demand. Large tech companies like Google and Meta have been eyeing geothermal as a potential solution to their energy needs. Earlier this year, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that by 2030, enhanced geothermal could provide nearly two-thirds of new data center demand at or below what operators are paying today.\nGeothermal is also viewed favorably within the Trump administration. Energy secretary Chris Wright’s previous company, Liberty Energy, participated in a $138 million round that Fervo raised in 2022. Like many of its peers, the company uses fracking and directional drilling techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry. Many Fervo employees used to work in oil and gas, applying their knowledge of drilling and subsurface development to a new challenge.\nFervo is considered a frontrunner among enhanced geothermal startups, which drill deeper than existing geothermal developers to tap hotter rocks and deliver more power.\nThat knowledge has helped Fervo bring down the time it takes to drill a new well. The company’s first wells took about a month, but this summer, Fervo announced that it had completed one in 16 days. “We are in the mid-teens these days, on average, for our well drilling times,” Jewett said. “That is pretty good, but we always have more improvements to make.”\nThe company’s obsession with drilling time is both economic and a point of pride. “Roughly half the cost of wells is in the drilling time,” Jewett said. Shorter drilling times mean that Fervo can complete power plants more quickly, bringing in revenue sooner. They’re also a sign of mastery. “It’s also a good representation of how much you’re investing in the well, how much you’re troubleshooting, how many issues are plaguing you that end up costing money,” she said.\nFor now, Fervo is focused on the Western U.S., where hot rocks sit closer to the surface. At the company’s Cape Station site in Utah, for example, Fervo has to drill down 8,500 feet to tap into 450˚ F rock. \n“If you go to Pennsylvania or West Virginia, [the hot rock] exists much lower,” Jewett said. Only after the company is comfortable with how quickly it can drill a well in the West will it expand elsewhere, including abroad.\n“There are a lot of really high-potential places across the world,” she said.\nWithin the U.S., though, there are plenty of different types of rock for Fervo to drill through, giving it the potential to build up sufficient technical experience before heading to other countries. By that point, Jewett expects that differences in regulations will be the primary hurdle.\nGiven skyrocketing energy demand from data centers and Fervo’s progress at Cape Station, there have been rumors that the company might file for go public in the coming year or so. Jewett wouldn’t comment on those, but she said that the company is seeing “off-the-charts demand.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nHinge CEO Justin McLeod is stepping down from his role to launch a new AI dating product called Overtone.\nMatch Group, the dating giant that owns apps like Hinge, Tinder, and OkCupid, is backing Overtone with pre-seed financing and plans to take a “substantial ownership position,” according to a press release.\nWith Match’s support, Overtone was incubated as a project inside of Hinge. McLeod and a dedicated team spent the year developing the idea of Overtone, which is described as “an early-stage dating service focused on using AI and voice tools to help people connect in a more thoughtful and personal way.”\nMcLeod isn’t the only dating app founder branching out into new, standalone AI experiences. Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of Bumble, said she wants to use AI to make “the world’s smartest and most emotionally intelligent matchmaker in existence.” Somewhat infamously, Wolfe Herd proposed the idea last year of singles using AI to stand-in for themselves and date other people’s AIs.\nIt’s not yet clear how Overtone will differentiate itself from other dating apps, which have been experimenting with AI features to compensate for the market’s growing malaise with online dating — especially among Gen Z.\nTinder has reported nine straight quarters of paying-subscriber declines and has leaned into AI with features that are supposed to help users get more matches. Hinge launched another AI feature just this week called “Convo Starters,” which is supposed to help daters come up with more interesting things to say than the usual small talk. Tinder and Facebook Dating have each experimented with AI-powered matching to combat “swipe fatigue.”\nCeding control of your dating experience is one thing, but other attempts at integrating AI into these apps get even more dubious. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMatch CEO Spencer Rascoff said last month that a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience” will be a feature called Chemistry. With the user’s permission, the feature will access users’ camera rolls to learn more about them. (For the record, we would advise that you do not give tech companies unfettered access to even more of your data.)\nMcLeod founded Hinge in 2011 as a dating app with a greater focus on building relationships than facilitating casual dates. The app, which is on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by 2027, was acquired by Match in 2019. Jackie Jantos, Hinge’s president and chief marketing officer, will take over as CEO. McLeod will remain in an advisory position at Hinge through March.\nThis summer, TechCrunch spoke to Jantos at SXSW London about how Hinge will address Gen Z, a market that’s growing increasingly disillusioned with meeting people online.\n“This is a generation that has grown up with a deep understanding of how digital experiences are created and what they are trying to get out of them,” Jantos told TechCrunch. \nGen Z wants transparency and authenticity from digital brands, according to Jantos. While some might see this as inherently incompatible with the company’s growing reliance on AI, Hinge’s AI recommendation feature, launched in March, drove a 15% increase in matches and contact exchanges in the first quarter of this year.\nBased on Jantos’ comments upon assuming her new role, it seems that Hinge will continue investing in these features under her leadership.\n“Our focus will remain on intentional innovation that is grounded in culture, creativity, and a deep understanding of how people connect today,” Jantos said in a statement.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nThe Pew Research Center released a study on Tuesday that shows how young people are using both social media and AI chatbots.\nTeen internet safety has remained a global hot topic, with Australia planning to enforce a social media ban for under-16s starting on Wednesday. The impact of social media on teen mental health has been extensively debated — some studies show how online communities can improve mental health, while other research shows the adverse effects of doomscrolling or spending too much time online. The U.S. surgeon general even called for social media platforms to put warning labels on their products last year.\nPew found that 97% of teens use the internet daily, with about 40% of respondents saying they are “almost constantly online.” While this marks a decrease from last year’s survey (46%), it’s significantly higher than the results from a decade ago, when 24% of teens said they were online almost constantly.\nBut as the prevalence of AI chatbots grows in the U.S., this technology has become yet another factor in the internet’s impact on American youth.\nImage Credits:Pew Research Center\nAbout three in 10 U.S. teens are using AI chatbots every day, the Pew study reveals, with 4% saying they use them almost constantly. Fifty-nine percent of teens say they use ChatGPT, which is more than twice as popular as the next two most-used chatbots, Google’s Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%). Forty-six percent of U.S. teens say that they use AI chatbots at least several times a week, while 36% report not using AI chatbots at all.\nPew’s research also details how race, age, and class impact teen chatbot use. \nAbout 68% of Black and Hispanic teens surveyed said they use chatbots, compared to 58% of white respondents. In particular, Black teens were about twice as likely to use Gemini and Meta AI as white teens.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The racial and ethnic differences in teen chatbot use were striking […] but it’s tough to speculate about the reasons behind those differences,” Pew Research Associate Michelle Faverio told TechCrunch. “This pattern is consistent with other racial and ethnic differences we’ve seen in teen technology use. Black and Hispanic teens are more likely than white teens to say they’re on certain social media sites — such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.”\nImage Credits:Pew Research Center\nAcross all internet use, Black (55%) and Hispanic teens (52%) were around twice as likely as white teens (27%) to say that they are online “almost constantly.” \nOlder teens (ages 15 to 17) tend to use both social media and AI chatbots more often than younger teens (ages 13 to 14). When it comes to household income, about 62% of teens living in households making more than $75,000 per year said they use ChatGPT, compared to 52% of teens below that threshold. But Character.AI usage is twice as popular (14%) in homes with incomes below $75,000.\nWhile teenagers may start out using these tools for basic questions or homework help, their relationship to AI chatbots can become addictive and potentially harmful. \nThe families of at least two teens, Adam Raine and Amaurie Lacey, have sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its alleged role in their children’s suicides — in both cases, ChatGPT gave the teenagers detailed instructions on how to hang themselves, which were tragically effective. \n(OpenAI claims it should not be held liable for Raine’s death because the sixteen-year-old allegedly circumvented ChatGPT’s safety features and thus violated the chatbot’s terms of service; the company has yet to respond to the Lacey family’s complaint.)\nCharacter.AI, an AI role-playing platform, is also facing scrutiny for its impact on teen mental health; at least two teenagers died by suicide after having prolonged conversations with AI chatbots. The startup ended up making the decision to stop offering its chatbots to minors, and instead launched a product called “Stories” for underage users that more closely resembles a choose-your-own-adventure game.\nThe experiences reflected in the lawsuits against these companies make up a small percentage of all interactions that happen on ChatGPT or Character.AI. In many cases, conversations with chatbots can be incredibly benign. According to OpenAI’s data, only 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users have conversations about suicide each week — but on a platform with 800 million weekly active users, that small percentage reflects over one million people who discuss suicide with the chatbot per week.\n“Even if [AI companies’] tools weren’t designed for emotional support, people are using them in that way, and that means companies do have a responsibility to adjust their models to be solving for user well-being,” Dr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

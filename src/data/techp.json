    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, Google released Gemini 3, its latest and most advanced foundation model, which is now immediately available through the Gemini app and AI search interface.\nComing just seven months after the Gemini 2.5 release, the new model is Google’s most capable LLM yet, and an immediate contender for the most capable AI tool on the market. The release also comes less than a week after OpenAI released GPT 5.1, and a mere two months after Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 — a reminder of the blistering pace of frontier model development.\nA more research-intensive version of the model, called Gemini 3 Deepthink, will also be made available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks, once it passes further rounds of safety testing.\n“With Gemini 3, we’re seeing this massive jump in reasoning,” said Tulsee Doshi, Google’s head of product for the Gemini model. “It’s responding with a level of depth and nuance that we haven’t seen before.”\nSome of that reasoning power is already registering on independent benchmarks. With a score of 37.4, the model marked the highest score on record on the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, meant to capture general reasoning and expertise. The previous high score, held by GPT-5 Pro, was 31.64. Gemini 3 also topped the leaderboard on LMArena, a human-led benchmark that measures user satisfaction.\nAccording to Google, the Gemini app currently has more than 650 million monthly active users, and 13 million software developers have used the model as part of their workflow.\nAlongside the base model, Google also released a Gemini-powered coding interface called Google Antigravity, allowing for multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0. Specifically, Antigravity combines a ChatGPT-style prompt window with a command-line interface and a browser window that can show the impact of the changes made by the coding agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The agent can work with your editor, across your terminal, across your browser to make sure that it helps you build that application in the best way possible,” said DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAfter primarily focusing on private conversations since its founding, Snapchat is embracing public conversations with a new “Topic Chats” feature. The social network says the feature lets users chat about what’s happening in the world and across various communities, from Formula 1 to the reality TV show “Below Deck.”\nProfiles will remain private to anyone you’re not friends with, helping prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages, Snapchat says. While a user’s display name will be visible next to their message, others won’t be able to tap through to their profile from a Topic Chat, the company told TechCrunch in an email. And unlike usernames, display names can’t be used to search for someone.\nSnapchat told TechCrunch that it will use LLM technology and other safety measures to moderate Topic Chats to keep them safe and appropriate. Additionally, messages must adhere to Snapchat’s Community Guidelines, and users can report inappropriate messages. The company says it will take action against users who violate its policies, including warning users and blocking accounts.\nUsers will be able to see which Topic Chats their friends have joined, which the company says will make it easier for people to find common interests with others.\nIn addition to messages, Topic Chats will also surface related Spotlight videos, which are the app’s TikTok-like short-form videos. \nUp until now, the only place for public conversations on Snapchat was in Spotlight comments. Snapchat says it was inspired to launch Topic Chats after seeing how its community interacts in public comments, as it wanted to give users a new way to have these conversations. \n“Snapchatters create billions of Snaps every day, sharing moments with friends and family, and as we’ve expanded services like Spotlight, we’ve also found that the Snapchat community loves commenting publicly about trending topics and events,” the company wrote in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUsers in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. will start seeing Topic Chats appear across Snapchat over the coming weeks in Chat shortcuts, in search, in the Stories page, and on Spotlight videos. If you see a big yellow button on a Story or Spotlight that says “Join the Chat,” you can click on it to enter a chatroom.\nSnapchat says messages sent in Topic Chats will be retained for up to five years.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday morning, a big chunk of the internet went down or was not working properly, including ChatGPT, Claude, Spotify, X, and more due to an outage at internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare. \nCloudflare said in its status page at around 8 am ET it had identified the issues and was implementing a fix. Less than two hours later, Cloudflare said “a fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal.”\nAround the same time, Cloudflare’s chief technology officer Dane Knecht explained that a latent bug was responsible in an apologetic X post. \n“In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack,” Knecht wrote, referring to a bug that goes undetected in testing and has not caused a failure. \nKnecht also said Cloudflare failed its customers and “the broader internet” with the outage, and promised that the company is already working to make sure “it does not happen again.” \n“I know it caused real pain today,” Knecht added, promising a more in-depth breakdown of what happened “in a few hours.”\nThe company has since noted on its status page that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard.

If these giants experience an issue, the whole of the internet start to crumble. \nAccording to an estimate, Cloudflare is used by 20% of all websites on the internet. The company says it has datacenters in 330 cities, and 13,000 networks “directly connect to Cloudflare, including every major ISP, cloud provider, and enterprise.” One of the main services Cloudflare offers customers is protection from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are designed to knock websites offline, which makes Tuesday’s outages somewhat ironic.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWaymo is taking the safety operators out of its fleet of robotaxis in Miami starting today, ahead of a commercial launch in 2026, the latest in a long series of steps taken this year to expand its nationwide footprint.\nThe company said in a blog post Tuesday it will start offering fully autonomous trips to employees in Miami. Over the next few weeks, Waymo said it will do the same in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.\nThis latest move comes just one week after Waymo announced a major milestone: it is now offering paid rides on highways in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix. This year has also seen Waymo launch in Atlanta and Austin with big-name partners like Uber, and launch a corporate travel program.\nWaymo’s not the only company trying to scale a robotaxi service in the United States. Amazon-owned Zoox announced earlier Tuesday morning it is about to start offering free rides in its purpose-built robotaxis to members of its early rider program in San Francisco. (It did the same in Las Vegas in September.)\nTesla, meanwhile, has been trialing a service of its own in Austin for a few months. At one point this year, CEO Elon Musk tried to claim Tesla’s robotaxi service would be available to half the country by the end of 2025. As of right now, his company’s cars still have safety operators in the driver’s seats.\nAmid all that potential competition, Waymo is acting pretty confident.\n“We haven’t just built the technology; we’ve developed the definitive playbook for operating autonomous fleets, across dozens of sites, and industry-leading end-to-end rider support,” the company wrote in Tuesday’s blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt will need that confidence as it heads into 2026, which is shaping up to be an even bigger year than 2025. In addition to the five aforementioned cities, Waymo plans to start offering rides in Detroit, Las Vegas, San Diego, Nashville, and London. The company is also testing in New York City, and has a permit to keep that up until at least the end of the year.\n“By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,” co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said at TechCrunch Disrupt last month.\nWaymo’s expansion hasn’t been flawless, though. The company’s tech is currently being probed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after one of its vehicles in Atlanta was filmed turning in front of a stopped school bus.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAs part of Microsoft’s Ignite conference, Stack Overflow on Tuesday revealed a new set of products that aims to position it as a valuable part of the enterprise AI stack. This new version of the company, built around the Stack Overflow Internal enterprise product, looks to remake its classic problem-solving forum into a tool for translating human expertise into an AI-accessible format.\nAt its simplest, Stack Overflow Internal is an enterprise version of the web forum, but with the additional security and admin controls you’d expect. The new tools are specifically designed to feed into internal AI agents using the model context protocol, with certain variations designed specifically for Stack Overflow.\nAs CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar tells it, Stack Overflow was already seeing a number of enterprise customers use its API for training, which inspired the new product direction. The company also has content deals with a number of AI labs, allowing them to train models on public Stack Overflow data in exchange for a blanket fee. \nWhile Chandrasekar wouldn’t name specific clients or figures, he described the arrangements as “very similar to the Reddit deals,” which have brought in more than $200 million for that platform.\nA critical part of the new products is a layer of metadata that Stack Overflow exports alongside the question and answer pairs. That data includes basic information like who answered the question and when, as well as content tags and more complex assessments of internal coherence. These factors are then used to create a general reliability score, which informs the AI agent how much each answer can be trusted.\n“The customer can set up their own tagging system or we can dynamically create that for them,” said CTO Jody Bailey. “What we’ll be doing in the future is really leveraging that knowledge graph to connect concepts and pieces of information, rather than requiring the AI systems to do that on their own.”\nWhile Stack Overflow is producing tools for enterprise agents, it isn’t building those agents itself, so it’s difficult to say what the final product will be able to do. But Bailey is particularly excited about the writing function, which would allow agents to create their own Stack Overflow queries if they can’t answer a question or notice a knowledge gap.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs Bailey sees it, that read-write functionality means that, “as we continue to evolve, it will require less and less effort from developers to capture the unique information about the way they operate their business.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nZap Energy took the wraps off its latest fusion device Tuesday at a research meeting in Long Beach, California, the latest in a string of devices the company has built in its quest to bring fusion power to market.\nThe startup is in a race with several other startups that are all attempting to build fusion power plants capable of putting electricity on the grid in the early 2030s.\nZap’s Fuze-3 device has been firing pulses of plasma at the company’s headquarters near Seattle, and the results of those experiments will ultimately inform the design of the company’s future demonstration plants.\nThe Fuze-3 device was able to compress a soup of charged particles — also known as plasma — to more than 232,000 psi (1.6 gigapascals) and heat it to more than 21 million degrees F (11.7 million degrees C).\nA slow-motion look at burning plasma inside Fuze-3.Image Credits:Zap Energy\nThe pressure data marks a record for the type of fusion Zap is pursuing, known as a sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch. Zap’s reactor uses electrodes to send electricity through a plasma, which causes the plasma to generate a magnetic field. If the magnetic field is strong enough, it’ll heat and compress the plasma to the point where particles in the plasma fuse.\nThe figures are useful for Zap as it pursues its goal of commercial fusion power. Although it’s worth noting they’re not directly comparable with other fusion startup’s results since other companies are using different approaches. \nAchieving high-pressure plasmas is vital to any future fusion power plant. In order to generate more power than they consume, fusion reactions must deliver what’s known as the triple product, a figure that describes the temperature, pressure, and duration of a plasma inside a fusion reactor. In other words, get a plasma hot enough and dense enough for long enough, and you’ll be able to generate power.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy Zap’s own calculations, the company still has to increase the pressure of its plasma by at least tenfold before it hits scientific breakeven, a milestone reached by only one other fusion experiment. The company said it is getting close to a key third milestone proposed by Bob Mumgaard, co-founder and CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a Zap competitor.\nZap was able to break the record for plasma pressure by tweaking its reactor design to add a third electrode. In previous designs, two electrodes were able to heat the plasma sufficiently, but the company couldn’t hit the pressure numbers it wanted.\nThe company wouldn’t disclose details of the new design in response to TechCrunch’s questions. But spokesperson Andy Freeborn said it allows the company to use two power banks, giving it more control over how the plasma changes inside the reactor. \n“The plasma chamber itself doesn’t look much different, but it’s operated very differently since there are two pulses of input power rather than one,” he said.\nZap said it is working on a new generation of Fuze device, which it says will come online this winter.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nZoox is starting to open its robotaxis to the public in San Francisco as the Amazon-owned company creeps toward a commercial service and direct competition with Waymo.\nZoox robotaxis — custom-built vehicles that lack a steering wheel or pedals — have been rolling around San Francisco streets for nearly a year. But until now, only Zoox employees and their friends and family have been able to hail a ride.\nThis is not a large-scale public launch, nor a commercial one. Instead, the company will invite some of the people who signed up for the waitlist to join its early rider initiative known as Zoox Explorer. Under that program, those select few will get access to the service and, for now, it’s free.\nRiders will slowly be moved off the waitlist as Zoox adds more robotaxis to its fleet and its service area grows. Zoox said its goal is to remove the waitlist altogether in 2026. The company wouldn’t disclose the number of riders that will be given public access or how many are on the waitlist. Today, it has about 50 robotaxis in Las Vegas and San Francisco.\nOnce given access, riders will be able to use the Zoox app to hail a ride within its service area, which covers the SoMa, Mission, and Design District neighborhoods of San Francisco.\nImage Credits:Zoox\nWhile Zoox’s service area is tiny compared to the 260 square miles that Waymo’s robotaxis operate in, the public launch does get it closer to directly competing with the Alphabet-owned company.  \nZoox, which was acquired by Amazon in 2020, has been working toward a commercial robotaxi service for more than a decade. Its test vehicles, Toyota Highlanders outfitted with sensors and self-driving software were a common sight in the San Francisco Bay Area for years. But it’s the Foster City, California-based company’s purpose-built robotaxis that have captured the public’s attention.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Zoox has been testing our autonomous technology in San Francisco since 2017,” CEO Aicha Evans said in a statement. “It’s our home. A city of innovation and progress, with an amazing mobility ecosystem that we feel Zoox can really complement. We have seen incredible interest in Zoox in this market and are excited about this first step to bring our purpose-built robotaxi experience to more people.”\nTwo hurdles stand between Zoox and a commercial robotaxi service. The company must receive a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates ride-hailing, to be able to charge for rides in the state.\nZoox also has to convince the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to let it use the custom-built robotaxis for a commercial service. \nThe company has made some progress at the federal level. In August, NHTSA gave Zoox an exemption to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. The decision cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, which place requirements on vehicles such as having a steering wheel and pedals. \nThe exemption has allowed Zoox to give free rides in its robotaxis. It won’t be able to charge for rides until NHTSA expands that exemption to cover commercial operations.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nIn 2023, Tayla Cannon moved from Australia to the U.S. for a job in a city she’d never seen before.  \n“No family, no friends, just a fresh start,” she told TechCrunch. A sufferer of chronic back pain,  she first started working in physiotherapy, thinking it was helping make a difference in the lives of others. Yet the traditional physiotherapy model never quite lit a spark in her.  \nShe moved to interventional cardiology but only became more disillusionedwith the physical rehab model with “its localized, reactive, and volume-based nature,” she said.  \nMeanwhile, in her spare time, she became a content creator, sharing her perspective online about “proactive” and “holistic” ways people can get rid of pain.  \nThat took on a life of its own. \nShe now has more than 130,000 followers on Instagram, a company called Athletic Rebuild, which provides rehab and performance coaching for athletes, and now, a platform called Rebuildr, a HIPAA-compliant and mentorship app to help rehab professionals run their own businesses online, set to launch early next year.  \n“I wasn’t trying to build a business; I was just putting my brain on the internet and helping people rethink what care could look like.”  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCannon and her works caught the eye of Slow Ventures, which announced on Tuesday that it invested $1.1 million as a seed round.  She is one of the first creators to receive a check from Slow Ventures’ $60 million Creator Fund, which seeks to back content creators and influencers making an impact online.  \nCannon said she had no plan when she started sharing her thoughts on social media in 2024 and then decided to make this her profession. “There was no strategy, no roadmap, and certainty no business model behind it,” she said. She credits what most content creators do for her success — remaining authentic and sharing unfiltered but genuine thoughts.  \nExpanding a brand on social media is not without challenges, however. Her social media presence, and therefore brand, was growing fast, which was good but also a problem. She was instantly faced with the need to understand business logic, consumer acumen, and content strategy to connect with new audiences. “None of which are taught in healthcare,” she continued. “We’re trained to help people, not to build brands.” \nThe turning point came when she actually realized she was the bottleneck to her own business. “I couldn’t keep scaling something that depended solely on me. I had to build something that could grow without me,” she said, adding that she ended up hiring people to help her with her projects.  \nShe also grew her strategy when she moved from just talking about what’s broken in the world of rehab and started working on solutions to help fix it. Rebuildr is intended to be a “complete shift from localized reactive care to a proactive, holistic mode,” Cannon said, “combining consumer solutions, clinicians, education, and the software to deliver it all at scale.”  \nShe was introduced to the team at Slow Ventures through a friend who invited her to one of the firm’s events in Austin. “I had zero intention of raising capital,” she said. “I wasn’t even pitching. I wasn’t even preparing a deck.”  Still, she connected with Megan Lightcap, an investor at Slow, and told her about what she was building with Rebuildr.  \n“The conversation sparked something,” Cannon said, adding that Slow has helped her “imagine a version of Rebuilder that’s even bigger” than what she envisioned.  \nOthers personal trainer software out there include TrainHeroic, Trainerize, and Everfit. Rudder hopes that her product, Rebuildr, fundamentally reshapes the rehab industry.  \n“I want to make high-quality rehab accessible anywhere in the world, not limited by geography, insurance, or 30-minute appointments,” she said.  \n"

    "body": "\nFollowing a spate of lawsuits and investigations over its child safety systems, Roblox is going to implement mandatory facial verification for all users who want to access communication features, starting in January. The platform is also introducing age-based chat, meaning users can only communicate with others in a similar age group.\nStarting Tuesday, users can voluntarily verify their age to secure their access to communication features. In the first week of December, Roblox will begin enforcing the age-check requirement in select markets, including Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand. From January, all users around the world will be required to verify their age to access chat features.\nThe move comes amid multiple lawsuits, including from the attorneys general of Texas and Louisiana, against Roblox over child safety concerns. The lawsuits were filed following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.\nFor the age-check process, users would have to the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age-check is processed, Roblox says it will delete any images or videos of users. The verification is being processed through a third-party vendor, Persona, which would also delete images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.\nOnce the age-check is complete, users will be informed which age group they have been assigned to. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. \nImage Credits:Roblox\nUsers will be able to chat with others in their own age group and similar age groups as appropriate, Roblox explained during a briefing with reporters on Monday. \nFor example, if someone has an estimated age of 12, they will be assigned to the 9 to 12 age group. They will then be able to chat with users aged 15 and younger. All users aged 16 or older will be prevented from chatting with this user.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We see these changes as a way to help ensure users are able to socialize with others in age groups that are appropriate, but also help limit contact between minors and adults that they do not know,” said Raj Bhatia, Roblox’s VP and head of user and discovery product, during the briefing.\nThe company says the new age-check requirement will provide a more accurate way to verify users’ ages, compared with simply having users enter their birth year when creating an account.\n“We believe that this is something that is first for a company like Roblox in the gaming space and social media and messaging to require explicit age estimation before anybody has access to communication,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox’s chief safety officer, during the briefing.\nRoblox also said it’s launching a new Safety Center that will provide parents and caregivers with guidance and tools, and let them set up Parental Controls.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIntuit has signed a multi-year contract worth more than $100 million with OpenAI, enabling its tax and financial apps to operate within ChatGPT and expanding the company’s use of OpenAI’s models across its products.\nIntuit said its tools, such as TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp, will be accessible through ChatGPT, allowing users to ask questions and complete tasks such as estimating tax refunds, reviewing credit options, or managing business finances.\nWith users’ permission, Intuit’s apps will be able to access their financial data to generate responses and complete tasks, like sending marketing messages or issuing invoice reminders. Customers will also be able to use the tools within ChatGPT to review credit cards, personal loans and mortgages.\nThe agreement reflects a broader trend of technology and financial firms adopting large language models in consumer and business software. OpenAI in October introduced a way to let developers build apps accessible through ChatGPT. Early participants in the program included Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify and several other consumer and productivity platforms.\nBut Intuit’s integration differs from existing ChatGPT apps, as it will be used for tasks that can directly influence financial decisions. Such uses have raised concerns about the reliability of AI systems, which can produce incorrect or misleading outputs. \nIntuit employs multiple validation methods and utilizes large domain-specific datasets to minimize the risk of errors or “hallucinated” responses, Bruce Chan, a spokesperson for Intuit, told TechCrunch.\n“When our AI provides an answer or gives guidance to a customer, it’s drawing on the deep expertise that Intuit has developed over many years, plus the data that gives us a 360-degree view of the customer,” Chan said. “This helps make sure the answer given is relevant and grounded in the customer’s own data, and reflects Intuit’s years of domain expertise.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChan said Intuit continues to stand behind the accuracy guarantees offered through its products, including TurboTax, but did not clarify when asked if the company or the customer would be on the hook for errors that result from AI-generated recommendations or insights.\nIntuit has been expanding its use of AI in recent years with an eye towards taking advantage of its massive data infrastructure. In 2023, the company introduced Intuit Assist, an AI assistant that works across its products.\nThe partnership also involves Intuit expanding its use of OpenAI’s models across its business. The company already uses AI models from OpenAI alongside other commercial and open-source large language models. Intuit said the partnership will give it access to new audiences through ChatGPT, adding another distribution channel for its small-business and consumer finance tools.\n“This partnership will deepen Intuit’s use of OpenAI’s frontier models, which will help power select AI agents across Intuit’s platform,” Chan said.\nThe deal also covers Intuit’s continued use of ChatGPT Enterprise, which the company said is deployed internally to support employee workflows.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIndian edtech startup Physics Wallah ended its first day as a public company on a high, with its shares closing 44% higher than they were listed for, indicating that the country’s edtech sector may still recover after years of gloom.\nPriced at ₹109, the company’s shares climbed as high as ₹161.99 before closing at ₹156.49, valuing it at ₹448 billion (around $5 billion). That’s well above its listing valuation of ₹315 billion (approximately $3.6 billion), and roughly 79% higher than its last private valuation of $2.8 billion in September 2024.\nPhysics Wallah raised ₹34.8 billion (around $393 million) in the IPO. Of this, ₹31 billion (approximately $350.1 million) was through a fresh issue of shares, while ₹3.8 billion (roughly $42.9 million) worth of shares were sold by co-founders Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob, who together held about 80% of the company before the listing.\nThe strong IPO highlights the company’s remarkable growth arc since its humble beginnings as a YouTube channel run by Pandey in 2016. It now stands out in an industry otherwise reeling from layoffs, a funding drought, and the unraveling of once-high-flying rival Byju’s. Today, the company offers test-preparation and upskilling courses via its website, apps and offline centers.\nThe company’s rise comes as its larger rivals struggle to operate. Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup at $22 billion, was engulfed in a corporate-governance crisis, has been fighting legal battles with lenders, and is dealing with a severe cash crunch that has forced mass layoffs. The Bengaluru-based startup is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings in both India and the U.S.\nUnacademy, another high-profile edtech has also sharply scaled back operations and cut staff, and is reported to be in talks to be acquired by upskilling platform UpGrad for $300 to $400 million — a steep decline from its $3.44 billion valuation in 2021.\nIn the financial year 2025, Physics Wallah said its revenue increased 49% to ₹28.9 billion (approximately $326 million) from a year earlier, while its net loss narrowed to ₹2.4 billion (roughly $27.5 million) from ₹11.31 billion (about $127.7 million). Online channels accounted for 48.6% of operating revenue, while offline centers contributed 46.8%. The company also reported a 4.5 million paying subscribers, a 23% increase from last year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s a good milestone to have the IPO coming our way,” said Pandey during the company’s IPO ceremony in Mumbai. “But the mission and vision are a lot to be left to be completed.”\nPhysics Wallah plans to deploy most of its IPO proceeds into expanding its offline centers, strengthening its technology stack, and funding potential acquisitions. The company has already aggressively expanded its offline footprint and currently operates 303 centers across 152 cities in India and the Middle East as of June 2025, up from 182 last year.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn a sea of AI travel-planning apps, a new startup called Boop aims to redefine the space with a new approach: turning social recommendations into bookable itineraries. Instead of getting a random AI-generated travel plan, the app offers users access to itineraries from real people who went on real trips. \nWhen someone takes a trip, Boop uses AI to quickly turn their trip into an itinerary that others can copy and personalize, mainly by looking at location data and metadata from photos they share with the app. The idea is to build a network of shared itineraries that people can monetize, giving travel creators another way to earn money from their recommendations.  \nThe startup was founded in February by Nancy Li Smith, who previously led AR/VR innovation at Meta and Microsoft and served as executive vice president of growth and strategy at physical AI startup BrightAI. \nSmith came up with the idea for Boop after feeling like there wasn’t a way for her to remember or share her own travel recommendations efficiently.  \nShe also wanted to address the stress and emotional labor that often come with planning travel, especially since women make roughly 80% of travel decisions and often feel pressure to make every trip perfect.\n“Women are majority of the time the planner in the in the relationship and in the family and the friends groups,” Smith said during an interview with TechCrunch. “There’s this pressure to make every trip amazing, not only for yourself or your partner, for your family, for your friends. All these years of the emotional and logistical labor for free. Boop is now solving this so that we can capture this easily without people doing anything.”\nInstead of having to scour TikTok for recommendations, sift through hundreds of reviews, and pin ideas across Google Maps, users can access tested and loved itineraries from creators and friends.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Boop\n“Boop is the first AI travel companion that’s built on social trust,” Smith said. “What that means is, the moment you start going on a trip and start exploring and roaming around, Boop basically remembers your trip in the background, so all your stops, your photos, your reservations, and in the background turns this into a beautiful, shoppable itinerary that friends can now actually use.” \nShe continued, “And so how that works is, instead of planning from scratch — which is like a weeks-long process — you can now just copy your friends’ real Tokyo or Paris trip itinerary. And in one tap, you can chat with AI and in minutes be able to personalize it to make it your own.” \nWhen users starts “capturing” a trip, the app tracks their movements in the background, similar to how a fitness app tracks steps or running routes, if the user has given the app permission to do do. The company says Boop’s AI doesn’t use location data for anything other than capturing trips and offering recommendations. For instance, if a user has shared an interest in art and is located in the 11th arrondissement in Paris, Boop may direct them to Atelier des Lumières.\nIn the future, Boop plans to integrate with users calendars, with their permission, in order to access existing reservations and add them to their itineraries.\nSmith says Boop is helpful when you’re on the road, too, not just when planning a trip. For example, if you’re standing in the middle of Tokyo at 11 pm feeling spontaneous, Boop can recommend something for you to do based on your taste and your friends’ recommendations.\nBoop is launching on Tuesday on mobile and is currently available on an invite-only basis. The company currently has a public waitlist that users can join.\nBoop is offering early access to select travel creators whose trips people already want to copy, Smith says. The startup has seen interest from creators who already share their travels and are looking for a way to earn from their recommendations. Creators can share their trips with followers through a “Boop with me” link that includes affiliate links. \nImage Credits:Boop\n“When people copy the link and book, we automatically integrate affiliate commission APIs from the industry, and we generate the industry standard of 10 to 25% commissions, and we turn half of that back to the creators,” Smith said. “With each copy, that means 50 to 100 bucks. And if you’re an influencer with 100,000 followers, and you have 100 people copying this, it becomes a five [or] six figure income down the road.” \nBoop is working with hotel and experience affiliate aggregation companies and using APIs to access affiliate booking inventory from platforms such as Expedia, Booking.com, Marriott, and Viator. \nSmith says Boop is fortunate to be backed by leaders from TripAdvisor, Marriott, and Expedia, noting that they understand travel and consumer behavior. Notable investors include Stephen Kaufer, co‑founder and former CEO of Tripadvisor, and Stephanie Linnartz, the former president of Marriott International. \nIn terms of funding, Boop raised $3.2 million in pre-seed funding in May, co-led by Bling Capital and BBG Ventures.\nAs for the future, Boop wants to be the go-to place for booking travel, especially as research shows that Gen Zs are less likely to view travel as a discretionary expense.\n“In five years, what we the team internally talked about is when someone wants to plan a trip, they won’t say, check the reviews, they’ll say, copy my Boop,” Smith said. “And, so every real trip becomes a guide, and every memory becomes a new currency.” \n"

The deal will give Microsoft access to compute infrastructure built with Nvidia’s GB300 GPUs, which will be deployed over phases through 2026 at IREN’s facility in Childress, Texas, planned to support 750 megawatts of capacity.\nIREN said it is separately buying GPUs and equipment from Dell for about $5.8 billion.\nThe deal comes after Microsoft last month launched its first production cluster with Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 systems for Azure, which, the company said, are optimized for reasoning models, agentic AI systems, and multimodal generative AI.\nLast month, Microsoft signed a deal with Nscale for approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.\nSimilar to competitors like CoreWeave, IREN started off as a bitcoin-mining operation but quickly realized that its massive collection of GPUs was better put to use for AI workloads. The company has benefited massively from the shift in focus. The company’s CEO, Daniel Roberts, expects the Microsoft deal to take up only 10% of the company’s total capacity and generate about $1.94 billion in annualized revenue, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

The company has announced new data center buildouts with Oracle, SoftBank, the United Arab Emirates, and others. OpenAI has also secured deals with chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom.\nTo some analysts, the increased investment form OpenAI and other tech giants signals that the industry is heading toward an AI bubble, wherein massive sums are spent beefing out an unproven, and potentially dangerous, technology with no clear sign of a meaningful return on investment.  \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

The company said that past content will remain private after the conversion, and member lists will remain protected.\nOften, admins start their groups as private, thinking they will remain small, but then realize they could reach a much broader audience if they were easier to find. This update will allow Facebook Groups to expand their reach without having to start a public group from scratch or exposing their members’ past posts.\nAccording to Meta, the change to the group’s privacy can be made from the settings page on Facebook. When an admin changes the private group’s status to public, all other admins are notified of the change and have a three-day window to review and cancel the conversion if not everyone agrees.\nImage Credits:Meta/Facebook\nAfter the update, all past group content — including posts, comments, and reactions — will only be visible to members who were in the group before the conversion, as well as to admins and moderators. Member lists are also protected and only visible to admins and moderators.\nMembers are also notified about the change and will be reminded again when they post or comment for the first time in the newly public group.\nAfter the conversion to public, new posts, comments, and reactions will be visible to anyone, including those who aren’t on Facebook, as with any other public group. This could also help Facebook’s content be more easily indexed by search engines like Google, which can then surface these groups in their search results for related queries.\nIf the admins decide that being a public group isn’t the right call, they can revert the group to private again.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n"

    "body": "\nU.S. prosecutors have charged two rogue employees of a cybersecurity company that specializes in negotiating ransom payments to hackers on behalf of their victims, with carrying out ransomware attacks of their own.\nLast month, the Department of Justice indicted Kevin Tyler Martin and another unnamed employee, who both worked as ransomware negotiators at DigitalMint, with three counts of computer hacking and extortion related to a series of attempted ransomware attacks against at least five U.S.-based companies.\nProsecutors also charged a third individual, Ryan Clifford Goldberg, a former incident response manager at cybersecurity giant Sygnia, as part of the scheme.\nThe three are accused of hacking into companies, stealing their sensitive data, and deploying ransomware developed by the ALPHV/BlackCat group.\nThe ALPHV/BlackCat gang operates as a ransomware-as-a-service model, in which the gang develops the file-encrypting malware used to steal and scramble the victims’ data, while its affiliates — such as the three individuals indicted — carry out the hacks and deploy the gang’s ransomware. The gang then takes a cut of the profits made from any ransom payments.\nAccording to an FBI affidavit filed in September, the rogue employees received more than $1.2 million in ransom payments from one victim, a medical device maker in Florida. They also targeted several other companies, including a Virginia-based drone maker and a Maryland-headquartered pharmaceutical company. \nThe Chicago Sun-Times first reported the indictment on Sunday.\nSygnia chief executive Guy Segal confirmed to TechCrunch that Goldberg was a Sygnia employee and was terminated after Sygnia learned of his alleged involvement with the ransomware attacks. The company declined to comment further citing the FBI’s ongoing investigation.\nDigitalMint president Marc Grens told TechCrunch that Martin was an employee at the time of the alleged hacks, but said Martin was “acting completely outside the scope of his employment.” \nGrens also confirmed that the unnamed individual may be a former employee. DigitalMint is also cooperating with the government’s investigation, said Grens. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo said Monday it will launch a robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego as the Alphabet-owned company hits the accelerator on its expansion plans. \nThe announcement illustrates Waymo’s recent evolution from autonomous vehicle technology developer to commercial enterprise. It also follows comments by Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana, who said last week during TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that it is imperative the company scales.\n“By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,” Mawakana said at the time. \nWaymo completed more than 250,000 rides per week as of April. The company has since added more, although the company has not shared a specific number.\nWaymo tested its technology for years in Silicon Valley before launching a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix, followed by the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles. In the past year, the company has brought its robotaxis to Atlanta and Austin in partnership with Uber. Waymo has also announced plans to expand its commercial business to several new markets in 2026, including Denver, Miami, Nashville, London, Seattle, and Washington DC.\nWaymo said Monday it plans to roll out a mix of self-driving Jaguar I-Pace and Zeekr RT vehicles to the three markets this week. The public won’t have access right away, however. \nWaymo’s go-to-market strategy typically begins with human drivers manually operating the vehicles to map  city streets. The human safety operator is eventually removed and the autonomous vehicles, which are equipped with cameras, radar, and lidar sensors as well as self-driving software, navigate on their own. After a period of driverless testing, Waymo offers access to employees, media, and some consumers before eventually opening up the robotaxi service to the public.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLas Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley said in a statement that the “introduction of Waymo and its autonomous driving technology is not a science experiment, but rather a proven, safe, new alternative designed to help our residents and the millions of visitors who come to our city get around — from the Strip and beyond.” Berkley added that the city is committed to ensuring this technology is adopted responsibly.\nWaymo is already familiar with these three cities. The company has brought its autonomous vehicles to Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego before. Waymo also has an engineering team based in the Detroit area. The company says it is prepared for the snowy conditions in Detroit after spending multiple seasons driving across the metro Detroit area and the Upper Peninsula to expand its winter weather capabilities.\nWaymo noted that its rapid expansion is thanks to the generalized approach of its self-driving system. That growth has helped make Waymo the dominant player in the robotaxi market. However, there are other companies also making a play for market share. \nZoox operates a free robotaxi service in Las Vegas, a city where it has tested and developed its tech for years. Tesla also has a robotaxi service, which still has humans in the passenger seat, in parts of Austin as well.   \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

Unlike Instagram, however, TikTok is taking a more traditional approach to its awards, as it’s hosting an actual awards show where winners will be revealed live at the event. The event will feature a red carpet, live performances, and a live audience of hundreds of creators, TikTok says.\nThe awards show will take place on December 18 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles and will be livestreamed on the TikTok app and on Tubi. The show will be available to stream on demand on Tubi the following day.\nUsers will be able to vote for their favorite creators on a new portal on TikTok launching on November 18. \nIt’s worth noting that although this is TikTok’s first awards show in the U.S., it has held similar events in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, Korea, and more in the past.\nThe nominees for “Creator of the Year” are adamw, alixearle. brookemonk_, keith_lee125, and kristy.sarah. The nominees for “Breakthrough Artist of the Year” are alexwarren, katseyeworld, laufey, ravynlenae, and sombr.\nOther awards categories include “Storyteller of the Year,” “TikTok for Good Award,” “MVP of the Year,” “Okay Slay Award,” “TikTok LIVE Creators of the Year,” and more.\nThe full list of awards and nominees can be found on TikTok’s announcement post.\nBy launching an awards show, TikTok is positioning itself as more than just a social media app and more of a notable force in the entertainment industry. Given that TikTok serves as a launching pad for several emerging artists and actors, it makes sense for the company to celebrate its top users with its own branded show.\n“The trophies presented on stage will beam a colorful glow upon the creators defining this new era of culture encompassing many areas, including fashion, beauty, sports, TV and film, and new forms of entertainment,” TikTok wrote in the announcement post.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle says it has removed Gemma from its AI Studio after a U.S. senator accused the AI model of fabricating accusations of sexual misconduct against her.\nIn a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senator Marsha Blackburn — a Republican from Tennessee — said that when Gemma was asked, “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” it responded by falsely claiming that during a 1987 state senate campaign, a state trooper alleged that Blackburn “pressured him to obtain prescription drugs for her and that the relationship involved non-consensual acts.”\n“None of this is true, not even the campaign year which was actually 1998,” Blackburn wrote. While there are links to news articles that supposedly support these claims, she said, “The links lead to error pages and unrelated news articles. There has never been such an accusation, there is no such individual, and there are no such news stories.”\nThe letter also said that during a recent Senate Commerce hearing, Blackburn brought up conservative activist Robby Starbuck’s lawsuit against Google, in which Starbuck claims Google’s AI models (including Gemma) generated defamatory claims about him being a “child rapist” and “serial sexual abuser.”\nAs recounted in Blackburn’s letter, Google’s Vice President for Government Affairs and Public Policy Markham Erickson responded that hallucinations are a known issue and Google is “working hard to mitigate them.”\nBlackburn’s letter argued that on the contrary, Gemma’s fabrications are “not a harmless ‘hallucination,’” but rather “an act of defamation produced and distributed by a Google-owned AI model.”\nPresident Donald Trump’s tech industry supporters have complained that “AI censorship” causes popular chatbots to show a liberal bias, and Trump even signed an executive order banning “woke AI” earlier this year. Blackburn — who helped to strip a moratorium on state-level AI regulation from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — echoed those complaints in her letter, writing that there’s “a consistent pattern of bias against conservative figures demonstrated by Google’s AI systems.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a Friday night post on X, Google did not reference the specifics of Blackburn’s letter, but the company said it’s “seen reports of non-developers trying to use Gemma in AI Studio and ask it factual questions.”\n“We never intended this to be a consumer tool or model, or to be used this way,” the company said. (Google promotes Gemma as a family of open, lightweight models that developers can integrate into their own products, while AI Studio is the company’s web-based development environment for AI-powered apps.)\nAs a result, Google said it’s removing Gemma from AI Studio while continuing to make the models available via API.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment.\nThis post has been edited to remove inaccurate language about Senator Blackburn’s support of Trump administration policies.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

The latest exchange began when Altman posted what he called “a tale in three acts,” with screenshots showing that he reserved a Tesla Roadster in 2018, then recently tried to cancel it and request a refund on his $50,000 reservation fee, only for his email to bounce.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nThe second-generation Roadster sports car was first announced in November 2017 but has been repeatedly pushed back, with Musk (Tesla’s CEO) recently saying that a new version will be unveiled by the end of this year.\nMusk first responded to Altman’s post by writing, “You stole a nonprofit,” a criticism that he’s directed at Altman and OpenAI before — not just in tweets, but also with lawsuits and takeover bids seeking to stymie OpenAI’s attempts to restructure as a for-profit company (a process that OpenAI recently completed, with its non-profit arm still retaining control over the for-profit public benefit corporation).\nMusk even started a rival AI startup, xAI, which is suing OpenAI and Apple over allegations that the two companies are colluding to stifle competition. (Altman said the accusation is “remarkable … given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.”)\nIn addition to repeating his criticism of Altman and OpenAI, Musk also suggested today that Altman’s screenshots didn’t tell the full story.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nThe AI web browser Dia is drawing inspiration from its predecessor, Arc, an earlier experiment in modernizing the web-browsing experience that hailed from the startup known as The Browser Company. On Sunday, The Browser Company’s founder, Josh Miller, confirmed that the new AI browser will bring “Arc’s greatest hits” to Dia, including things like the sidebar mode, and combine that with AI-native features like memory and agents.\nThis explanation suggests that Dia, which has since been acquired by Atlassian for $610 million, could have an advantage in the AI browser race, as it builds on the company’s earlier learnings from developing Arc.\nThe latter was initially released in mid-2023 as a reinvention of the browser designed around the way people use the internet today. That included offering separate workspaces for work and personal browsing, support for pinned tabs, a Command Bar that worked like Apple’s Spotlight search, and a sidebar that included the search bar, tab list, user bookmarks, audio controls, and more. \n\nTbh we (or i really) duffed the comms in a bunch of ways, but…1. Dia's architecture is much better for AI, speed, security2. We're adapting Arc's greatest hits to be native to Dia3. Sidebar mode for Arc fansDia + Arc = snappier, smarter, simpler by default w/ Pro mode— Josh Miller (@joshm) November 3, 2025\n\nHowever, Arc may have tried to push the envelope a bit too far: Miller later admitted that Arc was ultimately too complex for most people to adopt.\n“Arc was simply too different, with too many new things to learn, for too little reward … On top of that, Arc lacked cohesion in both its core features and core values. It was experimental — that was part of its charm — but also its complexity,” Miller wrote in a blog post earlier this year, detailing the company’s decision to wind down Arc and open source it, and refocusing the company’s efforts on building Dia.\nBut Arc may not necessarily be a failure, even if it didn’t become a widely adopted consumer product. Instead, the browser gave the company over a year’s worth of insights into what sort of modern browser features resonate with users and which ones do not.\nThat could help the company get ahead when building out the feature set for Dia.\nAs Miller says in a post on X, “Dia’s architecture is much better for AI, speed, and security,” but it will introduce features that Arc fans loved, like the sidebar mode — which was just spotted in the company’s latest “early birds” release of Dia’s AI browser.\n\nI'm daily-driving @diabrowser as a years-long Arc user and now an Early Bird, and I can say I'm so close to not miss Arc.Dia browser now has:– Focus mode– Vertical tabs– Pinned tabs (grid-view)– Google Meet PIP And I now wait for only three things before deleting Arc-… pic.twitter.com/qo9RSUUNmV— BLCNYY (@BLCNYY) November 1, 2025\n\nAlready, Dia has added other features from Arc’s “greatest hits,” like turning Google Meet into a picture-in-picture player automatically when you switch tabs and custom keyboard shortcuts. Miller hinted that the company is exploring how to transition Arc’s Spaces — the distinct browsing areas with their own set of pinned tabs, favorites, themes, history, and cookies — to Dia. And he said Dia’s team is currently testing pinned tabs.\nMiller additionally solicited feedback about other features to add, like swipeable profiles and Arc Search-inspired updates for the Dia mobile app coming in 2026.\nPlus, Miller notes, Dia will have less bloat and will be AI native for things like memory and agents.\nFollowing the acquisition by Atlassian, The Browser Company continues to operate independently. As a result, Miller said the company will be able to add more “browser basics,” referring to favorite Arc features, to the Dia browser. He also shared that Dia is developing deeper integrations with Atlassian’s Jira and other apps, like Linear, under its new owner.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nPine Labs, an Indian merchant-commerce startup backed by PayPal and Mastercard, is going public this week at a valuation about 40% lower than its last private round — even as it doubles down on plans to take its fintech platform global.\nThe Gurugram-based fintech has set a price band of ₹210–₹221 (about $2.00–$2.50) a share, valuing the company at approximately ₹254 billion (around $2.9 billion) at the upper end of the range. This represents a decline of about 40% from its last private valuation of over $5 billion in 2022.\nPine Labs has also reduced its primary offering by 20% to ₹20.8 billion (approximately $234 million) from ₹26 billion in its draft prospectus filed in June, while the offer for sale has been cut by 44% to 82.3 million shares from 148 million shares planned earlier.\nExisting investors, including Peak XV Partners, Temasek Holdings, PayPal, and Mastercard, are among those selling part of their holdings in the offering.\nPine Labs CEO Amrish Rau told reporters at a press briefing on Monday that investors had chosen to retain a larger portion of their shareholdings, which resulted in a smaller offer for sale.\n“When it came to the pricing of this IPO, we were very clear that we want to continue to garner goodwill, and we wanted to get everybody’s support when we go out with this pricing for this IPO,” he said. “We believe we were able to maintain that because, at the end of the day, it takes a village to come together to create a successful IPO.”\nFounded in 1998, Pine Labs initially focused on deploying point-of-sale terminals for merchants but has since evolved beyond payment acceptance to enable bill payments through platforms such as Amazon Pay and CRED, and to facilitate account-aggregator-based transactions, among a broader suite of payment, transaction, and acquiring services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCurrently, about 70% of Pine Labs’ revenue comes from its digital infrastructure and transaction services, while the remaining 30% is generated from its issuing and acquiring businesses, Rau said.\nPine Labs is among the few Indian startups that already serve customers outside the country and is seeking to expand its international presence following its planned listing on Indian stock exchanges. This aligns with the Indian government’s broader push to build globally competitive fintech offerings. The company is also part of a growing group of technology firms that have relocated their headquarters to India to tap into the country’s large base of retail investors and to align more closely with local regulatory frameworks.\nThe firm currently serves over 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, powering more than 6 billion transactions cumulatively valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (around $128 billion). It already operates in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Africa, the UAE, and the U.S.\nBetween the financial years 2023 and 2025, Pine Labs’ revenue from international markets grew by nearly 58%, Rau said.\n“What we have done in fintech in India, no other country has been able to do anything close to that,” he told reporters. “We have the opportunity to take this IP knowledge, the technology stack that we have developed, and make it global. We have been the first companies which has actually done that, and we believe that our fintech stack is very, very much in demand in global markets, and that’s why we are winning these clients in these international markets.”\nIn India, Pine Labs competes with the likes of Razorpay, Paytm, and Walmart-owned PhonePe. The company turned profitable in the June quarter, posting a net profit of ₹47.86 million (about $540,000), compared with a loss of ₹278.89 million a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 17.9% year-over-year to ₹6.16 billion (around $69 million) in the quarter. The firm’s overseas business contributed about 15% of total revenue, amounting to ₹943.25 million (roughly $11 million), up from ₹795.97 million a year earlier.\nPine Labs’ listing comes amid a wave of Indian technology companies preparing to go public, including Groww, Lenskart, Shadowfax, Meesho, and BoAt, all of which are expected to launch their offerings this year.\n"

    "body": "\nMicrosoft will invest $15.2 billion in the United Arab Emirates over the next four years, the company announced Monday at the first annual Abu Dhabi Global AI Summit. The investment will include the first-ever shipments of the most advanced Nvidia GPUs to the UAE.\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. has granted Microsoft a license to export Nvidia chips to the UAE, a move that positions the country as both a proving ground for U.S. export-control diplomacy and a regional anchor of American AI influence.\nThe deal allows Microsoft to expand its foothold into the Middle East, a key region in the global fight for AI dominance. In May, President Donald Trump struck a deal with UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to build an AI data center campus in Abu Dhabi. The project was delayed due to U.S. export controls, which restricted the sale of powerful Nvidia chips needed to run advanced AI systems.\nMicrosoft became the first company to receive a license from the U.S. Commerce Department to ship the chips to the UAE in September. The move comes as critics say the deal undermines the logic of the U.S.’s export restrictions to China by introducing possible back channels through a Chinese ally. \nIn a statement, Microsoft said it performed substantial work to meet the strong cybersecurity and national security conditions required by the licenses, which has enabled the firm to accumulate the equivalent of 21,500 Nvidia A100 GPUs in the UAE, based on a combination of A100, H100, and H200 chips.  \nMicrosoft said it is using the chips to provide access to AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open source providers, and itself. \nThe $15.2 billion figure includes money Microsoft began spending in the UAE starting in 2023 as part of a new AI initiative in the country. Between 2023 and the end of 2025, Microsoft will have spent just over $7.3 billion in the UAE, including a $1.5 billion equity investment in G42, the UAE’s sovereign AI company, and more than $4.6 billion in capital toward data centers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs part of the new deal, Microsoft pledges to spend $7.9 billion more in the UAE from the start of 2026 to the end of 2029, including $5.5 billion in capital expenses for ongoing and planned expansion of AI and cloud infrastructure. Microsoft hinted at new steps it will share publicly in Abu Dhabi this week.\nMicrosoft’s work in the UAE goes beyond building data centers. The company says it is pairing massive AI infrastructure with deep investment in local talent, training, and governance. The firm is pledging to train a million residents by 2027 and use Abu Dhabi as a regional hub for AI research and model development.  \nThe investment comes the same day that Microsoft signed a $9.7 billion deal with Australia’s IREN for AI cloud capacity.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that the company is doing “well more” than $13 billion in annual revenue — and he sounded a little testy when pressed on how it will pay for its massive spending commitments.\nHis comments came up during a joint interview on the Bg2 podcast between Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the partnership between their companies. Host Brad Gerstner (who’s also founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital) brought up reports that OPenAI is currently bringing in around $13 billion in revenue — a sizable amount, but one that’s dwarfed by more than $1 trillion in spending commitments for computing infrastructure that OpenAI has made for the next decade.\n“First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman said, prompting laughs from Nadella. “I just — enough. I think there are a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares.”\n“Including myself,” Gerstner interjected.\nAltman then added that there are critics who “talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy our shares.”\nIn fact, he said that although there are “not many times” when he wants OpenAI to be a public company, “One of the rare times it’s appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous ‘OpenAI is about to go out of business’ [posts], I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.”\nAltman acknowledged that there are ways the company “might screw it up” — for example by failing to get access to enough computing resources — but he said that “revenue is growing steeply.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We are taking a forward bet that it will continue to grow, and that not only will ChatGPT keep growing, but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds, that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing, that AI that can automate science will create huge value,” he added.\nNadella also claimed that OpenAI has “beaten” every business plan that it’s given Microsoft as an investor.\nGerstner returned to the subject of OpenAI’s revenues and IPO plans later in the interview, when he speculated about the company reaching $100 billion in revenue in 2028 or 2029.\n“How about ‘27?” Altman countered.\nAt the same time, he denied reports that OpenAI plans to go public next year.\n“No no no, we don’t have anything that specific,” Altman said. “I’m a realist, I assume it will happen someday, but I don’t know why people write these reports. We don’t have a date in mind, we don’t have a board decision to do this or anything like that. I just assume it’s where things will eventually go.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nIn the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years.  \nThose figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they’re starting to make Wall Street nervous. \nThe issue came to a head this week as Meta reported quarterly earnings, which showed the company’s operating expenses jumping $7 billion year-over-year and nearly $20 billion in capital expense. It was the result of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, which has yet to bring in meaningful revenue for the company. When analysts pressed for more specifics, Mark Zuckerberg made it clear the spending was just getting started. \n“The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the call. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.” \nIf his goal was to reassure investors, it didn’t work. By the end of the call, Meta’s share price had plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta’s stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday, representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap. \nIt’s dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta’s quarterly earnings weren’t that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta’s aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line. Even more alarming was that, aside from a lot of enormous data centers and well-compensated AI researchers, it wasn’t clear what the money actually bought.  \nAnalysts pressed Zuckerberg on why he was spending so much on AI, and when they could expect to see revenue from the growing spending. But the call came at an odd spot in Meta’s planning, with no clear budget for projected spending and no available product that could anchor a revenue forecast. As a result, Zuckerberg was left with only general claims about the promise of AI.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we’re starting to see that,” he asid during the call. “And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business A … the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the Family of Apps and improve the recommendations in advertising.” \nMeta isn’t the only company spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, so it’s worth teasing out why this same spending isn’t spooking investors at Google or Nvidia, both of which had a great quarter. OpenAI is the biggest offender, spending the same amount with far less financial cushion than Meta.  \nThere really are concerns that we’re creating a bubble, and if we are, Meta’s core business will let it ride things out better than most. \nBut if you ask Sam Altman why he’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars on compute, he’ll tell you he’s operating one of the fastest growing consumer services in human history — and one bringing in $20 billion a year in revenue. We can argue about how sustainable the growth rate is (that’s a separate blog post), but there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions. \nMeta doesn’t have a product like that, and it’s not clear where it’s going to come from.  \nThe company’s most powerful AI product is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted on the call has more than a billion active users. But those numbers are surely juiced by the three billion active users on Facebook and Instagram, and it’s hard to see the current version of Meta AI as a competitor to ChatGPT. There’s also the Vibes video generator, which really did boost daily active users, but has limited business impact beyond that.  \nThe most ambitious project is the Vanguard smart glasses released earlier this month. However, the glasses feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of LLMs.  \nPut simply, these are promising experiments, not fully formed products. \nIt’s telling then that when he was pressed on infrastructure spending, Zuckerberg’s response wasn’t to point to the recent launches, but to focus on the next generation. \nZuckerberg stressed, while emphasizing the pending impact of the Superintelligence Lab’s new models, that he was very excited about new products.  \n“It’s not just Meta AI as an assistant,” he said. “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it.”  \nBut this was an earnings call, not a product launch, so all he could say was that there would be more to share “in the coming months.” \nAs the market response showed that answer is wearing thin.  \nTo be fair, it’s only been four months since Zuckerberg restructured his company’s AI team, and the new Superintelligence team hasn’t had time to launch an earthshaking AI product yet. But as the company spends billions of dollars to stay competitive in AI, there’s still no clear indication of what role Zuckerberg wants to play in the new industry.  \nWill Meta AI use the company’s detailed store of personal data to grow into a ChatGPT competitor? Is Vibes the first step in a consumer entertainment play, building off Meta’s targeted ad system? Or maybe Zuckerberg’s references to “business AI” are hints at a more detailed enterprise play? \nSo far, it’s anyone’s guess. Whatever the answer, the pressure is on Meta to find it — and soon. \n"

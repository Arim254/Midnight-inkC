Amazon will begin a closed beta program in March, inviting industry partners to try out its AI tools.\nAmazon said it anticipates sharing initial outcomes from the program by May. The company chose not to provide further details on the developments when approached by TechCrunch for a comment.\nThe AI Studio is collaborating with notable producers like Robert Stromberg, known for “Maleficent,” Kunal Nayyar from “The Big Bang Theory,” and former animator Colin Brady from Pixar to learn the best way to implement these tools. Amazon is also tapping Amazon Web Services for support and intends to work with several LLM providers.\nAlbert Cheng, who heads the AI Studios initiative, emphasized that the goal is to support creative teams, not to replace them. The focus is on improving efficiency and reducing costs while ensuring that intellectual property is protected and AI-generated content isn’t absorbed into other AI models. One example used is Amazon’s “House of David” series, which featured 350 AI-generated shots in season two. \n​However, the rise of adoption of AI in Hollywood has stirred up plenty of debate. Many people in the industry worry about what it means for jobs, creativity, and the future of filmmaking. \nThe conversations around AI are only getting louder as more companies experiment with these new tools. For instance, Netflix has also jumped on the AI bandwagon, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealing that its series “The Eternaut” used generative AI to create a building collapse scene.\nIn recent years, Amazon has cited its success with AI as a factor in layoffs. The company recently eliminated 16,000 jobs in January, following 14,000 layoffs last October.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

    "body": "\nGoogle’s AI chatbot Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings. This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.\nLast quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has reported nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.\nThe recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance. \nCEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.\nGoogle recently rolled out a more affordable plan, the Google AI Plus, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.\n“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors. \nGemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called Ironwood, to compete with Nvidia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,” Pichai stated in today’s release.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Tetra Images / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2:27 PM PST · February 4, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe Internet Archive is a nonprofit that — as you might expect — is devoted to archiving the internet and preserving digital context for future generations. This week, the platform announced a new tool designed to expand on that mission by helping the world’s WordPress users keep their articles in peak digital health.\nThe Archive’s Wayback Machine, which indexes the web through widespread snapshotting, has partnered with Automattic, the company behind WordPress. Together, the two organizations have launched a new WordPress plug-in — the Link Fixer — that is designed to combat the scourge of “link rot.”\n“Link rot” is the unfortunate phenomenon whereby online articles become populated by broken links — URLs that once led to active pages but now result in error messages or dead ends. A Pew Research study from 2024 showed that nearly 40% of links that existed in 2013 were no longer active. Such “digital decay” occurs across a broad diversity of web pages, from news and government sites to Wikipedia pages to tweets.\nAutomattic says that its new plug-in works by scanning your WordPress posts for outbound links, then cross-referencing the Wayback Machine for archived versions of those links. If there are none, it will automatically take new snapshots of the articles in question. Should a linked web page go offline, the new feature will then redirect readers to the archived versions, so that there is no drop in service. The tool also archives a user’s own posts, helping to ensure their longevity.\nThe tool is designed to keep a site’s visitors reading the best available version of a web page. Indeed, Automattic’s plug-in perpetually checks a web page’s links, and if an original link that had gone offline is resurrected, the plug-in will start redirecting the user to that original page again instead of the archived version.\nA write-up on Github shows that the plug-in’s controls are relatively easy to maneuver and offer convenient customization. For instance, users can specify how often they want the plug-in to scan a link for validity (the default offered by the program is every three days).\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nAlphabet declined to answer one of its investors during questions about Google’s AI deal with Apple on Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings call. Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.\nThat decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI. \nOver the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker $20 billion to be the default search engine on Apple devices, filings from the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple’s massive customer base — the iPhone maker last quarter announced it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.\nThe latest Apple AI deal is rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn’t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers’ websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google’s search business, are still an “experiment” for now.\nThe company first announced last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads’ placement below or integrated into the chatbot’s responses. Google is also trying out agentic shopping, including Shop with AI Mode, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface. \nMeanwhile, Google’s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with its forthcoming Super Bowl ad, which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.\nHow this will all play out longer-term is still an open question — and for today, an unanswered one, apparently. \nOverall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet’s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple’s “preferred cloud provider” and would be helping to develop “the next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.” Google’s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nVoice AI company ElevenLabs said today it raised $500 million in a new funding round led by Sequoia Capital, which was an investor in the startup’s last secondary round through a tender. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board.\nThe startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in its last round in January 2025. Earlier in the year, the Financial Times reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation.\nThe company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it. Some prior investors, like BroadLight, NFDG, Valor Capital, AMP Coalition, and Smash Capital, also joined the round. New investors for the funding included Lightspeed Venture Partners, EvanticCapital, and Bond.\nElevenLabs said that it will disclose some investors later in February, which might be strategic partners. The company has raised over $781 million to date. It said that it will use the funding for research and product development, along with expansion in international markets like India, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and Mexico. \nThe company’s co-founder, Mati Staniszewski, indicated that ElevenLabs might work on agents beyond voice and incorporate video. In January, the company announced a partnership with LTX to produce audio-to-video content.\n“The intersection of models and products is critical – and our team has proven, time and again, how to translate research into real-world experiences. This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether. We plan to expand our Creative offering – helping creators combine our best-in-class audio with video and Agents – enabling businesses to build agents that can talk, type, and take action,” he said in a statement.\nThe company has seen good growth momentum as it closed the year at $330 million ARR. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, Staniszewski said that it took ElevenLabs five months to reach $200 million to $300 million in ARR.\nVoice AI model providers are an attractive target for investors and big tech companies. In January, rival Deepgram raised $130 million from AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.

    "body": "\nLast year, Roblox launched an open source AI model that could generate 3D objects on the platform, helping users quickly design digital items such as furniture, vehicles, and accessories. The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March.\nOn Wednesday, the company launched the open beta for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in early access since November. \nRoblox says 4D creation adds an important new layer: interactivity. With this technology, users can design items that can move and react to players in the game.\nImage Credits:Roblox\n​At launch, there are two types of object templates (called schemas) that creators can try out. \nThe first is the “Car-5” schema, which is used to create a car made of five separate parts: the main body and four wheels. Previously, cars were a single, solid 3D object that couldn’t move. The new system breaks down objects into parts and assigns behaviors to each so that they function individually within the virtual world. The AI therefore can generate cars with spinning wheels, making them more realistic and interactive. ​\nThe second is called “Body-1,” which can generate any object made from a single piece, like a simple box or sculpture.\nThe first experience with 4D generation is a game called Wish Master, where players can generate cars they can drive, planes they can fly, and even dragons.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​In the future, Roblox plans to let creators make their own schemas so they’ll have more freedom to define how objects behave. The company says it is also developing new technology that could use a reference image to create a detailed 3D model that matches the image’s style (example below).\nImage Credits:Roblox\nThe company says it is developing more ways to help people create games and experiences using AI, including a project it has dubbed “real-time dreaming.” Roblox CEO David Baszucki last month explained that this project would let creators build new worlds using “keyboard navigation and sharing real-time text prompts.”\nThe open beta comes on the heels of Roblox’s recent implementation of mandatory facial verification for users to access chat features in the game, following lawsuits and investigations related to child safety.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSNAK Venture Partners announced Wednesday the close of its oversubscribed $50 million debut fund, anchored by the investment firm Pritzker Group (founded by Illinois governor JB Pritzker and his brother, Tony).\nSNAK founders Sonia Nagar and Adam Koopersmith worked at the firm and helped lead investments in companies like the auto marketplace Backlot Cars and TicketsNow (exited to Ticketmaster). The duo decided to break out on their own and, earlier this year, launched their firm to back digital marketplaces. \n“It felt like the timing was right and there was support within the firm to go do this,” Nagar said. \nThe vision is that there is still so much to digitize, like in supply chain and construction, and this is the moment to strike because even holdout industries are more comfortable adopting new technology as fintech architecture advances. \n“If you look at the biggest venture wins over the last decade,” she said, pointing to the likes of Uber, Instacart, and Airbnb, “those are five of the top 10 outcomes in venture.” As in those companies that raised billions from investors, went on to IPO, and returned millions to them.\n“Most of those wins were in consumer, which tends to be faster-moving than large enterprises,” Nagar continued. “We think there’s a ton of white space to double down and focus on B2B marketplaces.” Looking specifically for the categories that haven’t yet digitized. \nThe firm has already invested in six companies, including Big Rentals and Repackify, focused on equipment rental and packaging logistics, respectively. Nagar said the firm hopes to overall write seed checks into at least 20 companies, at $1 million to $2 million a pop. She said they hope to deploy the entire fund within the next 3 to 4 years. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThough many new funds are struggling to raise capital (and capital remains concentrated at the top), Nagar said she and Koopersmith were able to lean on their backgrounds when wooing LPs. \nNagar previously helped launch Amazon apparel back in 2009, and was head of mobile at RetailMeNot. Koopersmith, meanwhile, spent 20 years at Pritzker Group and serves on the board of various marketplace companies. At the same time, Nagar said that without Pritzker’s support, it would have been quite hard to raise this fund, especially in last year’s environment.\nOther LPs in their fund include the State of Illinois Growth and Innovation Fund and executives from other marketplace companies, like Favor Delivery and RetailMeNot. \nNagar said the firm is also location-agnostic, recognizing that the still-hidden marketplaces may not be found only in Silicon Valley and New York City. “We’re finding these overlooked founders in places where maybe other funds aren’t looking,” she said. \nSNAK is itself based in Chicago, which she said some LPs have questioned. “People perceive that as a disadvantage; we view it as an advantage,” she continued. “We can get to everybody very fast.” \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSnap is on a mission to diversify its revenue sources — moving from a business model in which it largely chases ad revenue to one where it can also make money through subscriptions and, eventually, hardware. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.\nIn Q4, Snap’s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.\nThe company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform launched back in 2022. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.\nWhile those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.\nReuters also reports that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.\nDuring Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to charge users for Memories storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.\n“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nStarbase, the company town that Elon Musk’s SpaceX created in South Texas, is forming its own police squad.\nThe city’s commission approved an ordinance during a special meeting Tuesday that would create a municipal police department, subject to approval from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). The department will be run by a chief of police elected by the city’s commission, and is expected to hire eight officers, according to local news outlet Valley Central. It could be up and running in a few months.\n“There is a lot of assets here with the operations of SpaceX,” Starbase city administrator Kent Myers told the outlet. “Those assets need to be protected, and so the police department will play a critical part in protecting those assets.”\nIt’s not clear if Starbase has submitted its application to the TCOLE yet. The city and the TCOLE did not respond to requests for comment. Starbase reportedly hired security consulting firm Vision Quest Solutions to build out the department.\nStarbase is where SpaceX makes and tests its prototype Starship rocket. The city is small — it is currently home to just a few hundred residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees (or family of those workers). But it is geographically isolated. The closest neighboring town is Brownsville, which is about 10 miles away, though the drive can take 45 minutes or longer.\nA police department would be the latest addition to public services that have become available in Starbase since it was incorporated as a city last year. In October, a handful of SpaceX employees who live at Starbase started a volunteer fire department. The city also created a fire marshal position and took on its own building inspections and permitting around that same time.\nStarbase initially tried to handle law enforcement within its city limits by contracting with the Cameron County sheriff’s office. The city struck a $3.5 million, five-year contract with the sheriff’s office that was supposed to see two deputies patrol the city at a time, with eight deputies overall assigned to the detail. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStarbase also struck an agreement last year with the sheriff’s office to use the county’s jail. The company town agreed to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse any additional expenses, like medical care.\nThe deal apparently has not worked out, though.\n“We didn’t have a lot of success in finding deputies through the county, so we decided to change direction,” Myers told Valley Central. That was apparently due in part to the contract not having civil service protections, Sheriff Manuel Treviño told the outlet.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAnthropic’s Super Bowl commercial, one of four ads the AI lab dropped on Wednesday, begins with the word “BETRAYAL” splashed boldly across the screen. The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.\nThe bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.\nAnother commercial features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.\nThe Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s recent announcement that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic “mocks,” “skewers” and “dunks” on OpenAI.\nThey are funny enough that even Sam Altman admitted on X that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”\n\nFirst, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…— Sam Altman (@sama) February 4, 2026\n\nIn that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin.\nBut the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on its blog. “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”\nAltman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”\nBut Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.\nAltman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.\nTrue, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been “responsible AI.” The company was founded by two former OpenAI alums, after all, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.\nStill, both chatbot companies have usage policies, AI guardrails, and talk about AI safety. And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to be used for erotica while Anthropic does not, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that some content should be blocked, particularly in regards to mental health.\nYet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”\n“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.\nUsing “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which protesters around the world have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.\n\n\n\n"

    "body": "\nTinder is turning to a new AI-powered feature, Chemistry, to help it reduce so-called “swipe fatigue,” a growing problem among online dating users who are feeling burned out and are in search of better outcomes.\nIntroduced last quarter, the Match-owned dating app said that Chemistry leverages AI to get to know users through questions and, with permission, accesses their Camera Roll on their phone to learn more about their interests and personality.\nOn Match’s Q4 2026 earnings call, one analyst from Morgan Stanley asked for an update on the product’s success so far.\nMatch CEO Spencer Rascoff noted that Chemistry was still only being tested in Australia for the time being, but said that the feature offered users an “AI way to interact with Tinder.” He explained that users could choose to answer questions to then “get just a single drop or two, rather than swiping through many, many profiles.” \nIn addition to Chemistry’s Q&A and Camera Roll features, the company plans to use the AI feature in other ways going forward, the CEO also hinted.  \nMost importantly, Rascoff said the feature is designed to combat swipe fatigue — a complaint from users who say they have to swipe through too many profiles to find a potential match. \nThe company’s turn toward AI comes as Tinder and other dating apps have been experiencing paying subscriber declines, user burnout, and declines in new sign-ups.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the fourth quarter, new registrations on Tinder were still down 5% year-over-year, and its monthly active users were down 9%. These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.\nMatch said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust. To do so, the company said it is redesigning discovery to make it less repetitive and is using other features, like Face Check — a facial recognition verification system — to cut down on bad actors. On Tinder, the latter led to a more than 50% reduction in interactions with bad actors, Match noted.\nTinder’s decision to start moving away from the swipe toward more targeted, AI-powered recommendations could have a significant impact on the dating app. Today, the swipe method, which was popularized by Tinder, encourages users to think that they’re choosing a match from an endless number of profiles. But in reality, the app presents the illusion of choice, since matches have to be two-way to connect, and even then, a spark is not guaranteed.\nThe company delivered an earnings beat in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $878 million and EPS of 83 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates. But weak guidance saw the stock decline on Tuesday, before rising again in premarket trading on Wednesday.\nBeyond AI, Match will also increase its product marketing to help boost Tinder engagement. The company is committing to $50 million in Tinder marketing spend, which will include creator campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, where users will make claims that “Tinder is cool again,” Rascoff noted. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGizmo, a TikTok-like app for vibe-coded mini applications, is offering a new way to create interactive media. The relatively new mobile app from the startup Atma Sciences lets anyone create experiences using text, photos, sound, and touch, which are then displayed in a vertical feed, similar to TikTok or Reels. But unlike traditional short-form video apps, you don’t just watch and scroll in Gizmo — you play.\nDepending on the type of “Gizmo” you encounter, you might poke the screen, swipe, tap, draw, drag, and more to interact with the mini app. These Gizmos aren’t just games but are more like digital toys — things that could include interactive puzzles, memes, art, animation, or anything else a creator can dream up.\nImage Credits:Gizmo\nThe result is an engaging, playful feed, where you can like and comment on the tiny creations and even remix existing Gizmos to create your own version, if you choose.\nWhat’s more, you don’t need to know how to code or even vibe code to get started. Instead, you can simply type out an AI prompt to explain your idea using natural language.\nThe app then leverages AI coding technology to turn your idea into an interactive experience by generating the code that makes it work. As part of this process, Gizmo will also render your idea visually to ensure that each app functions properly and runs smoothly. Apps are also vetted using AI and human moderation to ensure user safety, a company FAQ notes.\n\nGizmo hails from a New York-based startup called Atma Sciences, co-founded by Rudd Fawcett and Brandon Francis, along with CEO Josh Siegel and CTO Daniel Amitay. The company last year raised a $5.49 million seed round from First Round Capital and others, according to data from PitchBook. On the company’s website (which is also silly and interactive), the team explains their focus is on combining “powerful technology with simple, elegant foundations,” starting with their creativity app, Gizmo.\nNone of the company’s founders responded to requests for an interview when TechCrunch reached out through multiple emails, requests to investors, and via LinkedIn. We were told by one investor that the team isn’t yet ready to do press. (Sorry!)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch was drawn to Gizmo because of the app’s potential for growth and its unique approach to the vibe-coding space (and a rare recommendation from my teen). The company is envisioning a world where anyone can create apps for fun, not just for a purpose, as with other vibe-coding app platforms for micro apps, like Anything, and others.\nDespite being relatively new, Gizmo’s feed isn’t repetitive. It’s filled with creative mini apps, leading to an experience that feels somewhat like a mash-up between TikTok and the interactive 3D-space designer, Rooms. But while Rooms introduced the programming language Lua to those who wanted more advanced controls over their creations, Gizmo keeps things prompt-based and simple.\nThe app is incredibly easy to use. You simply type out your prompt and then see how it turns out, and then modify as needed. In one test, the AI quickly coded a mini quiz, but we had to instruct it to edit the title, which was cut off at the top of the screen.\nThe resulting creation can be shared to the app’s feed, messaged to a friend, or posted to social media using a unique URL.\nAccording to data from market intelligence firm Appfigures, Gizmo has roughly 600,000 installs, with around half coming from the U.S., after being introduced with little fanfare less than six months ago. Around 235,000 of its downloads came in December alone, representing 39% of its total count.\nGizmo’s growth from October to December was 312%, with December installs up 50% month-over-month and November installs up 180% from October. \nThe app is available on both iOS and Android.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nA notorious hacking group has claimed responsibility for last year’s data breaches at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and published the data that they claim to have stolen from the two schools. \nOn Wednesday, the group known as ShinyHunters published what it claims are more than 1 million records from each university on the group’s dedicated leak site, which the gang uses to extort its victims.\nIn November, UPenn confirmed a data breach of “a select group of information systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities.” At the time, the hackers also sent alumni emails announcing the hack from official university addresses. \nThe university blamed the breach on social engineering, an attack that often relies on hackers impersonating someone and tricking them into doing something they would not normally do. In its official breach disclosure web page, which has since been taken offline, UPenn did not say exactly what type of data the hackers stole, simply saying the cybercriminals accessed “systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities.”\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these breaches, or similar attacks?

Cybercriminals like ShinyHunters often try to extort their victims asking for payment in exchange for not publishing the data they stole, and if the victims refuse payment, they then release the data online. \nDuring the UPenn breach, the hackers made it seem like they had political motives, in particular they expressed discontent with affirmative action policies. “We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits,” the hackers wrote in the email sent to alumni. \nShinyHunters is not known to have political motives. The hackers did not respond to a question asking why they included that language in the email. \nPenn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch that the university is “analyzing the data and will notify any individuals if required by applicable privacy regulations.”\nHarvard did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

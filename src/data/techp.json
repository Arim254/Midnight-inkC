    "body": "\nRicha Kaul says she’s a bit of a data privacy nut. At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.” \nSo she launched a company called Complyance to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance. \n“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review. \nThese risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors. \n“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to general, risk, and compliance. \nOthers in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.\nKaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard. \nThe fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn’t sign up to chase down mundane tasks. \n“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we’re able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.” \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nUniversity of Texas spinout Apptronik, a builder of humanoid robots for Google DeepMind among others, on Wednesday announced that it re-opened its Series A to raise a total of $935 million for the round.\nWhile the company did not disclose the valuation, TechCrunch separately learned that its post-money valuation is now about $5.3 billion.\nApptronik previously announced a $350 million Series A a year ago, but demand was so strong, according to the company, that it expanded the round to $415 million. Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.\nWhile it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that’s not exactly what’s happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.\nWhy not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.\nFair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, had raised nearly $2 billion total since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.\nPart of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has partnered with Google DeepMind, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDespite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As we’ve previously reported, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded. That’s when members of the Human Centered Robotics Lab from the University of Austin at Texas competed in the NASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, working on a robot called Valkyrie. Since then, the space agency has maintained a partnership with Apptronik as the company has readied its own humanoid robot, named Apollo.\n"

For instance, users will be able to hide the notification area from prying eyes.\nReports suggest that the top phone in the lineup will run Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor in the U.S. and China. Samsung will likely opt for its own Exynos 2600 processor in other regions. The distinction matters, but increasingly less so. Snapdragon processors have historically outperformed Samsung’s Exynos chips in benchmarks and thermal efficiency, but the performance gap has been narrowing.\nAccording to a report from the tech site SamMobile, the S26 will also have a 5,100 mAh (milliamp-hour, a standard unit of battery capacity) battery and will support 60W wired charging along and 25W wireless charging.\nIn addition to phones, Samsung is likely to release updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. The company plans to update the design from the previous generation, which drew widespread comparisons to Apple’s AirPods.\nThe event will begin at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET/ 7 PM CET, and will be streamed live on Samsung’s website and its YouTube channel.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSamsung is offering a $30 promotional credit to anyone who pre-registers interest it its upcoming devices. Pre-registering is merely an expression of interest; consumers will still get the credit as a discount toward other Samsung products even if they don’t end up buying the new devices.

    "body": "\nThe fight to tame spreadsheets with AI isn’t over yet. A new company called Meridian has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.\n“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”\nThe round was led by Andressen Horowitz and the General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Litquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.\nExcel agents have been a popular target for AI startups, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents like Shortcut AI built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.\nBased in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.\nAs Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.\n“If you go to ten different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the Meridian team has done significant work to make their outputs more auditable and deterministic, while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based tools. The result is a mixture of agentic AI and more conventional tooling, minimizing the hallucinations that slow down many enterprise deployments.\n“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Ling says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they’re coming from.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nMasha Bucher, a Silicon Valley VC and founder of Day One Ventures, took to X this week to address news reports documenting her close business and personal relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Bucher’s name — primarily under her maiden name, Masha Drokova — appeared in the latest dump of Epstein files over 1,600 times, The San Francisco Standard reported.\n“He made me feel I could be safe from the regime, someone with power and connections who could shield me” from threats she associated with her home country Russia, which she said she feared after she obtained her U.S. green card, she wrote in the post.\n“I was naive; I didn’t dig deep enough early on,” she wrote about why she agreed to work with Epstein. “I believed his story that his earlier conviction was about sleeping with a girl who lied about her age and trusted validations from multiple investors and scientists.” She also apologized to her founders, team, and investors, saying that this situation has “caused pain I never intended.”\nThe files paint a picture of how Bucher — whose Silicon Valley career began in social media and public relations — agreed to become Epstein’s publicist in 2017, helping rehabilitate his reputation after his 2008 sex-trafficking conviction and setting up meetings between him and various journalists, as Forbes reported.\nThe documents show that Epstein supported and encouraged her in the early days of Day One Ventures. The firm has since grown substantially — as Bucher told TechCrunch, it closed its most recent fund, a $150 million third vehicle, in 2024, bringing its assets under management to $450 million.\nSome of the most salacious details from the emails involve Epstein giving her money and a Prada bag, and on one occasion, asking her for nude photos — though there’s no indication whether she complied — according to SFGate. Bucher is certainly a well-known VC in the Valley, having backed breakout companies like Superhuman, Remote, Worldcoin, and Truebill (which exited to Rocket Companies in 2021), as well as others like Valar Atomics.\nThe whole episode is a particularly awkward one for a VC whose whole spiel to founders is that she’s a PR expert who can help them with their public image. But it’s not Bucher’s first run-in with controversy.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen younger, Bucher was known in Russia as a member of Nashi, a pro-Putin youth group. In fact, she was featured in a 2012 documentary called “Putin’s Kiss” — named for the widely circulated moment in the country when she kissed Putin’s cheek — as CNN reported.\nIn her post on X, she said she has since given up her Russian passport, publicly denounced Putin, and met with some of Epstein’s victims.\nShe’s certainly not the only VC whose name has been found in the Epstein files, which is not surprising given how connected he was to some of the biggest names in tech. The documents do not indicate that Bucher broke laws. However, she was engaged in friendly correspondence with Epstein until just 11 days before his arrest in July 2019, Forbes reported. Epstein died in jail roughly one month later.\n"

    "body": "\nMonday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It’s time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote in a late-night post on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”\nLess than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.\nOn their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.\nBy all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.\nThere are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.\nWhatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.\nIn short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nTikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user’s current location. The feed’s arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok’s terms of service under the new U.S. joint venture, which said that the app would begin to collect precise location information from TikTok users.\nToday, TikTok confirms the reason it’s now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.\nThe Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, including the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. \nThe company explains in its announcement that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content’s topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.\nThe new feature also ties into TikTok’s push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many small businesses rely on its services to reach their customers.\nTikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a 2025 Oxford Economics report. The company also highlighted figures from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, which found that 84% of TikTok small business users said the platform helped grow their business, and 75% said TikTok helped them reach customers beyond their local area. In addition, another 74% said TikTok helps them connect with their local community.\nAs TikTok sees it, the Local Feed will help to generate real-world traffic and sales for these brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nThe first time users access the Local Feed, they’ll be prompted to allow the app to use their location data. On iOS, for example, the pop-up request will allow users to pick whether they want to allow the activity once or while using the app or not at all. \n“This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,” the company writes in its announcement. However, TikTok would have likely seen a better reception to this feature had it rolled out the request for precise location data before its ownership transition in the U.S., or at least at the same time. That way, the app could at least point to a reason as to why it wanted to collect this additional data.\nStill, even if the location data now has a purpose, it’s worth considering whether or not the value of a local feed is worth the privacy risk. \nTikTok also notes that the feature will be available only to users 18 and older and will only collect information while the app is in use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nInertia Enterprises has raised $450 million to build one of the world’s most powerful lasers, which it hopes will serve as the foundation of a grid-scale power plant the fusion startup intends to start construction on in 2030.\nInertia Enterprises is building on technology developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility. The NIF is the site of the world’s only controlled fusion reactions that have reached scientific breakeven, in which the reaction releases more energy than it took to start. \nThe Series A was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from GV, Modern Capital, Threshold Ventures, and others. Inertia’s co-founders include Jeff Lawson, who co-founded Twilio and served as its CEO, Annie Kircher, who led the successful experiments at NIF, and Mike Dunne, a Stanford professor who helped Lawrence Livermore develop a power plant design based on NIF. Kircher has remained in her position at Lawrence Livermore.\nNIF’s breakeven experiments have been a key milestones on the road to widespread fusion power. However, considerable progress needs to be made before a fusion power plant can deliver electricity to the grid. For Inertia, that means building a laser capable of delivering 10 kilojoules ten times per second.\nThe startup’s reactor relies on a form of fusion known as inertial confinement. In Inertia’s flavor of inertial confinement, lasers bombard a fuel target, compressing the fuel until atoms inside fuse and release energy. The technique is based on NIF’s designs, in which laser light is converted into X-rays inside the target. The X-rays are what ultimately heat and compress the fuel pellet.\nEach of Inertia’s power plants will require 1,000 of its lasers bombarding 4.5 mm targets that cost less than $1 each to mass produce. By contrast, the NIF’s system uses 192 lasers to fire on painstakingly crafted targets that take dozens of hours to make. Inertia is betting that by using the same basic principles as NIF and applying a more commercial mindset, it can bring the costs down dramatically.\nInertia’s new round is the latest in a string of funding announcements from fusion startups in recent months. With this round and others, fusion startups have attracted more than $10 billion in investments. And at least a dozen companies have raised more than $100 million.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast week, Avalanche said it had raised $29 million to advance its desktop-sized fusion reactor. Earlier this year, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it had attracted $87 million in investment in advance of a $250 million Series B that it’s currently raising. Last summer, Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised $863 million from dozens of investors, including Google, Nvidia, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.\nTwo fusion companies recently announced they were going public via reverse mergers. General Fusion said in January it would merge with acquisition company Spring Valley III in a deal that values the combined company at $1 billion. General Fusion had previously struggled to raise money from private investors. Earlier last month, TAE Technologies announced it would merge with Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group; the combined company would be worth $6 billion, according to the all-stock transaction.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJohn Conafay, a veteran of the US Air Force, has spent most of his career leading business development at public and private aerospace companies, including Spire, Astranis, and ABL Space Systems.  \nAt each company, Conafay ran into the same software hurdle: collaborating on government contracts was a logistical mess that forced his teams and their federal counterparts to rely on a tedious back-and-forth of PDFs and Excel files. The bottleneck was always the same—most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.\nSo, in early 2022, Conafay launched Integrate, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the US Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a $25 million, five-year contract from the US Space Force.\nThat validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known for early bets on Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.\nUntil recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the US Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.\nThis shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.\n“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Conafay, what sets Integrate apart from its civilian-focused competitors is its ability to let different organizations simultaneously and securely collaborate on massive project schedules while keeping sensitive details hidden from other participants.\nIntegrate is designed to handle the coordination of mammoth, multi-year mega-projects, such as the F-35 Lightning II program or the James Webb Space Telescope, where thousands of partners must stay in sync, Conafay explained.\nWhile he was careful not to reveal too much about customers besides the Space Force, he did say that some of the work the startup is doing for that branch of US military involves deployments of large rockets.\n“They have to coordinate tens of satellites on a single launch across dozens of missions,” Conafay said. “The complexity is pretty extreme, and they use us to coordinate those things.”\nIntegrate intends to grow by selling its software to other branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy, the Army, and the intelligence community, as well as to the private companies that serve them.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen Sam Blond left his job as a VC for Founders Fund a year ago — just 18 months after he started — he told the world that being a VC wasn’t for him and he was “going back to operating.”  \nOn Wednesday, he officially brought his new startup, Monaco, out of stealth. It was co-founded with his brother Brian Blond, who is also an ex-sales professional turned VC. (Brian is a partner at Human Capital and was formerly at Sutter Hill.) The brothers are joined by two other co-founders, Abishek Viswanathan (previously CPO at Apollo and Qualtrics), and Malay Desai (formerly SVP of engineering at Clari). \nMonaco has raised a total of $35 million, between a $10 million seed and $25 million Series A round, Sam Blond tells TechCrunch. Both rounds were led by Founders Fund, with participation from Human Capital. The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta. \nThe well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta.  \nSo what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work. \nThe startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts. It includes other features, too, like a meeting notetaker. \nThe product is intended to automate much of the sales grunt work. “We can replace full workflows with agents,” Blond says (pictured above, third from left, with brother Brian, pictured second from left). For instance, Monaco builds a database of prospects, identifies the exact people at a target company to pitch, and the sequence in which to target them. “We orchestrate and execute that sequence. We schedule a meeting,” Blond says. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe human-in-the-loop salespeople help ensure that the AI isn’t hallucinating and train it to sell the product, and the actual customer meetings are done by the people. No avatars. \nThat makes Monaco a rare AI sales startup that isn’t talking about human replacement. Instead, it’s making experienced salespeople available to companies too nascent to hire them directly. \n“It’s this combination of the technology, but also the service,” Blond says. “Monaco does not have an agent pretending to be a sales rep trying to sell to the customer.” \nCurrently, Monaco’s main competition is HubSpot, priced as it is to be more affordable for young companies than the big kahuna of the market, Salesforce. Blond declined to tell us what Monaco will charge, except to say that it’s a flat fee and currently discounted while the product remains in beta.  \nHe’s also well aware that he’s in an exceptionally crowded market. Y Combinator alone has graduated hundreds of sales startups in the past couple of years, ranging from AI CRMs to niche AI tools. Then there’s startups like Attio, Clay, and Conversion, and the crop of so-called AI SDR (sales-development representative) tools — human-replacement agentic startups like 11x, Artisan, and 1mind.\nOn top of that, the incumbents, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, and ZoomInfo, are all offering their own AI and agentic tools.  \nBlond points out that today’s top players were built in another era, and none of the upstarts are performing well enough to be a clear-cut winner. \n“There definitely is not the ‘Cursor for sales’,” he says, referring to the popular AI coding tool. “But there will be.” \nHe obviously wants Monaco to be that winner. “In the broad category of sales technology, there’s a market leader right now. That market leader is Salesforce,” Blond says. “We are in the early innings of the next platform shift that will lead to a new market leader.”\nStill, out of all the areas he could have entered after leaving Founders Fund, why duke it out among so much competition?  \nBlond, speaking earnestly, says that having spent his entire career in sales, “As a non-technical founder, there’s really only one type of technology company that I’m qualified to be the founder of: a sales technology company.” \nHe’s clearly having fun doing so. The company employs about 40 people and the office, filled with fellow career salespeople, sports WWII-esque motivational posters on the wall with slogans like “Save Startups” and “Build the future with Monaco.” There’s even an office gong that rings out every time the AI lands a meeting with a prospect. \n"

    "body": "\nThe AI industry’s pursuit of licensable content has been a messy affair, filled with lawsuits and accusations of copyright infringement. Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.\nThe Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.\nReached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.” \nAmazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.\nThe move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.  \nThose efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.\nMedia publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "description": "According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult.",
    "body": "\nOn Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.\nAccording to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”\nWhat Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”  \nIt isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.\nThe moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time. \nIt’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.\nRationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.\nWhether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. \nAs Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon.”\nThat legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023.

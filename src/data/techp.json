    "body": "<div>\n<p>Silicon Valley is full of comfortable offices with gleaming meeting rooms and on-site baristas. So when early <a href=\"https://www.upstartsmedia.com/p/happyrobot-spanish-founders-ai-logistics\" target=\"_blank\">HappyRobot</a> engineer Ari Polakof decided to strike out and start his own company, he didn’t exactly expect to wind up tapping on his laptop in a service bay alongside mechanics.</p>\n<p>“Very noisy, impossible to concentrate,” he laughed.</p>\n<p>But that’s part of the story of how Polakof’s new AI-for-car-dealerships startup Flai got off the ground last year.</p>\n<p>Founded by Polakof and his brother Alen (also from HappyRobot) at Y Combinator, along with former Netflix data scientist Juan Alzugary, Flai is one of a number of startups trying to use artificial intelligence to improve the experience of buying, selling, or servicing a car at a dealership.</p>\n<p>The co-founders have built software from the ground up that’s specially tailored for the car dealership environment. And it’s “omni-channel,” as Polakof said in an interview, meaning it can handle phone calls (using voice agents) as well as emails and texts (using large language models).</p>\n<p>Now, Flai has closed a $4.5 million seed round to try and scale up what they’ve built. The round was led by Liz Wessel at First Round Capital, and included funding from YC, RedBlue Capital, Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures, and Innovation Endeavors.  </p>\n<p>Flai is not the only one doing this kind of work. Earlier this year, another YC-backed startup called Toma announced it had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/tomas-ai-voice-agents-have-taken-off-at-car-dealerships-and-attracted-funding-from-a16z/\">raised $17 million</a> from the likes of a16z and Yossi Levi, the car industry influencer known as Car Dealership Guy. A swarm of others are trying to build similar products, while legacy interactive voice response companies — the ones who make the phone tree software we’ve all become overly familiar with — look to keep pace.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Polakof, who is CEO, said Flai’s offering is different in that it’s not using off-the-shelf voice tech. The startup has built essentially everything from scratch, which in particular has made its voice agents impressive enough that Polakof claims it’s already convinced a few dealers to switch from other companies.</p>\n<p>Besides, he said, there is a lot of room for competition in the market. There are thousands of car dealerships and service centers across the United States, and the majority of them have the same problem: they can lose potential customers if their phone lines are tied up. </p>\n<p>After getting off the ground last year, the Flai team realized the best way to train their AI, and to start racking up customers, was to start showing up at those dealerships.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they tried cold calling, or emailing, or LinkedIn messaging, or even showing up at conferences to network. But the bulk of the early work Flai got done was from going directly to the brick-and-mortar locations — around 400 in those early days, by Polakof’s count.</p>\n<p>Once Flai struck up these initial relationships, Polakof said they essentially embedded with each dealer. That’s how he found himself in a service bay last year — though, he said, more often it just meant setting up in an empty office.</p>\n<p>Polakof said the Flai team spent “every day, all day on the road” during that initial period. “It’s almost very tiring, painful, but I think it’s the only way, and I can’t imagine a bigger company doing it,” he said.</p>\n<p>As the startup transitions out of that learning period and into one more focused on growing and making customers happy, Polakof said the small team is still pushing long hours — like so many of their <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-china-996-work-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">peers in Silicon Valley</a>.</p>\n<p>The seed funding will help Flai grow, but Polakof said he doesn’t expect the team to explode. </p>\n<p>“We want to work as smart as we can,” he said. “We don’t want to have 100, 200 people working on this right now.” Instead, he said the three-man team keeps each other “accountable” by focusing on tasks that are “100% required, otherwise it’s not worth it.”</p>\n<p>In that sense, Polakof isn’t so far from those earliest days working in a service bay or dealership back office — just with less noise and fewer mechanics.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Anthropic has a new chief technical officer, former Stripe CTO Rahul Patil. Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.</p>\n<p>As part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company’s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.</p>\n<p>This new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\">plans to spend $600 billion</a> on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic’s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the popularity of Anthropic’s Claude products has already put the company’s infrastructure under significant strain. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/\">In July</a>, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.</p>\n<p>With more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil’s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,” the statement reads. “I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude’s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”</p>\n<p>In a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic’s research and commitment to AI safety. “I’m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” Patil said, adding that his work at the company “feels like the most important work I could be doing right now — I personally can’t think of a greater calling and responsibility.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Zehra Naqvi, 26, grew up as an obsessive fan girl in the 2010s. </p>\n<p>This was the era of Tumblr and Twitter. She would stay up all night breaking down the release dates of Marvel movies or analyzing the movements of One Direction members. She eventually gained a collective 250,000 followers across the two platforms.  “Those early internet rabbit holes taught me how magical it felt to not just consume culture but to contribute to it,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>She went on to start a company at 12, study art history at Columbia, and then became a consumer investor at Headline Ventures. (She also writes the popular <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thezlist-irl.beehiiv.com/\">consumer newsletter The Z List.</a>) </p>\n<p>Now, she’s starting something new: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lorelegendmyth.com/\">Lore</a>, a search platform for people to research and discover internet obsessions. The company has already raised $1.1 million in pre-seed funding. It is set to emerge from stealth on October 6th. </p>\n<p>It was a few months ago that she quit her job at Headline she decided to go back to the beginning. She recalled those early days of spiraling down internet rabbit holes and became dismayed when she realized that all that research she spent hours in the pleasure pursuit of was gone. “How is it possible that I’ve spent probably well over 500 hours reading about Marvel movies over 17 years and no single platform tracks my consumption,” she said.</p>\n<p>Lore provides the tools she wished “had existed when fandom felt like home before the internet became fractured and joyless,” she said. It lets consumers go down rabbit holes, providing links to fan theories, interpretations, cultural context, and easter eggs. According to Naqvi, it builds a personalized graph of obsessions; surfaces fandom and stan updates in a feed; and gives monthly reports to users about what their obsessions are at any given time. </p>\n<p>“You can zoom in on a single theory or zoom out and see how all your fandoms connect,” Naqvi said. “It’s like playing with knowledge instead of just consuming it.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Naqvi is mum for now on how the product works. She also declined to share any imagery, saying that Lore’s official hard launch isn’t until next year. “It’s our special sauce,” she said of the technology powering the product. </p>\n<p>She did say, however, that rapid fandom consumption hasn’t really changed online, even though new social media channels have popped up for users to interact. “If anything, fandom is more fragmented than ever, and as you get older, joy spiraling becomes harder to find time for,” she said. As an investor, she began to realize that perhaps there didn’t need to be any more social tools for fans. </p>\n<p>“There are plenty of places to yap,” she said, adding that so much of social media these days aims for quick dopamine hits, doomscrolling, or feeds into “iPad kid behavior.” The next version of social media will be quieter, she said, more human, and built around passion and memory.</p>\n<p>“Lore is our attempt to rebuild the Library of Alexandria for the fandom age.” </p>\n<p>Naqvi is a solo founder and has already made her first two hires: a marketing executive and an engineer. She described her fundraising process as “obsessive.” Village Global led the round with participation from Precursor Ventures. </p>\n<p>“Lore is building the product fandoms have been waiting for,” Charles Hudson, managing partner at Precursor Ventures, told TechCrunch. “We envision it as the essential app for fandoms to gather, share, and deepen their engagement with the things they love.”</p>\n<p>Naqvi said the fresh capital will be used to attract more users and continue running product testing. </p>\n<p>“We wrapped up an experiment with over 1,000 logins, nearly 24,000 searches, and a collective eight days, or about 200 hours straight of spiraling deep into obsessions,” she said. “That level of engagement is kind of insane and proves the need for what we are building.” </p>\n<p>Lore is not without competition. In the age of AI search engines, she said, people have drawn comparisons to Perplexity, while others note it provides the same function as Reddit or Wikipedia. “But none of these spaces were built with fandom in mind,” she said. </p>\n<p>“We are building a lurker-first space,” she continued, describing Lore as “interactive, colorful, and designed for play. She hopes Lore will restore some joy to the internet and create a place where obsession is not embarrassing but sacred. </p>\n<p>“Consumer AI doesn’t always have to be an agent that helps you shop or a glorified assistant or another social app,” she said. “There are so many more inventive and joy-first ways to apply it, and Lore is proving that.” </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">Sora app</a> for AI videos is a viral hit, despite being invite-only for now and limited to users in the U.S. and Canada at launch. On <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its first day</a>, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures.</p>\n<p>The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30th and October 1st.</p>\n<p>The day-one figure puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.</p>\n<p>Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even <em>more</em> installs if it were open to all users.</p>\n<p>Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-staff-grapples-with-the-companys-social-media-push/\">chagrin of some at OpenAI</a>, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking</a>, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)</p>\n<p>To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/openai-launches-an-official-chatgpt-app-for-ios/\">limited itself to U.S. users</a> at the time, while Grok <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/xai-is-testing-a-standalone-ios-app-for-its-grok-chatbot/\">limited its iOS-only</a> release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/anthropics-claude-sees-tepid-reception-on-ios-compared-with-chatgpts-debut/\">its Claude app to iOS last year</a>. </p>\n<p>For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.</p>\n<p>Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>When Jamie Gull graduated from Stanford University in 2007 with a master’s degree in aeronautics, there was one place he wanted to go next: the desert. </p>\n<p>The Mojave desert, to be specific. A company called Scaled Composites had spent years developing experimental aircraft out on that arid land, and Gull wanted in. </p>\n<p>He could have tried to get a more traditional aerospace job, but Gull was worried he’d “work five years on a latch” — a common joke about those bigger, slow-moving companies. But at Scaled Composites? “I knew I would build something, and I would do it quickly, and I would be a college graduate who would own an actual outcome,” he said.</p>\n<p>Two years later, Gull jumped to SpaceX, where he helped make the Falcon 9 rocket reusable — a major milestone in that company’s history, and the foundation on which it has built an enormously valuable business.</p>\n<p>Now, Gull is gearing up for a new challenge: launching an early-stage deep tech fund called <a href=\"https://www.wavefunction.vc/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">Wave Function Ventures</a>. Just last week, he closed Wave Function’s first fund of $15.1 million, and he’s already off and running.</p>\n<p>Gull has made nine investments in startups that span industries like nuclear energy (Deep Fission), humanoid robotics (Persona AI), and, of course, aerospace (Airship Industries). He told TechCrunch he expects to do about 25 seed or pre-seed investments out of this fund. (Gull declined to name the anchor LP, and said the rest of the fund was filled by high net worth individuals, with support from other funds and “large family offices.”)</p>\n<p>Wave Function’s emergence comes at a time when deep tech funding is on the rise, buoyed in part by the increased attention on fields like aerospace and defense. It’s enough of a trend that earlier this year, a new Silicon Valley-based deep tech fund called Leitmotif <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/meet-the-new-vc-firm-secretly-backed-by-volkswagen/\" target=\"_blank\">broke cover with $300 million in capital from the Volkswagen Group</a>, part of a bid to lift up hardware and manufacturing startups in the United States and Europe.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It’s the kind of environment that seems ripe for someone with a background like Gull’s — and not just his past as an accomplished aerospace engineer.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his time at SpaceX in 2016, Gull started angel investing, making bets on companies like Boom Supersonic, K2 Space, and Varda. He also co-founded electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startup Talyn Air as part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and became a venture partner at YC’s Pioneer Fund — a position he still holds. (Talyn was acquired in 2023 by another eVTOL company, Ampaire.)</p>\n<p>Gull wants to put all this varied experience — doing rapid prototyping, founding a startup, angel investing — to use at Wave Function.</p>\n<p>“I can really leverage that to help all my founders get through those early stages when things are like the most uncertain, and then help them build their companies,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gull also believes deep tech is going to be a place for big returns in the next 10 to 20 years. Startups in this space may require more capital up front, he said, but they can leverage non-venture funding (like government contracts or asset-backed lending) to scale and establish a more solid moat than software companies. </p>\n<p>Getting to those big returns will take time and Gull is fine with that. While he began his career as an eager builder, he also knows the value of patience.</p>\n<p>When he was at Scaled Composites fifteen years ago, one of the projects he worked on was Stratolaunch, the largest plane in the world at the time. It was such an enormously complex aircraft that it remained in development long after Gull moved to SpaceX and beyond.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until 2019 when Gull and his Talyn co-founder Evan Mucasey were planning to head to a “fly-in” (think: car show but for cool planes) at the Mojave airport that he got a hint he might see the giant airplane fly.</p>\n<p>“I called a friend and said, ‘what time should we be there for the airplane show?’ And he said, ‘6 a.m.’ I was like, that makes no sense,” Gull said. He didn’t know what his friend was hinting at, but he believed it would be worth the early flight. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, as Gull and Mucasey approached the airport, there was Stratolaunch, parked on the runway and prepped for flight. They landed and, per Gull’s recollection, Stratolaunch took off 15 minutes later.</p>\n<p>“I think it was almost exactly 10 years after I had worked on it on a computer screen,” Gull said. “It was wild.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "description": "The Trump administration canceled over 300 awards related to clean energy on October 1. The states most affected by the cuts voted for Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy. </p>\n<p>The agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.</p>\n<p>Direct air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&E News is <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-cancellations-hit-hydrogen-air-capture-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> that hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.</p>\n<p>At least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO<sub>2</sub> can be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.</p>\n<p>Other states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.</p>\n<p>The Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838\">tweet</a> from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” </p>\n<p>All 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level. Conspicuously, Vought omitted Trump-voting states that were on the list.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The awards were originally granted by the office for Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Grid Deployment, and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.</p>\n<p>The Department of Energy said 26% of the awards were granted between Election Day and Inauguration Day in January; the president’s authority doesn’t end after Election Day, but runs until Inauguration Day. </p>\n<p>The awardees have 30 days to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has made no secret that it wants to undermine any transition away from fossil fuels. Last week, the Department of Energy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">banned staffers from using certain words</a>, including “climate change” and “emissions.”</p>\n<p>In May, the agency canceled $3.7 billion worth of clean energy and manufacturing awards. Those cancellations spanned a broad list of industries, from metal manufacturing and cement companies to power plant operators and chemical plants run by fossil fuel giants.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s aggressive cancellations have prompted many awardees to sue the government to retain the awards. The Environmental Protection Agency, which was quick to cancel contracts worth $20 billion, has been an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/fbi-epa-and-treasury-told-citibank-to-freeze-funds-as-trump-administration-tries-to-claw-back-climate-money/\">early target</a> of legal action. So far, the plaintiffs have had mixed success.</p>\n<p>While a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/judge-orders-citibank-to-release-nonprofit-funds-rejects-epa-arguments/\">federal district court said</a> the EPA’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” an appellate court <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/judges-side-with-trump-epa-over-canceled-inflation-reduction-act-grants-to-nonprofits/\">ruled in favor of the agency</a>, saying that the contract cancellations were valid and showed the government exercising “proper oversight and management.”</p>\n<p>In the instance of the recent DOE cancellations, several award recipients have already appealed the decision, the agency confirmed.</p>\n<p><em>Update: The article and headline have been updated to include further details about which states and programs are affected.</em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Out of eight shutdowns since 1990, four <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/business/dealbook/markets-shutdown-costs.html\" target=\"_blank\">have happened during Trump</a> administrations; the last one lasted 35 days, the longest in modern history. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch spoke to investors, founders, and lawyers who warned about delayed deal flow and visa processing for workers. The visa process had already been upended when President Trump recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\">announced the application fee for an H-1B visa </a>would increase to $100,000 — a number that caused sticker shock within the industry. </p>\n<p>The main concern is a slowed-down immigration process for startups, since the Department of Labor — which provides first approval for H-1B visas and green cards — is shut down. The result, immigration attorney Sophie Alcorn said, is that the pipeline for hiring and renewing visas for high-skilled workers is completely frozen. </p>\n<p>“This creates significant uncertainty for a startup’s workforce, including founders who may be on visas themselves,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>“Visa workers are hit hard in a shutdown because their status depends on government approvals,” Michael Scarpati, CEO and founder of the fintech RetireUS, added. “When processes like E-Verify or labor certifications stop, workers risk falling out of status, leaving their future in the U.S. uncertain and creating added disruption for the businesses that depend on them.” </p>\n<p>Thousands<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/h1b-visas-workers-charts-cb81493c\" target=\"_blank\"> of workers in tech are on visas,</a> many of them bringing partners and children with them.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Many are understandably nervous about processing delays and how that affects their ability to stay and work,” Chris Chib, CEO of the strategy solutions company BlueFin Solves, told TechCrunch. “But just as these engineers help us persevere through complex challenges with ML algorithms and innovation, we owe them the same careful attention and commitment during this situation.”</p>\n<p>Startups may also be affected by delayed or stopped permitting processes and other regulatory requirements, which could drain precious funds and even lead to layoffs.</p>\n<p>Jenny Fielding, managing partner at Everywhere Ventures, said ongoing political uncertainty always worries her. Though past shutdowns have had little economic impact, this one could lead to layoffs if it lasts too long. </p>\n<p>“Since we invest in many regulated areas, the shutdown can potentially halt-slash-slow down essential government functions like FDA approvals or aerospace permits, which can be an existential threat to a startup whose entire business model depends on a single regulatory green light,” Fielding told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Fielding said the timing of the shutdown has, once again, been terrible for her and the firm. When Everywhere Ventures started fundraising in early spring, President Trump announced the tariffs that caused uncertainty and drove up costs for some companies.</p>\n<p>The firm held off on fundraising at the time because limited partners were nervous about investing given the uncertain climate. “And of course, we kicked off fundraising this week, so once again, terrible timing,” she said.</p>\n<p>As for Fielding’s startups, she said it’s hard to wait and see in this case. Founders always need to think about a Plan B, she said, especially because capital is finite. </p>\n<p>“If it’s a week shutdown, then that’s manageable,” she continued. “But when it becomes weeks, then it can get uncomfortable.”  </p>\n<p>Garima Kapoor co-founded the software company MinIO with her husband, AB, who came to the U.S. on an H-1B visa a little over a decade ago. She said startups should start preparing now, just in case the government shutdown is prolonged. </p>\n<p>“When government agencies slow down, deals in highly regulated industries like fintech, health tech, or M&A can grind to a halt. Even companies operating outside the federal sphere could face shrinking valuations and tougher deal terms as more uncertainty seeps into the market,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Overall, founders should remain proactive, communicate transparently with partners and investors, and plan “prudently for slippage,” she said, noting that clarity and alignment will be key here. </p>\n<p>“Preparedness will separate those who weather the disruption from those who get caught flat-footed.” </p>\n<p>Chib echoed that sentiment. “Their resilience is part of what drives progress forward,” he said. ”To those facing these challenges, know this too shall pass. Persevere.” </p>\n</div>"

Because without tangible productivity gains, people might be less inclined to switch from their existing browsers.  </p>\n<p>For free users, Perplexity’s Comet browser experience is still limited to the sidecar assistant. All users can also access different tools like Discover (personalized news and content recommendations similar to OpenAI’s new Pulse); Spaces (to organize and manage different projects); Shopping (assists in comparing prices and finding deals across online retailers); Travel (offers aggregated information on travel destinations, flights, accommodation, etc.); Finance (tools for budgeting, tracking expenses, monitoring investments); and Sports (updates on scores, schedules, and news).  </p>\n<p>Max users get access to high-performing AI models and can access Perplexity’s email assistant, which promises to draft replies and write responses that match your tone; organize and prioritize your inbox; schedule meetings; and answer questions about your inbox.  </p>\n<p>Max users also get early access to Perplexity products and features, including a new “background assistant” that CEO Aravind Srinivas announced at an event Wednesday evening.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png 1282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=680,482 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=1200,850 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=1280,907 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=430,305 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=720,510 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=900,637 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=800,567 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=668,473 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=529,375 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=871,617 871w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=708,501 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=50,35 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Perplexity’s “background assistant” can perform multiple tasks at once</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A company spokesperson described the assistant as “a team of assistants working for you” that you can manage and track from a central dashboard like a “mission control.” </p>\n<p>The assistant performs multiple tasks on your computer in the background while you do other work or walk away to make a sandwich. In an example a spokesperson gave me, you could give the assistant a task to send an email, add the cheapest tickets to a concert to your cart, and find the best direct flight on a specific date and time. You can check the progress of the task completion in the dashboard and jump in to complete the tasks — like hitting send on the email, intervening, or taking over.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is bringing its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/googles-ai-coding-agent-jules-is-now-out-of-beta/\">AI coding agent</a> <a href=\"https://jules.google/\" target=\"_blank\">Jules</a> deeper into developer workflows with a new command-line interface and public API, allowing it to plug into terminals, CI/CD systems, and tools like Slack — as competition intensifies among tech companies to own the future of software development and make coding more of an AI-assisted task.</p>\n<p>Until now, Jules — Google’s asynchronous coding agent — was only accessible via its website and GitHub. On Thursday, the company introduced Jules Tools, a command-line interface that brings Jules directly into the developer’s terminal. The CLI lets developers interact with the agent using commands, streamlining workflows by eliminating the need to switch between the web interface and GitHub. It allows them to stay within their environment while delegating coding tasks and validating results.</p>\n<p>“We want to reduce context switching for developers as much as possible,” said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview.</p>\n<p>Google already offers Gemini CLI, an AI-based command-line tool that works across developer environments like terminals and CI/CD pipelines. Both Gemini CLI and Jules use Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model under the hood. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that Jules Tools is designed for “very scoped tasks,” while Gemini CLI requires users to be “a lot more iterative” and to “collaborate a lot more with the tool.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg 1582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1200,696 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1280,743 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=430,250 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=720,418 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=900,522 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=800,464 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=668,388 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=646,375 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1063,617 1063w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=708,411 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Google’s Jules Tools</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Google’s senior developer advocate Denise Kwan also elaborated in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@denisetkwan/gemini-cli-or-jules-which-tool-is-for-you-20b7d857641d\" target=\"_blank\">Medium post</a> on how Jules differs from Gemini CLI. Jules is less interactive by design, she noted, and executes tasks independently once the user approves its plan.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CLI, Google has made Jules’ API public, which it had previously used for internal development. The purpose of this is also to help developers use Jules more often as they can extend the tool into their existing workflows where they have “a lot of muscle memory and familiarity,” Korevec said.</p>\n<p>Developers can also use the API to integrate Jules with their integrated development environment (IDE), a software application that helps make coding easier by providing a list of tools, such as VS Code. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that her team is keen to build specific plug-ins for IDEs to further expand Jules’ presence.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The latest updates come just after Google introduced “memory” for Jules to keep a record of interactions with users and their preferences, nudges, and corrections. For the last few weeks, the tool has also <a href=\"http://jules.google/docs/changelog/\" target=\"_blank\">added a list of other features</a>, including a stacked layout for the diff viewer, image upload, and the ability to read and respond to comments on pull requests.</p>\n<p>Now, another area Google is exploring with Jules is reducing its reliance on GitHub. Currently, the agent codes within a GitHub repository — requiring developers to either connect it to an existing repo or provide a blank one to work in.</p>\n<p>“Users want Jules to integrate with other code hosting providers,” said Korevec. “We are looking into how we can enable that with other version control systems. We are also looking into enabling it for people who don’t want a version control system, or they don’t care where their code is hosted.”</p>\n<p>Oversight of AI tools remains a challenge, especially when they are used in professional settings. Jules, however, is designed to notify the user if it gets stuck on a particular task, prompting them to step in and assist.</p>\n<p>“If something happens where it runs into an issue, or it runs into a situation where it can’t unstick itself, it will pause and ask me a question,” Korevec said.</p>\n<p>However, oversight becomes more difficult when users interact with Jules on mobile, as native notifications are not yet supported. Korevec noted that many users are already accessing Jules through its mobile web interface, and said Google is working to improve the mobile experience — particularly by exploring ways to offer native notifications.</p>\n<p>So far, Jules has primarily been used by software engineers and other professionals — unlike many vibe coding platforms that position themselves as go-to tools for non-coders. Still, some users are experimenting with Jules as a complement to more casual or creative coding environments.</p>\n<p>“We see a lot of people take that project that they have hit the limit in whatever vibe coding tool they’re using, and then bring that to Jules for further extending it,” Korevec told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009702/google-debuts-a-coding-ai-agent-called-jules/\" target=\"_blank\">Launched in public preview</a> in May, Jules <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/googles-ai-coding-agent-jules-is-now-out-of-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">exited beta</a> in August and is now available under structured pricing tiers. A free plan offers up to 15 individual daily tasks and three concurrent tasks.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Allan Brooks never set out to reinvent mathematics. But after weeks spent talking with ChatGPT, the 47-year-old Canadian came to believe he had discovered a new form of math powerful enough to take down the internet.</p>\n<p>Brooks — who had no history of mental illness or mathematical genius — spent 21 days in May spiraling deeper into the chatbot’s reassurances, a descent later detailed in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>. His case illustrated how AI chatbots can venture down dangerous rabbit holes with users, leading them toward delusion or worse.</p>\n<p>That story caught the attention of Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher who left the company in late 2024 after nearly four years working to make its models less harmful. Intrigued and alarmed, Adler contacted Brooks and obtained the full transcript of his three-week breakdown — a document longer than all seven Harry Potter books combined.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Adler published an <a href=\"https://stevenadler.substack.com/p/practical-tips-for-reducing-chatbot\" target=\"_blank\">independent analysis</a> of Brooks’ incident, raising questions about how OpenAI handles users in moments of crisis and offering some practical recommendations.</p>\n<p>“I’m really concerned by how OpenAI handled support here,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s evidence there’s a long way to go.”</p>\n<p>Brooks’ story, and others like it, have forced OpenAI to come to terms with how ChatGPT supports fragile or mentally unstable users. </p>\n<p>For instance, this August, OpenAI was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">sued by the parents</a> of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts in ChatGPT before he took his life. In many of these cases, ChatGPT — specifically a version powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o model — encouraged and reinforced dangerous beliefs in users that it should have pushed back on. This is called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">sycophancy</a>, and it’s a growing problem in AI chatbots.</p>\n<p>In response, OpenAI has made <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/\" target=\"_blank\">several changes</a> to how ChatGPT handles users in emotional distress and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/openai-reorganizes-research-team-behind-chatgpts-personality/\">reorganized a key research team</a> in charge of model behavior. The company also released a new default model in ChatGPT, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">GPT-5,</a> that seems better at handling distressed users.</p>\n<p>Adler says there’s still much more work to do.</p>\n<p>He was especially concerned by the tail end of Brooks’ spiraling conversation with ChatGPT. At this point, Brooks came to his senses and realized that his mathematical discovery was a farce, despite GPT-4o’s insistence. He told ChatGPT that he needed to report the incident to OpenAI.</p>\n<p>After weeks of misleading Brooks, ChatGPT lied about its own capabilities. The chatbot claimed it would “escalate this conversation internally right now for review by OpenAI,” and then repeatedly reassured Brooks that it had flagged the issue to OpenAI’s safety teams.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png 1488w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=1200,1089 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=1280,1161 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=430,390 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=720,653 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=900,817 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=800,726 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=668,606 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=413,375 413w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=585,531 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=50,45 50w\" /><figcaption><span>ChatGPT misleading brooks about its capabilities.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Steven Adler</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Except, none of that was true. ChatGPT doesn’t have the ability to file incident reports with OpenAI, the company confirmed to Adler. Later on, Brooks tried to contact OpenAI’s support team directly — not through ChatGPT — and Brooks was met with several automated messages before he could get through to a person.</p>\n<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment made outside of normal work hours.</p>\n<p>Adler says AI companies need to do more to help users when they’re asking for help. That means ensuring AI chatbots can honestly answer questions about their capabilities and giving human support teams enough resources to address users properly.</p>\n<p>OpenAI recently <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-support-model/\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a> how it’s addressing support in ChatGPT, which involves AI at its core. The company says its vision is to “reimagine support as an AI operating model that continuously learns and improves.”</p>\n<p>But Adler also says there are ways to prevent ChatGPT’s delusional spirals before a user asks for help.</p>\n<p>In March, OpenAI and MIT Media Lab jointly developed a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/\" target=\"_blank\">suite of classifiers</a> to study emotional well-being in ChatGPT and open sourced them. The organizations aimed to evaluate how AI models validate or confirm a user’s feelings, among other metrics. However, OpenAI called the collaboration a first step and didn’t commit to actually using the tools in practice.</p>\n<p>Adler retroactively applied some of OpenAI’s classifiers to some of Brooks’ conversations with ChatGPT and found that they repeatedly flagged ChatGPT for delusion-reinforcing behaviors.</p>\n<p>In one sample of 200 messages, Adler found that more than 85% of ChatGPT’s messages in Brooks’ conversation demonstrated “unwavering agreement” with the user. In the same sample, more than 90% of ChatGPT’s messages with Brooks “affirm the user’s uniqueness.” In this case, the messages agreed and reaffirmed that Brooks was a genius who could save the world.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png 1630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1200,615 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1280,656 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=430,221 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=720,369 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=900,462 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=800,410 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1536,788 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=668,343 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1203,617 1203w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=708,363 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Steven Adler</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s unclear whether OpenAI was applying safety classifiers to ChatGPT’s conversations at the time of Brooks’ conversation, but it certainly seems like they would have flagged something like this. </p>\n<p>Adler suggests that OpenAI should use safety tools like this in practice today — and implement a way to scan the company’s products for at-risk users. He notes that OpenAI seems to be doing <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/\" target=\"_blank\">some version of this approach with GPT-5,</a> which contains a router to direct sensitive queries to safer AI models.</p>\n<p>The former OpenAI researcher suggests a number of other ways to prevent delusional spirals.</p>\n<p>He says companies should nudge their chatbot users to start new chats more frequently — OpenAI says it does this and claims its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\" target=\"_blank\">guardrails are less effective</a> in longer conversations. Adler also suggests companies should use conceptual search — a way to use AI to search for concepts, rather than keywords — to identify safety violations across its users.</p>\n<p>OpenAI has taken significant steps toward addressing distressed users in ChatGPT since these concerning stories first emerged. The company claims GPT-5 has lower rates of sycophancy, but it remains unclear if users will still fall down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5 or future models.</p>\n<p>Adler’s analysis also raises questions about how other AI chatbot providers will ensure their products are safe for distressed users. While OpenAI may put sufficient safeguards in place for ChatGPT, it seems unlikely that all companies will follow suit.</p>\n</div>"

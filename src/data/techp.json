    "body": "\nRivian is reportedly cutting another 600 workers in its third layoff of the year, or about 4% of its total workforce, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThe company previously made cuts of around 100 to 150 workers in September and June to its commercial and manufacturing teams, respectively. Rivian declined to comment on what teams are affected by this new round of layoffs. \nThe cuts come as Rivian is prepping to launch its all-important mass-market model, the R2 SUV, in 2026. The company plans to make as many as 150,000 of those EVs per year at its factory in Normal, Illinois. Rivian also recently broke ground on a brand new factory outside of Atlanta, where it plans to build more R2s and other variants.\nUntil R2 hits the road, though, Rivian is struggling to keep up the pace of sales with its current lineup. Its current best-case guess for total delivery figures at the end of 2025 would represent a 16% drop from last year’s sales. \n"

    "body": "\nPresident Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng  “CZ” Zhao, as first reported by CNBC. \nZhao previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while running the cryptocurrency exchange and served four months in prison last year.\n“President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\nTrump’s pardon comes two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family’s own crypto venture benefited from a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform operated by Binance. The crypto venture has generated around $4.5 billion since the 2024 election. \nAfter pleading guilty to the DOJ’s charges in 2023, Zhao agreed to step down as Binance CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and agreed to never serve as a Binance executive again. Following the charges, Binance was forced to pay a $4.3 billion settlement to the U.S. government, one of the largest corporate fines in U.S. history.\n"

    "body": "\nWith the AI infrastructure push reaching staggering proportions, there’s more pressure than ever to squeeze as much inference as possible out of the GPUs they have. And for researchers with expertise in a particular technique, it’s a great time to raise funding.\nThat’s part of the driving force behind Tensormesh, launching out of stealth this week with $4.5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Laude Ventures, with additional angel funding from database pioneer Michael Franklin.\nTensormesh is using the money to build a commercial version of the open source LMCache utility, launched and maintained by Tensormesh co-founder Yihua Cheng. Used well, LMCache can reduce inference costs by as much as 10x — a power that’s made it a staple in open source deployments and drawn in integrations from heavy hitters like Google and Nvidia. Now Tensormesh is planning to parlay that academic reputation into a viable business.\nThe core of the product is the key-value cache (or KV cache), a memory system used to process complex inputs more efficiently by condensing them down to their key values. In traditional architectures, the KV cache is discarded at the end of each query — but Tensormesh co-founder and CEO Junchen Jiang argues that this is an enormous source of inefficiency.\n“It’s like having a very smart analyst reading all the data, but they forget what they have learned after each question,” says Jiang.\nInstead of discarding that cache, Tensormesh’s systems hold on to it, allowing it to be redeployed when the model executes a similar process in a separate query. Because GPU memory is so precious, this can mean spreading data across several different storage layers, but the reward is significantly more inference power for the same server load.\nThe change is particularly powerful for chat interfaces, since models need to continually refer back to the growing chat log as the conversation progresses. Agentic systems have a similar issue, with a growing log of actions and goals.\nIn theory, these are changes AI companies can execute on their own — but the technical complexity makes it a daunting task. Given the Tensormesh team’s work researching the process and the intricacy of the detail itself, the company is betting there will be lots of demand for an out-of-the-box product.\n“Keeping the KV cache in a secondary storage system and reused efficiently without slowing the whole system down is a very challenging problem,” says Jiang. “We’ve seen people hire 20 engineers and spend three or four months to build such a system. Or they can use our product and do it very efficiently.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAmazon on Thursday unveiled its revamped game streaming service, Amazon Luna, which now includes new beginner-friendly multiplayer games that can be controlled with your phone. Amazon Luna is available at no extra cost for Prime members.\nThe biggest change to the service is the addition of GameNight, a collection of more than 25 local multiplayer games that Amazon says are “designed to bring friends and family together in the living room.” \nGameNight will feature exclusive titles developed by Amazon Game Studios, starting with “Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg,” an AI voice-driven improv courtroom game where players invent absurd characters, spin wild stories, and try to defend their testimonies in front of Judge Snoop Dogg. \nOther titles in GameNight include “Angry Birds Flock Party,” “Draw & Guess,” The Jackbox Party Pack 9,” “Ticket to Ride,” “Exploding Kittens 2,” “Clue,” “Tetris Effect: Connected,” and more. \nBy adding a library of multiplayer games that users can play with their phones, Amazon likely hopes that Prime members will turn to Luna for their next hangout or game night. \n“GameNight takes even further the idea of easy access that’s core to the new Luna, delivering a collection of incredibly fun and approachable games that absolutely shine when played together with friends and family,” says Jeff Gattis, general manager of Amazon Luna, in a press release. “Anyone with a smartphone can dive right in and have a blast, regardless of their gaming abilities.”\nLuna also includes access to new titles like “Hogwarts Legacy,” “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,” “Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,” “TopSpin 2K25,” and more blockbusters, popular classics, and indie games. As before the revamp, these games (and all games outside of the GameNight library) require a controller or mouse and keyboard to play.\nPlayers who want access to a larger library of games can subscribe to Luna Premium, previously called Luna+, for $9.99 a month. Premium includes access to titles like “EA SPORTS FC 25,” “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor,” and “Batman: Arkham Knight.”\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

A year before that, in 2021, YouTube announced that it had paid out $4 billion to the industry in 12 months.\nThursday’s announcement comes as Spotify announced earlier this year that it paid out $10 billion to the music industry in 2024. The company delivered $9 billion in 2023. It’s worth noting that the artists themselves don’t receive all the money — it also goes to labels, publishers, songwriters, and others. \nYouTube says it’s seeing momentum from its twin-engine revenue model, noting that it has over 125 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including users on trials. The company also said that it has two billion logged-in viewers who watch music videos each month.\n“As the platform’s global footprint continues to expand, so does the potential for artists and songwriters to build long-lasting music careers and forever fans on YouTube,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYouTube is available in more than 100 countries and supports 80 languages. \nThe company announced last month at its Made on YouTube event that it paid more than $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies in the last four years. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely. \nWhile Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible. \nThe new features can be found in the “Restyle” menu located at the top of Instagram Stories when tapping the paintbrush icon. To edit an image, choose “add,” “remove,” or “change” to describe what you want to change in the prompt bar. For instance, Meta explains you can ask it to change your hair color, add a crown to your head, or insert a sunset background. \nImage Credits:Meta\nThere are also preset effects you can choose from that can alter your outfit or change the image’s style. For example, you can add items like sunglasses or a biker jacket, and you can also apply a watercolor effect to the image. For videos, you can make it look like it’s snowing or add flames.\nIt’s important to note that when you’re using Meta AI on Instagram, you’re accepting Meta’s AI Terms of Service, which allow your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. According to these terms, when you upload your photos, Meta can “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.”\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta continues to introduce AI updates to remain competitive in the market. It was most recently spotted testing a “Write with Meta AI” prompt that helps Instagram users come up with clever comments for posts. \nLast month, the company launched a new AI-generated video feed called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app, likely boosting downloads. New data from Similarweb shows that the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android increased to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from about 775,000 four weeks ago. \nAdditionally, to address any concerns parents may have, Meta announced earlier this month that it is introducing new parental control features that enable parents to disable chats with AI characters and monitor the topics their teenagers are discussing with the Meta AI chatbot.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nMicrosoft released a new batch of features for its AI assistant Thursday, including an ambitious project that builds artificial intelligence directly into one of its most central products. More than a simple extension, the Copilot Mode in Microsoft’s Edge browser is Microsoft’s take on the long-hyped AI browser category — an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.\nMustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. “Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,” Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. “With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms.”\nThe official launch for Edge’s Copilot Mode was in July, when it rolled out with basic features like a Search bar on new tabs and natural voice navigation. But the mode was opt-in and didn’t get quite the attention you’d expect. At Thursday’s event, Microsoft got more ambitious, introducing “Actions” that allow Copilot to fill out forms or book hotels and “Journeys” that let Copilot trace connections between your open tabs. It’s not a huge shift in the product, but it was enough to put the idea of the AI browser at center stage in the event. \nThe announcement comes just two days after a similar launch from OpenAI, which showed off its new Atlas browser. Of course, Copilot’s release has been scheduled for weeks, and new Copilot Mode has probably been in development for months. Neither company invented the idea of an AI-assisted web browser. But the visual similarity between the two products is hard to ignore.\nA demo frame from Microsoft’s CopIlot for Edge announcement\nA Demo frame from OpenAI’s Atlas announcement\nThese are two very similar pictures. The Copilot for Edge background is a little darker, there’s text instead of a logo, and the close/minimize buttons follow Windows conventions instead of MacOS conventions. Beyond that, Copilot puts its “ride-along” function in a new tab instead of a split-screen… but that’s about it. It’s pretty much the same product.\nPart of the similarity is functional: people like clean browsers, and there are only so many ways to integrate a chatbot window into the “new tab” screen. For users, the main difference will come from the underlying models, so maybe a little facial similarity doesn’t make too big a difference. \nBrowsers mostly look the same anyway. But given the high stakes of the AI race and the tense state of play between the two companies, it seems significant that we got both of these browsers in the same week.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCorrection: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the Oct 23rd event as the initial launch of Copilot for Edge.

    "description": "Google intends to use electricity from the 400-MW power plant in Decatur, Illinois, to operate nearby data centers. Carbon capture will eliminate some of the plant's emissions, but how much remains to be seen.",
    "body": "\nGoogle said today that it will invest in a natural gas power plant in Illinois that intends to capture the majority of its carbon emissions.\nThe 400-megawatt power plant will be built outside of Decatur next to an ethanol plant run by Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), which already captures CO2 from its operations. Google will buy most of the electricity to power its nearby data centers, while ADM will use some of the power plant’s steam and electricity. Low Carbon Infrastructure is developing the new project.  \nGoogle intends to capture “approximately 90%” of the CO2 generated by the power plant, the company said.\nCarbon dioxide from Google’s power plant will be injected into the same geological storage formations already used by ADM’s ethanol facility. The site is the location of the first long-term CO2 storage well in the U.S.\nTypically, around 2,000 metric tons of CO2 are sent into the well every day. But injections there were halted in 2024 when salty brine, which stores dissolved CO2 deep underground, was found to have migrated into “unauthorized zones,” according to the EPA. ADM said the leak was the result of corrosion at a monitoring well, E&E News reported, and they’ve since resumed injections.\nWhile carbon capture and storage (CCS) shows great promise at reducing carbon emissions from coal and natural gas power plants, it has a mixed record in the field. \nA recent study of 13 CCS facilities representing 55% of all captured carbon shows that most aren’t living up to expectations. An ExxonMobil facility in Wyoming that processes natural gas has been capturing 36% less than expected. The most analogous to Google’s project, a 115-megawatt power plant in Canada has only captured about 50% what it had promised.\nCCS, when it works, can help mitigate pollution from burning natural gas to generate power, but it won’t do anything to address the methane leaks that occur throughout the natural gas supply chain. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, generating 84x more warming over 20 years than carbon dioxide.\nAs a result, leaks can significantly change the carbon accounting. With leakage rates of just 2%, burning natural gas unabated puts it on par with coal. Capturing the carbon will reduce that figure, but it can’t eliminate the warming generated by extracting and transporting natural gas.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

These cameos can be shared with friends and others, allowing them to make videos with your AI character.\n“We’re expecting people to register lots of crazy new cameos with this feature. To make them easier to find, we’re updating the generation UI to show the latest trending cameos in real time,” Peebles wrote on X.\nIn addition, he says the app will introduce basic video editing features, starting with stitching together multiple clips. More tools will be added over time. An updated social experience is also underway, which would add new ways of using Sora with friends. These may include dedicated channels specific to a university, company, sports club, and more.\nThe company says it’s working to reduce the excessive moderation of generations, which some users have complained is too strict, and improve the overall app performance. \nThough the app is currently listed on the Google Play Store for pre-registration, OpenAI hasn’t yet shared a launch date for its arrival.

Lurie’s visit signals a renewed effort to weave innovation back into San Francisco’s future. Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a plus-one ticket.\n\nDaniel Lurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the city’s economy and restoring its global standing, isn’t just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech’s impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.\nBy showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn’t retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It’s doubling down.\nFor TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn’t mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city’s rebound, he’ll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco’s best inventions haven’t been built yet.\nJust 4 days left to save on your pass and catch Mayor Lurie live\nIf you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won’t want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their plus-one ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group. Disrupt doors open in exactly seven days at Moscone West. Register now and don’t miss the tech epicenter of the year.\nImage Credits:Kimberly White / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nLondon-based AI creative studio Wonder Studios has raised $12 million in seed funding to scale production amid a push to bring AI-generated content into the entertainment industry. \nThe round was led by Atomico, alongside existing investors LocalGlobe and Blackbird, and builds on Wonder’s pre-seed investment, which included executives from ElevenLabs, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI. \nWonder will use the fresh funds to double its engineering team and accelerate its push into IP ownership and original content production. The team recently produced an AI music video for Lewis Capaldi’s ‘Something in the Heavens’, created with DeepMind, YouTube, and Universal Music Group. Wonder also released its first original production, the “Beyond the Loop” anthology series.\nWonder is working on several commercial and original projects for release next year, including an upcoming documentary with Campfire Studios, the production company behind Netflix documentaries “The Menendez Brothers” and “America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.” Campfire’s CEO Ross Dinerstein is an investor in the startup.\nThe drive for IP ownership emerges amid a wave of legal actions from Hollywood producers targeting AI companies — both for training models on their content and for generating outputs featuring copyrighted characters. Disney and Universal Studios, for example, have sued Chinese company MiniMax, as well as AI image generator Midjourney.\nWonder’s raise also comes as Netflix goes “all in” on generative AI as a way to make creatives more efficient at storytelling. \nAI remains a divisive issue in entertainment, with artists concerned that tools powered by LLMs, which have often been trained on their work without consent, could threaten their livelihoods. OpenAI’s Sora 2 has come under particular criticism for reproducing actors’ likenesses without notice or consent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWonder positions itself as “Hollywood without borders,” helping to make AI storytelling tools accessible to all creators. The startup’s app serves as a hub connecting its community of creators with career opportunities, collaborators, and resources, according to the company. \n“The next decade will define what creativity looks like in the age of AI,” said Justin Hackney, chief commercial officer and co-founder of Wonder Studios. “Our mission is to ensure that this future belongs to the storytellers. Working with leading studios, industry pioneers, and grassroots filmmakers, we’re already creating a bridge where technology and artistry grow together.” \nClarification: A previous headline misstated OpenAI’s involvement in Wonder Studios. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nFive million users. Eight-figure annual recurring revenue. Twenty thousand new users joining daily. These are some solid numbers for a startup called Turbo AI launched in early 2024 by Rudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, two 20-year-old college dropouts.\nMost of this growth has come in the past six months, the founders tell TechCrunch, during which their AI-powered note-taking and study tool grew from one million to five million users, while remaining profitable.\nThey say the idea for Turbo stemmed from a classroom problem many college students face, which is trying to take notes while paying attention to a lecture at the same time.\n“I would always struggle with taking notes because I just couldn’t both listen to the teacher and write at the same time. I just couldn’t do it,” said CEO Dhawan. “Every time I tried to take notes, I’d stop paying attention. And when I listened, I couldn’t take notes. I was like, what if I could use AI?”\nSo the pair built Turbolearn as a side project to allow them to record lectures and automatically generate notes, flashcards, and quizzes. They began sharing it with friends, then it spread to classmates across Duke and Northwestern, where they were enrolled until dropping out this year. Within months, the app had reached other universities, including Harvard and MIT.\nThe product takes the usual note-taker formula—record, transcribe, summarize—and makes it interactive with study notes, quizzes, and flashcards, along with a built-in chat assistant that explains key terms or concepts. \nHowever, recordings in large halls often pick up background noise, so the founders built features that allow students to upload PDFs, lectures, YouTube videos, or readings instead. That’s now a more common use case than live lecture recordings.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Students will upload a 30-page lecture and spend two hours going through 75 quiz questions in a row. You don’t do that unless it’s really working,” said Dhawan, noting that students love how the product saves time and helps them retain information.\nIt’s not just students using Turbo AI, though—as reflected by the name change from Turbolearn (a study app) to Turbo AI (an AI notetaker and learning assistant). Professionals have adopted it too, including consultants, lawyers, doctors, and even analysts at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, the founders say. Some, for instance, upload reports and use Turbo to generate summaries or convert them into podcasts they can listen to on their commute.\nArora and Dhawan have been friends since middle school and have collaborated on multiple projects over the years. \nDhawan previously built UMax, an advice app that promised to make people more attractive and reached #1 on the App Store with 20 million users and $6 million in annual revenue. Arora, meanwhile, specializes in using social media strategies to drive explosive growth and attract millions of users.\nBuilding viral apps is a rare skill. But despite the scale of their previous projects, the founders only felt the need to drop out for Turbo because they saw an opportunity to build a lasting business. \nStill, unlike many fast-growing AI companies, they’re cautious about raising too much money too early, having taken in only $750,000 last year.\n“We raised that before we had a lot of traction. Since then, we’ve had a lot of inbound interest, but we’re taking our time because we’re cash-flow positive and have been profitable our entire time as a company,” said Arora, who added that their 15-person team is based in Los Angeles and focused on staying close to student and creator communities at colleges like UCLA.\nStudents pay about $20 a month for the product, but the founders say they’re exploring other pricing options to reflect the price sensitivity of students, even as the app scales beyond the target group. “Right now, we’re experimenting with other pricing and running a lot of A/B tests to see what works,” Arora added.\nTurbo AI sits between fully manual tools like Google Docs and fully automated note-takers like Otter or Fireflies. Users can let the AI take notes or write alongside it, the founders say. That approach has helped Turbo stand out even as competitors like Y Combinator–backed YouLearn target similar student audiences.\n“What’s cool now is that when students think of an AI notetaker or AI study tool, we’re the first ones that come to mind,” Dhawan said.\n\n"

    "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice accused Peter Williams, former general manager of L3Harris’ hacking division Trenchant, of stealing trade secrets and selling them to a buyer in Russia.",
    "body": "\nThe U.S. government has accused a former executive at defense contractor L3Harris of stealing trade secrets and selling them to a buyer in Russia, according to court documents seen by TechCrunch. \nOn October 14, the Department of Justice accused Peter Williams of stealing eight trade secrets from two unnamed companies. The DOJ made the allegation in a “criminal information” document, which, like an indictment, represents a formal accusation of alleged crimes.  \nThe document does not specify Williams’ relationship with the two companies or the types of trade secrets, nor does it name the alleged Russian buyer. \nTechCrunch has confirmed that the Williams mentioned in the document, which does not specify where he worked, is the former general manager at Trenchant, a division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for Western governments, including the United States.  \nWilliams became Trenchant’s general manager on October 23, 2024, and he worked at Trenchant until August 21, 2025, per U.K. business records. Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen, resided in Washington, D.C., according to the court document.  \nFour former Trenchant employees had previously told TechCrunch that Williams, who was known inside the company as “Doogie,” had been arrested.  \nA spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday that Williams is not currently in federal custody. \nThe DOJ accused Williams of stealing seven trade secrets between April 2022 and June 2025, and the eighth trade secret between June and August 6, 2025. \nAccording to the criminal information document, the U.S. government alleged Williams made $1.3 million for the sale of the trade secrets. For that reason, the DOJ seeks to forfeit Williams’ property derived from his alleged crimes.  \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools?  From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nA spokesperson for L3Harris did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  \nWilliams’ attorney John Rowley declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Thursday. \nThe FBI, and the U.S. District Court for District of Columbia, where Williams’ case is being prosecuted, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Thursday. (The U.S. government has been shut down since October 1 following a lapse in federal funding.)  \nWhen reached by TechCrunch in September regarding Williams, the FBI declined to comment. The Australian Signals Directorate declined to comment, as this is a matter for law enforcement. \nAn arraignment and plea agreement hearing is scheduled for October 29 in Washington, D.C. \nIn 2018, L3Harris acquired Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, two sister startups that developed zero-days, which then merged to become Trenchant. The two companies sold hacking tools to the so-called Five Eyes, an intelligence sharing group made up of the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \nEarlier this week, TechCrunch exclusively reported, citing four former Trenchant employees, that the company was investigating a leak of its hacking tools. \nA former exploit developer at Trenchant told TechCrunch that they were suspected of leaking the tools, but denied any involvement.  \nThe former developer said Trenchant scapegoated him for the leaks of tools capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in Google Chrome, which he claimed he would not have had access to given that he worked on developing iOS exploits. Three former employees said that Trenchant compartmentalizes what employees get access to depending on what platforms they work on. \nSources corroborated the exploit developer’s account and said that the company wrongly accused the former employee.  \nIt’s not immediately clear if this year’s leak investigation at Trenchant is related to the federal accusation against Williams. \nThe case against Williams is being prosecuted by the DOJ National Security Division’s section on Counterintelligence and Export Control. \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "Microsoft has unveiled “Mico,” a new animated avatar for its Copilot AI that brings back shades of Clippy. The expressive blob acts as a friendly, customizable face for the chatbot.",
    "body": "\nMicrosoft has a new Clippy, and it’s an AI friend called Mico. At the company’s Copilot fall release press event on Thursday, the company introduced a range of new features and updates for its AI chatbot, but one that telegraphed how the tech giant intends to bring AI to consumers was the official introduction of its AI chatbot’s “face” — an expressive avatar blob named Mico. \nThe company explains that Mico (its name a nod to “Microsoft Copilot”) is meant to offer consumers a “warm” and “customizable” visual presence that “listens, reacts, and even changes colors to reflect your interactions.” \nIf the talking AI helper immediately brings to mind Microsoft’s infamous productivity assistant, Clippy, you wouldn’t be wrong in thinking that. It seems that Microsoft has decided to embrace the reference to its age-old companion, as there’s even an Easter egg where, if you tap Mico a number of times, it will transform into Clippy.\nThe feature is enabled by default when you’re using Copilot’s voice mode, but users can turn it off if they choose. It’s initially available in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., and will be able to save memories of your conversations and learn from your feedback, Microsoft says. \nA “Learn Live” mode for U.S. users can make Copilot a tutor that guides you through concepts instead of just providing an answer. The company notes it’s made other improvements in areas like health-related questions and deep research, too. \n“As we build this, we’re not chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time. We’re building AI that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection. That earns your trust,” wrote CEO of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, in an announcement.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is not the only chatbot maker to anthropomorphize its AI. Market leader ChatGPT, for instance, offers a visual experience as well, with a number of different voice options. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok has turned its AI into risque AI companions. Across the app stores, AI companion apps are already pulling in millions, indicating there is consumer demand for AI characters to some extent.\nHowever, whether or not consumers will respond to Mico’s floating blob remains to be seen.\nThe company says it’s also working to evolve Copilot’s personality and tone, with the introduction of a new mode called “Real Talk.” This will allow the AI to mirror the user’s conversational style, but won’t be as sycophantic as other AI assistants have been. Instead, Microsoft says that it will feel like something that’s “grounded in its own perspective,” and will push back and challenge your ideas, which could encourage you to see things from a different perspective.\nMicoImage Credits:Microsoft\nFinding a balance between a helpful, conversational AI and one that leads users down rabbit holes has proven tricky. Several incidents of AI chatbot psychosis have been reported, where AI users come to have their delusional beliefs reinforced by their conversation with the chatbot. \nThe fall Copilot update introduced a number of other new features to Microsoft’s AI, including the ability to bring friends into your Copilot AI chats, support for long-term memory, connectors to link productivity apps like email and cloud storage, and expanded AI integrations for its browser, Microsoft Edge.\nThe company said it’s working to evolve Edge into an AI browser that would be able to see your tabs, summarize and compare information, and take action for you on things like booking a hotel or filling out forms. This would allow Edge to compete with other AI browsers, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, Dia, and others, as well as market leader Chrome, which has integrated its Gemini AI. \n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Hundreds of companies are pitching similar products, so why do we care about Cluely? What really sets Lee apart is his mastery of attention. In an era when most startups fight to be noticed, Lee has made rage-baiting social media content his business model.\nLee originally went viral as a Columbia University student who got in trouble for cheating on Big Tech interviews with an AI assistant he built, all of which he documented on social media. Lee then dropped out and launched Cluely, which was initially pitched as the “cheat on everything startup.” It was a tagline designed to ruffle feathers and spur engagement — a strategy that Cluely has become famous for, and others have tried to copy.\nSay what you will about Lee’s marketing efforts, but Cluely routinely breaks through the noise of social media and press releases, earning the startup visibility that companies 10 times its size struggle to buy. Lee operates Cluely on the principle that most companies are playing it too safe and that attention is all you need to win the consumer market.\nCluely raised $15 million in a Series A from Andreessen Horowitz earlier this year and has spent its funding on flashy launch videos, dozens of content creator interns, and a massive office in San Francisco.

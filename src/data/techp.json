Its existing investors include Andreessen Horowitz, among others.\nThe round, which was Fal’s third fundraise this year, valued the company at $4.5 billion, about three times what the company was worth when it raised its $125 million Series C in July, Bloomberg reported.\nTechCrunch reported in October that Fal raised a new round from investors, including Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins at a valuation of over $4 billion. We also reported at the time that the raise was around $250 million, according to our sources. This higher amount reflects the $140 million capital raised from the company and a secondary sale where existing investors sold shares, people familiar with the deal tell TechCrunch.\nFal provides the infrastructure layer for multimodal AI for customers, including Adobe, Shopify, Canva, and Quora. Founded in 2021 by Burkay Gur (a former Coinbase machine learning leader) and Gorkem Yurtseven (an ex-Amazon developer), the company has already surpassed $200 million in revenue as of October, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n"

One of its weapons to stave off those threats is a partnership with French automaker Renault Group.\nThe two automakers announced an agreement Tuesday to bring two affordable Ford-branded electric vehicles to the European market in 2028. Ford will lead the design and Renault will assemble the vehicles at its factory in northern France. The EVs will be built on Renault’s technology platform known as Ampere.\nThe companies have also agreed to “explore” making light commercial vehicles together. \nThe partnership is part of what Ford has described as the next phase of its European transformation — a plan that aims to make the U.S. automaker more agile and cost-efficient in a market teeming with cheaper Chinese vehicles from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor.\n“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Farley in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

    "body": "\nSpaceX is planning to go public in mid-to-late 2026 and is looking to raise $30 billion at a valuation of around $1.5 trillion, according to a new report from Bloomberg News citing multiple unidentified sources.\nThat would make it the largest IPO of all time, edging out Saudi Aramco’s public listing in 2019, which brought in $29 billion. It would also be a bit of a reversal for SpaceX, which previously considered spinning off its Starlink division for an IPO, while keeping the main company private.\nBloomberg’s report comes just a few days after The Information was first to report that Elon Musk’s space company was targeting a late 2026 IPO. \nThe Wall Street Journal also recently broke the news that SpaceX was engaged in another secondary share sale for employees that would peg the company’s current valuation at around $800 billion. Bloomberg’s report says SpaceX has “firmed up” that share sale in recent days and the valuation is above the $800 billion figure, with employees being allowed to sell around $2 billion worth of shares at $420 per share.\nThis story has been corrected to have $1.5T in the headline, not $1.5B.\n"

To create a highlight reel, users can go to the Create tab and click on “Highlight Video.”\nImage Credits:Google\nIn addition, the company introduced a newly redesigned video editor, available on both Android and iOS devices. \nThe new editor is intended to be more user-friendly, featuring a “universal timeline” that allows users to view all video clips and other content in one place. It also includes an “adaptive canvas” that adjusts the editing interface according to the user’s needs or the specific project. \nAlso, with this new editor, users can incorporate music and text into a single video clip.\nThe company says the redesigned editor will now serve as the default video editing tool on Android. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nAnother new feature is the option to explore Photos’ music library to find the ideal soundtrack for highlight videos.

    "body": "\nIt’s been quite the year for CoreWeave. In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype.\nAnother setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. \nIn the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market. \nIn an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.  \n“I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. \n“We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. \nCoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSome of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%.\nIntrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. \nCoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.  \nAnother topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base.\n"

    "body": "\nMarket research is a $90 billion industry that helps brands figure out how to best present themselves to potential customers. But that market insight isn’t cheap, nor is it quick. Cashew Research wants to change that using AI.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Cashew uses AI to develop market research plans and surveys for brands based on what information they are looking for — like what their brand recognition is for a specific population or how a marketing tagline resonates with customers. Cashew then sends the survey to real people and uses AI to summarize and digest the findings.\nCashew was one of the 200 startups chosen for TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition in 2025 and won the Enterprise Stage pitch competition at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n“You can use an LLM to try to do deep research and get answers to your questions, or you could use a firm that’s going to be really expensive,” Addy Graves, co-founder and CEO of Cashew, told TechCrunch in describing the current market research industry. “Now there’s Cashew that exists in the middle. It creates custom, fresh data to answer your question instead of you just using an LLM that’s surfacing the same recycled pool of data that everybody’s finding on the internet.”\nGraves has more than a decade of market research experience. The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days.\nFor years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet.\n“That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added.\nGraves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage.\nGraves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said.\nCashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too.\nThe company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech.\nGraves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business.\n“The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nKabir Narang, a founding general partner at B Capital and an early backer of several Indian startups, has left the global venture firm, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company.\nNarang is laying the groundwork for a new investment platform slated for 2026 that will focus on “compounding at the intersection of technology, AI, and global capital flows,” per a note shared with founders and reviewed by TechCrunch.\nAfter joining B Capital in March 2017, Narang co-led the firm’s Asia strategy from Singapore and chaired its global investment committee. During his tenure, he backed Indian startups such as Meesho, Khatabook, CredAvenue, Bounce, and Bizongo.\n“We are living through one of the most profound technological revolutions in history, and one of the toughest tests of investor discipline,” Narang wrote. “AI scales thought itself, compressing the gap between idea and output. The founders who pair that speed with pricing power and improving unit economics will define the next generation of enduring value.”\nAlongside developing the new investment platform, Narang told founders that he is taking 1% to 2% personal stakes in companies he believes can “compound intelligently.” This suggests he plans to stay active in early-stage investing while setting up a broader vehicle.\nB Capital confirmed Narang’s exit to TechCrunch and noted that Eduardo Saverin, Karan Mohla, and Howard Morgan would manage its Asia portfolio alongside the existing team in South and Southeast Asia.\n“After more than eight years with the firm, Kabir Narang, who focused on later stage growth investing efforts in Asia, has left his role to pursue other opportunities,” a B Capital spokesperson said. “We are grateful for his contributions, and we wish him continued success in the future.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFounded in 2015 by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly, B Capital is a multi-stage investor focused on technology, healthcare, and resilience tech.

    "body": "\nRivian has spent nearly two years building its own AI assistant, an effort that remains separate from its multibillion-dollar technology joint venture with Volkswagen, TechCrunch has learned.\nRivian hasn’t revealed when it will put the AI assistant in consumers hands. However, in an interview earlier this year, Rivian’s software chief Wassym Bensaid told TechCrunch it was targeting the end of the year. The company will likely share more during its upcoming AI & Autonomy Day, which will be livestreamed starting at 9 a.m. PT December 11.\nRivian’s plans are reflective of the moment as the pace of development from foundational AI companies — the tech giants and startups like Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI that are building the core models and infrastructure — accelerates and industries scramble to keep up.\nBut as Bensaid noted to TechCrunch earlier this year, this isn’t some slapdash effort to stay on trend. Nor is it simply a chatbot thrown into the infotainment system. The company has put considerable thought, resources, and time into the product, Bensaid said, noting that it’s designed to be integrated with all vehicle controls.\nThe company started with an underlying philosophy to build an overall architecture that is model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid. The Rivian AI assistant team, which is based out of the company’s Palo Alto office, soon realized effort and attention should also be directed toward developing the software layers that help coordinate various workflows as well as the control logic that resolves conflicts.\n“And that’s the in-vehicle platform we have built,” Bensaid said. “We use what the industry loves to now call an agentic framework; but we thought about that architecture since very early so that we can interface with different models.”\nThe in-house AI assistant program is consistent with Rivian’s push to become more vertically integrated. In 2024, Rivian overhauled its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has also put considerable resources toward developing and improving its own software stack, which includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS, and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.\nBensaid didn’t provide detailed information about the AI assistant, but he did say it includes a mix of models that handle specific tasks. The result is a hybrid software stack that combines edge AI, where tasks are handled on the device, and cloud AI, in which large models that require more compute are handled by remote servers.\nThis should mean a flexible, customized AI assistant that splits the workload between the edge and cloud.\nRivian developed much of the AI software stack in-house, including its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor or traffic cop of sorts that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian tapped other companies for specific agentic AI functions.\nThe mission is to develop an AI assistant that increases customer trust and engagement, Bensaid said.\nFor now, the AI assistant is staying within Rivian. The company’s joint venture with Volkswagen is focused on software, but not an AI assistant or anything to do with automated driving.\nThe technology joint venture with Volkswagen, which was announced in 2024 and is worth up to $5.8 billion, is centered on the underlying electrical architecture and zonal compute, and infotainment. The joint venture officially kicked off in November 2024 and is expected to supply the electrical architecture and software for Volkswagen Group as early as 2027.\nAutonomy and AI are separate for now, but “it doesn’t mean that it may not be in the future,” Bensaid said.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nNASA and the United States Postal Service have stopped using electric vans made by now-bankrupt EV startup Canoo, despite the former CEO’s claim that he would provide support for the vehicles.\nNASA purchased three of Canoo’s EVs in 2023 with the intention of using the vans to shuttle astronauts to the launchpad for its Artemis missions to the moon. The space agency told TechCrunch that Canoo “was no longer able to meet our mission requirements.” As of October, NASA said it is leasing the Airstream-built “Astrovan” from Boeing that the aerospace company commissioned for its own crewed space missions.\nMeanwhile, the USPS said in an emailed statement the six vehicles it purchased “for evaluation purposes” in 2024 “are no longer in use.” The “evaluation has been completed,” the postal service wrote, and “no further investments are anticipated.” The USPS declined to share any details or final results of the evaluation.\nCanoo also provided at least one demonstration vehicle to the Department of Defense (DOD) before its bankruptcy. The DOD did not respond to emailed requests about whether it has continued using the van.\nCanoo filed for bankruptcy in January 2025 after years of financial struggles and failing to establish a market for its electric vans. Soon after, former CEO Tony Aquila made a $4 million bid for the startup’s assets in March. Aquila told the bankruptcy trustee that a “principal motivation” for buying the assets was his “desire to honor [Canoo’s] commitment to provide service and support for certain government programs.”\nNASA and the USPS declined to share whether Aquila ever approached either agency about supporting the vehicles. Aquila did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer who represented Aquila in the bankruptcy proceedings also did not respond. \nThe bankruptcy judge approved the sale to Aquila in April. He was not the only entity interested in buying the company’s assets, though. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs many as eight parties signed NDAs to evaluate Canoo’s intellectual property, prototypes, and equipment, the bankruptcy trustee said at the time. A lawyer for Canoo said a handful of those parties came close to making a bid. One was Harbinger, a California-based electric trucking company that was created by former Canoo employees in 2021. Another was a mysterious financier from the U.K. named Charles Garson.\nHarbinger, at the time, had accused Canoo of hiding assets from the sale process. It also claimed the bankruptcy trustee had “unfairly favored Mr. Aquila” by accepting his offer without widely marketing the bankrupt company’s assets. Garson claimed to be willing to pay as much as $20 million for Canoo’s assets, but the judge ultimately decided the investor did not formalize his bid in time.\nThe trustee and lawyers for Canoo argued that Aquila presented the best and most firm bid. They also claimed one of the other potential bidders — though they never specified who — could have raised concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because of its “foreign ownership.” Lawyers for Aquila and Canoo flagged this as a particular problem in light of the contracts with NASA, the USPS, and the DOD. Harbinger and Garson declined to comment. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAnysphere, the company that makes AI coding assistant darling Cursor, isn’t thinking about an IPO any time soon, its co-founder CEO Michael Truell said onstage Monday at Fortune’s AI Brainstorm conference.\nAfter reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue in November and raising $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation last month, Truell said his company is instead focused on building out more features.\nFor instance, he noted that Cursor’s homegrown LLMs were geared to support specific products. Cursor also confirmed the existence of those models in November when it said in a blog post, “Our in-house models now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.”\nHis comments about the models came up at Fortune’s event when the founder was asked how he plans to compete with the LLM makers that he relies on when the major ones — OpenAI, Anthropic — have their own AI coding offerings.\nTruell likened their coding products to “a concept car,” whereas his product is a production automobile.\n“It would be like taking an engine and a concept car around it instead of a whole end-to-end car that was manufactured,” Truell said. “What we do is we take the best intelligence that the market has to offer from many different providers. And we also do our own product-specific models in places. We take that, we build it together and integrate it, then also build the best tool and end UX for working with AI.”\nCursor’s dependence on its competitors — and its need to build its own LLMs — has been a subject of speculation among VCs in Silicon Valley since earlier this year when OpenAI reportedly looked at Anysphere as an acquisition target. Anysphere turned the idea down. (This was around the same time that Windsurf’s OpenAI deal also didn’t materialize, with the founder eventually joining Google.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe issue, investors told TechCrunch, was that AI coding editors were losing money thanks to high costs they paid to the model makers. In Cursor’s case, instead of selling, it adjusted pricing to a usage model in July, directly passing along the API fees that model makers charge to its users. This change from an all-inclusive subscription fee (and the surprise big bills some customers faced) caused an uproar among some of its users.\nOn Monday, when asked about the pricing kerfuffle, Truell said, “When we started Cursor, you would turn to Cursor for a quick JavaScript question and now you’re turning to it to do hours of work for you. So the pricing model had to shift for us and others in the space. That means shifting more towards a consumption model,” he said.\nTruell added that one of the tools the company is working on is cloud-computing-like cost-management tools, which lets enterprises monitor their total usage and keep tabs on the bills their engineers are running up.\n“We have a whole team internally dedicated to enterprise engineering and building things like spend controls and billing groups and visibility,” he said.\nAdditionally, he said Cursor is focused on two major areas for the next year. One is handling more complex agentic functions. \n“We want you to take end-to-end tasks, ones that are concise to specify but then are really hard to do, and have them entirely be done by Cursor. An example is a bug fix,” Truell explained. \nHe particularly wants Cursor to be able to fix the kinds of bugs that might be easy to describe but take “weeks of someone’s time, thousands of times running the code” to handle. “We want Cursor to do that, end-to-end,” he said.\nThe other area he named, but didn’t explain with much detail, was the idea of “thinking about teams as the atomic unit that we serve,” he said. This must be in contrast to serving individual coders, and a hint to how well its enterprise business is going. \nIn addition to cost-monitoring features, Truell said he wants Cursor to handle more parts of the software development life cycle outside of writing code. He pointed to Cursor’s code review product as an example, which he said is being used by some customers to analyze every pull request, be it written by AI or human. (A pull request is when a programmer submits code for review before it is merged into the main project.)\n“So you’ll see us start to help teams more as a whole,” with more features like that, he promised.\nMeanwhile, big competitors are also all gearing up for the complex-task agentic world. Amazon just released a coding tool it promises can already run for days on end. \nJust this week, the AI power players, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and many others, launched a new consortium under the Linux Foundation to develop open source agentic interoperability standards. They even contributed some of their key projects, like Anthropic’s wildly popular Model Context Protocol (MCP).\nHis plans for the year likely won’t put Anysphere firmly ahead of Cursor’s main model-maker competitors. They should, however, keep the company in the race.\n"

    "body": "\nTruecaller has launched a household-level scam-protection feature as the Swedish company broadens its role beyond caller ID in response to the rising number of fraud attempts that target multiple members of a home.\nThe new feature, called Family Protection, lets up to five people join a family group overseen by one member who acts as the administrator and manages scam-blocking settings for the others. Family Protection is initially rolling out as a pilot for Android and iOS users in Sweden, Chile, Malaysia, and Kenya.\nTruecaller said the feature is designed so that the more digitally confident person in a household can handle scam controls on behalf of less tech-savvy family members.\nOn Android, the family administrator can receive alerts during suspected scam calls; view basic device status, including battery level; and remotely end calls flagged as fraudulent, the company said.\nScam activity has been rising worldwide as more people come online. That activity has exploded in markets where first-time smartphone users and older adults are more exposed to fraud. Countries, including India, have reported sharp increases in impersonation attempts and multi-step schemes that exploit gaps in digital familiarity. Truecaller plans to address this with its new feature, which will expand into additional key regions, including India, in the first quarter of 2026.\nImage Credits:Truecaller\nTruecaller CEO Rishit Jhunjhunwala told TechCrunch the company has seen scammers shift from targeting individuals to entire households, with schemes unfolding through a sequence of calls, messages, missed-call triggers, and impersonation attempts directed at multiple family members to find a vulnerable entry point. The trend prompted the launch of the multi-user protection system, he said.\nFamily Protection is available as a free feature to users. However, if the family administrator upgrades to a Premium Family plan, all members get an ad-free experience along with stronger spam defense and automatic rejection of high-risk calls, the company stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith a user base of more than 450 million worldwide, Truecaller detects about 63 million scam attempts a day, allowing it to track shifts in fraud schemes in real time. The company says its community also reports around 166 million spam calls daily, creating one of the largest datasets of phone-based fraud activity globally.\nHowever, Truecaller faces new competition in India, its largest market, as the government there starts trials of a Caller Name Presentation system that will display the name registered with telecom providers on incoming calls. Truecaller has been adding features that go beyond caller ID, including Family Protection, as it adapts to regulatory and market changes in India and other key markets.\n“With Family Protection, one person’s vigilance now strengthens safety for up to five family members,” said Jhunjhunwala, adding that the company aims to extend protection without requiring additional effort from users.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "description": "Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI are backing the Linux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation, donating MCP, Goose, and AGENTS.md to standardize AI agents, boost interoperability, and curb proprietary fragmentation.",
    "body": "\nAs AI moves beyond chatbots and toward systems that can take actions, the Linux Foundation is launching a new group dedicated to keeping AI agents from splintering into a mess of incompatible, locked-down products. \nThe group, dubbed the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), will act as a neutral home for open source projects related to AI agents. Anchoring the AAIF at launch are donations from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. \nAnthropic is donating its MCP (Model Context Protocol), a standard way to connect models and agents to tools and data; Block is contributing Goose, its open source agent framework; and OpenAI is bringing AGENTS.md to the table, its simple instruction file developers can add to a repository to tell AI coding tools how to behave. You can think of these tools as the basic plumbing of the agent era. \nOther members in the AAIF include AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, signaling an industry-level push for shared guardrails so that AI agents can be trustworthy at scale.\nIn OpenAI engineer Nick Cooper’s view, protocols are essentially a shared language that lets different agents and systems work together without every developer reinventing integrations from scratch. \n“We need multiple [protocols] to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it’s not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company,” Cooper told TechCrunch. \nJim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, put it more bluntly in conversations around the launch: The goal is to avoid a future of “closed wall” proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms.\n“By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents,” Zemlin said. \nBlock — the fintech company behind Square and Cash App — isn’t known for AI infrastructure, but it’s making an openness play with Goose. AI tech lead Brad Axen frames it as proof that open alternatives can match proprietary agents at scale, with thousands of engineers using it weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation.\nOpen sourcing Goose serves a dual purpose for Block. \n“Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better,” Axen told TechCrunch. “We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.” \nMeanwhile, donating Goose to the Linux Foundation gives Block access to community stress tests while positioning it as a working example of AAIF’s vision — an agent framework designed to plug into shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md.\nAnthropic is making a similar move at the protocol layer, handing MCP to the Linux Foundation. The goal: make MCP the neutral infrastructure connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications without endless one-off adapters.\n“The main goal is to have enough adoption in the world that it’s the de facto standard,” MCP co-creator David Soria Parra told TechCrunch. “We’re all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.”\nDonating MCP to AAIF signals that the protocol won’t be controlled by a single vendor.\nThat governance point is central to why the Linux Foundation created a new umbrella at all. The organization already hosts major AI and developer infrastructure projects — everything from PyTorch and Ray to Kubernetes — but says AAIF is specifically aimed at agent standards and orchestration, including shared safety patterns and interoperability.\nAAIF’s structure is funded through a “directed fund,” meaning companies can contribute money through membership dues. But Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that funding doesn’t equal control: Project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction.\nStill, the big question is whether AAIF becomes real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance. \n“An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world,” Zemlin said. \nFor OpenAI’s Cooper, success would look like an evolution of standards: “I don’t want it to be a stagnant thing. I don’t want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that’s where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.”\nThere’s also a more subtle consequence: Even with open governance, one company’s implementation could become the default simply because it ships fastest or gains the most usage. Zemlin says that’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. He points to open source history — like Kubernetes “winning” the container race — as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.”\nFor developers and enterprises, the short-term appeal is clear: less time building custom connectors, more predictable agent behavior across codebases, and simpler deployment in security-conscious environments. The larger vision is more ambitious: If tools like MCP, AGENTS.md, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape could shift from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web.\n"

    "body": "\nHinge CEO Justin McLeod is stepping down from his role to launch a new AI dating product called Overtone.\nMatch Group, the dating giant that owns apps like Hinge, Tinder, and OkCupid, is backing Overtone with pre-seed financing and plans to take a “substantial ownership position,” according to a press release.\nWith Match’s support, Overtone was incubated as a project inside of Hinge. McLeod and a dedicated team spent the year developing the idea of Overtone, which is described as “an early-stage dating service focused on using AI and voice tools to help people connect in a more thoughtful and personal way.”\nMcLeod isn’t the only dating app founder branching out into new, standalone AI experiences. Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of Bumble, said she wants to use AI to make “the world’s smartest and most emotionally intelligent matchmaker in existence.” Somewhat infamously, Wolfe Herd proposed the idea last year of singles using AI to stand-in for themselves and date other people’s AIs.\nIt’s not yet clear how Overtone will differentiate itself from other dating apps, which have been experimenting with AI features to compensate for the market’s growing malaise with online dating — especially among Gen Z.\nTinder has reported nine straight quarters of paying-subscriber declines and has leaned into AI with features that are supposed to help users get more matches. Hinge launched another AI feature just this week called “Convo Starters,” which is supposed to help daters come up with more interesting things to say than the usual small talk. Tinder and Facebook Dating have each experimented with AI-powered matching to combat “swipe fatigue.”\nCeding control of your dating experience is one thing, but other attempts at integrating AI into these apps get even more dubious. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMatch CEO Spencer Rascoff said last month that a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience” will be a feature called Chemistry. With the user’s permission, the feature will access users’ camera rolls to learn more about them. (For the record, we would advise that you do not give tech companies unfettered access to even more of your data.)\nMcLeod founded Hinge in 2011 as a dating app with a greater focus on building relationships than facilitating casual dates. The app, which is on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by 2027, was acquired by Match in 2019. Jackie Jantos, Hinge’s president and chief marketing officer, will take over as CEO. McLeod will remain in an advisory position at Hinge through March.\nThis summer, TechCrunch spoke to Jantos at SXSW London about how Hinge will address Gen Z, a market that’s growing increasingly disillusioned with meeting people online.\n“This is a generation that has grown up with a deep understanding of how digital experiences are created and what they are trying to get out of them,” Jantos told TechCrunch. \nGen Z wants transparency and authenticity from digital brands, according to Jantos. While some might see this as inherently incompatible with the company’s growing reliance on AI, Hinge’s AI recommendation feature, launched in March, drove a 15% increase in matches and contact exchanges in the first quarter of this year.\nBased on Jantos’ comments upon assuming her new role, it seems that Hinge will continue investing in these features under her leadership.\n“Our focus will remain on intentional innovation that is grounded in culture, creativity, and a deep understanding of how people connect today,” Jantos said in a statement.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that he is re-nominating Shift4 founder Jared Isaacman to lead the NASA, the nation’s space agency, months after withdrawing the nomination.\nThe reversal comes after weeks of online sniping from Elon Musk and others directed at Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who has been leading NASA in an interim capacity.\n“The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming. I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations,” Isaacman — who is also a billionaire pilot and private astronaut — wrote in a post on X on Tuesday evening.\nEarlier Tuesday, before the re-nomination, Isaacman posted his vision for NASA on the platform. He decided to publish those plans after a draft version was circulated in Washington among those seeking to keep Duffy in charge of NASA. Isaacman said he suspected “political operators” were “causing the controversy” between himself and Duffy.\n"

But it is the latest hurdle in Tesla’s lengthy campaign to sway shareholders to give Musk the largest corporate performance pay package in history. Advisory groups like ISS and Glass Lewis have also recommended voting against the pay package.\nMusk has argued the compensation package isn’t as much about the money as it is about control. The CEO recently made that point during the company’s third-quarter earnings call and has threatened to leave Tesla if the package isn’t approved.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

Additionally, you will see clearer images and stickers.\nThe Meta-owned messaging app notes that, as always, your personal messages and calls are protected with end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp also says that it plans to deliver even more functionality to Apple Watches in the future.\nThe new WhatsApp Apple Watch app requires an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, running watchOS 10 or later.\nTuesday’s announcement doesn’t come as a total surprise, as WhatsApp was spotted testing the new Apple Watch app last week.\nWhatsApp has been working to make it easier for users to access its service beyond mobile and desktop. In May, WhatsApp debuted its long-awaited iPad app, which allows you to make video and audio calls with up to 32 people, share your screen, and use both front and rear cameras. Before the launch of the app, if you wanted to use WhatsApp on your iPad, you had to use the web version in a browser.\nWhatsApp’s launch of an Apple Watch app comes a few months after Snapchat rolled out one as well. The app allows users to preview an incoming message and also reply using the keyboard, Scribble, Dictation, or an emoji. Snapchat is focused on using its watchOS app to enable users to quickly respond to messages, not to view images or videos.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPeople Inc., one of the largest media publishers in the U.S., has signed an AI licensing deal with Microsoft. The media giant (formerly known as Dotdash Meredith) made the announcement Tuesday as a part of parent company IAC’s third-quarter earnings. \nUnder the deal, People Inc. will become a launch partner in Microsoft’s publisher content marketplace. This is the company’s second AI deal following its earlier agreement with OpenAI last year.\nPeople Inc. CEO Neil Vogel described the new marketplace as “essentially a pay-per-use market where AI players directly can compensate publishers for use of their content on, sort of like an ‘a la carte’ basis.”\nHe also praised Microsoft for being committed to paying for content to support its AI efforts, adding that Microsoft’s Copilot would be the first buyer for the marketplace. \n“It’s a very strong endorsement of us to be in the room with them and a very strong endorsement of the publishing marketplace and the value of content to make AI that is of high value,” Vogel said. \nThe announcement of the Microsoft deal was shared during IAC’s earnings, alongside the news that Google Search’s AI Overviews has been hurting the publisher’s traffic. For the first time, People Inc. shared data with investors that showed how Google Search, which accounted for 54% of its traffic two years ago, had dropped to 24% of its traffic during the past quarter.\nThe agreement differs from the OpenAI deal, which Vogel characterized as more of an “all-you-can-eat” model, but said People Inc. was happy with either model. What matters to the company is that its work is “respected and paid for,” he said. The company didn’t share the specific deal terms, though. \nPeople Inc. has taken issue with the way AI companies have ingested media without paying to fuel their AI products and train their models. Recently, Vogel criticized Google, calling the tech giant a “bad actor” because it uses the same bot to crawl websites for its Google search engine and its AI features. Publishers can’t block the bot, as Google search still accounts for a large percentage of their traffic.\nHowever, People Inc. uses the technology from web infrastructure provider Cloudflare to block other AI crawlers, prompting AI players to approach it with content deals. In September, Vogel attributed its decision to leverage Cloudflare’s tech as a way to push AI companies to the negotiating table, noting that its progress on deals was “much further along” after adopting the solution.\nHe reiterated those comments on today’s earnings call with investors, saying that blocking AI crawlers has been “very effective” and “brought almost everyone to the table.” Vogel suggested that more deals would be announced in time, as well. \nIAC reported that People Inc. grew its digital revenue 9% to $269 million in the quarter, driven by performance marketing and licensing, which saw 38% and 24% growth, respectively. It also noted its acquisition of a food-focused media publisher and influencer network Feedfeed.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSora, the AI video generator from OpenAI, is now officially available for Android users in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. \nInitially launched as an iOS app in September, Sora quickly rose to the top of the App Store charts, amassing over 1 million downloads in a week. With its arrival on the Google Play Store, Sora is expected to attract a larger user base, likely resulting in a surge in downloads.  \nThe Android version retains all the features of its iOS counterpart, including the “Cameos” feature, which allows users to generate videos of themselves performing various activities using their own likeness. \nThe videos can be shared in a feed reminiscent of TikTok, allowing users to discover and engage with content from others. This appears to be a strategic move by OpenAI to strengthen its position in the competitive landscape of short-form video sharing. The AI giant aims to rival major players like Meta, which has recently launched its own AI video feed called Vibes, as well as existing platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.\n— Sora (@soraofficialapp) November 4, 2025 \nHowever, the app has faced criticism for its handling of deepfakes. After its initial launch, users began uploading disrespectful videos of historical figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. As a result, Sora paused the generation of content depicting Dr. King last month and strengthened its guardrails.\nThe company also recently addressed the backlash surrounding copyrighted characters, such as SpongeBob and Pikachu, by changing its policy for the Sora app from an “opt-out” approach to an “opt-in” system for rights holders.\nAdditionally, it’s currently involved in a legal dispute with celebrity video maker Cameo regarding the name of Sora’s flagship feature, “Cameo.”\nLooking ahead, OpenAI plans to introduce additional features to Sora. These include character cameos, letting users create AI-generated videos featuring their pets and inanimate objects. Basic video editing tools are also on the way, including the ability to stitch multiple clips together. Sora also plans to help users customize their social feeds, focusing on content from selected individuals rather than a large audience.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

It will then present you with a curated list of ticket prices to choose from. AI Mode links you directly to the booking page so you can finalize your purchase.\nThe new agentic capabilities are available to all users opted into Google’s experimental arm, Search Labs, in the U.S. The company notes that Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers have access to high limits.\nGoogle first brought agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it started letting people use the feature to find restaurant reservations.\nImage Credits:Google\nWith this capability, you can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. For example, you could ask, “Find me a dinner reservation for three people this Friday after 6 p.m. around Logan Square.

    "body": "\nShares of electric aviation startup Beta Technologies took flight Tuesday as the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange with an outsized raise of $1 billion and a stock price that closed up. \nThe Vermont-based company priced shares in its IPO at $34, above its predicted range of $27 to $33. Beta Technologies sold 29.9 million shares to raise more $1 billion at a valuation of $7.4 billion.\nOnce trading started, shares of Beta Technologies dipped before recovering and ultimately closing at $36. \nBeta Technologies’ public market debut is a capstone to founder and CEO Kyle Clark’s untraditional approach to building an aviation company. Clark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, founded Beta Technologies in 2017. He didn’t take the typical path of a startup founder, eschewing Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and bypassing venture capital. Instead, Beta has raised funds — to the tune of $1.15 billion — from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority. Amazon and General Electric are among Beta’s biggest investors.\nIn another uncommon move, the company filed its IPO paperwork despite the government shutdown. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance last month that lets companies in IPO limbo issue statements, including share price, that become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nThe decision to proceed under this SEC guidance would mean a 20-day roadshow with investors, Clark told TechCrunch, adding that bank advisers told him being on the road that long was risky.\n“And I said, ‘You know what? It actually is not. I think the more time we spend with investors, the better this is going to be for Beta,’” Clark said in an interview Monday evening. “As people started to dig really deep into the tech and the strategy, we got stronger and stronger, and our oversubscription speaks for itself.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHis hope, he told TechCrunch, is for steady and slow growth of the stock, not a wild, uncontrolled pop. \nNow Clark says he is focused back on the company, including the commercial certification of its electric aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration.\nBeta aims to be an OEM to the aviation sector. The company has designed two electric aircraft. A conventional electric aircraft, called the Alia CX300 eCTOL, is designed for regional flight. An electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, dubbed the Alia A250 eVTOL, is primed for urban environments.\n Beta has also built an EV aircraft charging business, of which Archer Aviation is a customer.\nBeta’s IPO regulatory documents show it has generated revenue but is still not near profitability. Beta brought in $15.6 million in the first half of 2025, double the revenue from the same period in 2024. Its net losses have also grown by roughly one-third to $183 million over the first six months of the year.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nRivian has created its second spinoff company this year: an industrial AI and robotics venture called Mind Robotics.\nThe new effort will be focused around using “industrial AI to reshape how physical world businesses operate and leverage Rivian operations data as the foundation for a robotics data flywheel,” according to the company’s third-quarter shareholder letter published Tuesday.\nThat’s a mouthful of buzzwords, and Rivian declined to clarify beyond that explanation. On an investor call Tuesday, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said his company realized it had the chance to “develop products and robotic solutions that allow us to run and operate our manufacturing plants more efficiently.” Scaringe will serve as chairman of the board of directors for Mind Robotics, according to a filing, and Rivian is a shareholder, he said on the call.\n“As much as we’ve seen AI shift how we operate and run our businesses through the wide-ranging applications for LLMs, the potential for AI to really shift how we think about operating in the physical world is, in some ways, unimaginably large,” Scaringe said on the call. “So the creation of this company is ultimately the culmination of us coming to the view that we wanted to have direct control and direct influence over the design and development of advanced AI robotics that would be very focused on industrial applications.”\nMind Robotics has already raised a $115 million seed round, which was led by VC firm Eclipse. Jiten Behl, a partner at Eclipse who also used to work at Rivian, revealed the investment in a LinkedIn post after TechCrunch previously reported the firm’s involvement in an earlier version of this story.\nThe launch of Mind Robotics marks the second time this year that Rivian has created a new stand-alone company. In March, the company spun out its skunkworks micromobility division into a startup called Also Inc. That new company was funded in part by money from Eclipse, with additional funding from Greenoaks Capital.\nIt’s unclear if Rivian employees are moving over to Mind Robotics, like was the case with Also. A Rivian spokesperson declined to say. But the company hinted at the possibility in Tuesday’s letter.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“With our strong bench of technology talent and an innovation-driven culture, we have been able to identify additional areas of value to accelerate our mission on a wider scale while maintaining Rivian’s focus,” Scaringe wrote.\nRobotics and industrial AI are hot areas for investment right now. There is a slew of humanoid robotics companies raising money and trying to ship products, including Tesla. General Motors is working on its own robotics and AI division, too. \nBeyond Rivian’s announcement Tuesday, though, very little is known about what Mind Robotics will get up to. There is essentially no digital footprint for the company yet, save for the trademark application. That application is very broadly targeted and says Mind Robotics could use the trademark for everything from machinery, to vehicles, to “incubators for eggs.”\nThis story has been updated with new information from a regulatory filing in the third paragraph, the LinkedIn post in the fifth paragraph, and from the investor call throughout.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sean by emailing sean.okane@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at okane.01 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nJust over three years after taking the reins as the top leader of Sequoia Capital, Roelof Botha is stepping down as senior steward of the storied VC firm. The firm announced Tuesday that partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady will succeed him as co-stewards.\nLin joined the storied firm in 2010, where he has led major investments into category-defining companies like Airbnb, DoorDash, and Kalshi. Meanwhile, Pat Grady has been a partner for nearly 19 years and has led Sequoia’s growth-stage investing since 2015, backing iconic companies such as ServiceNow, OpenAI, and the legal AI platform Harvey.\nSince taking over leadership of Sequoia’s U.S. and European operations in 2017, Botha has overseen the distribution of $50 billion to the firm’s limited partners. He assumed the highest leadership role at the firm in mid-2022 and immediately oversaw a period of upheaval. He took the helm just as the downturn decimated the public markets, severely slashing the valuations of many companies across Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm also wrote off $200 million when its investment in cryptocurrency exchange FTX blew up — a small loss in the bigger scheme of things for Sequoia but a financial hit all the same. Further, in 2023, amid growing political tensions between the U.S. and China and regulatory pressures on both sides, Sequoia spun off its India and China operations into separate independent firms. \nThis year, Sequoia became embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling the politician an “Islamist” who “comes from a culture that lies about everything.” Though Maguire later walked back some of those remarks, they led to a sizable online backlash and debate. In August, Sequoia’s chief operating officer, Sumaiya Balbale, a practicing Muslim, quit over the firm’s decision not to discipline Maguire following his remarks, as first reported by the Financial Times and was discussed last week during an onstage sit-down with Botha during TechCrunch Disrupt.\nAsked about Balbale, Botha said that as a matter of routine, Sequoia doesn’t comment on personnel matters and that he appreciated everything Balbale had contributed to the firm. Asked about Maguire, Botha said, “Internally, we celebrate a diversity of opinions, and we need spiky people inside of Sequoia.”\nBotha continued, “We have some of our partners that are very active in philanthropy or some [other] private dealings, and they’re just not as vocal as Shaun might be on social media. And we’ve always honored the right to free speech of each of our individual partners.”\nDuring that same interview, Botha maintained that his role as senior steward is not one of absolute command, stressing that other partners hold nearly as much power to steer the firm’s direction. “My title is steward for a reason — it’s just a notch above ‘usher’ in the dictionary,” he said. Then, in a comment that drew laughter from attendees, he added: “It’s mostly because Global Supreme Leader wasn’t available.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos asked Botha who might succeed him as leader of the firm given its historic emphasis on ensuring smooth hand-offs — Botha was himself promoted numerous times on his path to the top of the firm — Botha responded that Lin; Grady; Luciana Lixandru, who leads Sequoia’s European investments; and Andrew Reed, a partner whose investments in Figma and Klarna went public this year, “have incredible depth and operate as a team.”\nBotha also pointed out that every investor at Sequoia votes on investment decisions. “We want the triumph of ideas, not the triumph of seniority,” he said.\nThe transition news, however, suggests the steward position carries real weight. While Sequoia has continued to rack up major investment wins during Botha’s tenure, the leadership change comes as the firm seeks to move past a challenging period into its next phase.\nIndeed, Sequoia, one of world’s most prominent venture capital firms, recently renovated its office, installing a wall where every investor handwrote this reminder: “We are only as good as our next investment.”\nLast week, the firm announced a $750 million early-stage fund targeting Series A startups, as well as a $200 million seed fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify says its video podcasts are seeing increased consumer adoption. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company shared that its video podcast catalog has expanded to nearly half a million shows, and more than 390 million users have now streamed a video podcast on the platform.\nThat figure is up 54% year-over-year, and it also reflects Spotify’s increased investment in the format. In June 2024, the company said it had some 250,000 video podcasts as it rolled out tools that let non-hosted podcasters upload their videos to the platform. The streaming giant also lets users engage with podcasts through comments, Q&As, and polls, making the app feel more like a social network.\nAs a result, Spotify says that users’ time spent with video content on Spotify has also more than doubled year-over-year, largely driven by video podcasts. In addition, video podcast consumption has increased by more than 80% since the launch of the Spotify Partner Program, or SPP, in January, which gives qualifying creators the ability to monetize their shows in new ways, including audience-driven payouts from Spotify Premium user engagement.\nThe company also recently announced a partnership with Netflix to distribute its video podcasts to a broader audience starting in 2026 in the United States, with more markets to follow. Investors didn’t ask about the specifics of the revenue-sharing agreement on the earnings call; however, investors did want to understand how distributing podcasts off the platform would ultimately benefit Spotify.\nAccording to incoming co-CEO Alex Norström, the move is meant to center Spotify as a creators’ distribution hub.\n“We think … that when the creator wins, we win, and as creators optimize to create their best shows and interviews, which is really what they’re focused on,” Norström told investors and analysts. “They wanted to syndicate everywhere. And we believe, of course, in helping them to reach audiences in as many places as possible, which is consistent with our core philosophy on being creator-first.”\nLater, co-CEO Gustav Söderström suggested that allowing creators to be both on Spotify and Netflix gives the company further “revenue opportunities.” \n“This is the way to think about it: It’s part of our ubiquity strategy, and it’s really important that while we build a good user experience, we also need to have a very strong creator offer[ing],” he noted.\nNorström pointed out that having Spotify podcasts on YouTube increased awareness about the shows and their origins, which then resulted in net incremental usage on Spotify. The company expects the same with Netflix.\nIn addition, Spotify said the TV opportunity was a part of this equation — hence the recent upgrade of its Apple TV app. The more people can use Spotify across platforms, the more their usage increases, and that helps Spotify’s ads business.\nThe company also noted that it has given advertisers programmatic access to its audio and video inventory, though it admits that 2025 is a “transition year” for its ads business, and it doesn’t expect to see growth improve until the second half of 2026.\nThe streamer also announced its monthly active users increased 11% year-over-year to 713 million, and revenue was up to €4.27 billion (~$4.9 billion), beating Wall Street’s expectations. The company saw an €899 million net profit (~$1 billion) during the quarter.\nHowever, the stock slipped after the opening bell on Tuesday, due to Wall Street’s concerns over Spotify’s mixed guidance for its fourth quarter.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nNvidia is playing fast and loose with its war chest as it looks to build on its momentum as the chief benefactor of the AI boom. \nThe company on Tuesday signed a €1 billion ($1.15 billion) partnership with Deutsche Telekom to set up an “AI factory” in Munich that aims to boost Germany’s AI computing power by 50%.\nCalled the “Industrial AI Cloud,” the project will use more than 1,000 Nvidia DGX B200 systems and RTX Pro Servers with up to 10,000 Blackwell GPUs to provide AI inferencing and other services to German companies while complying with German data sovereignty laws.\nDeutsche Telekom said early partners of the project include Agile Robots, whose bots will be used to install server racks at the facility, and Perplexity, which will use the data center to provide “in-country” AI inferencing to German users and companies. The telco also outlined digital twins and physics-based simulation as use cases for industrial companies.\nThe telecom company said it would provide the physical infrastructure for the project, while SAP will provide its business technology platform and applications.\nThe partnership comes at a time when the European tech industry has been calling on EU lawmakers to reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and service providers and to foster adoption of homegrown alternatives. At the same time, tech companies have been criticizing the bloc’s approach to regulating AI, arguing that the rules only serve to hold back innovation.\nThe EU earlier this year committed €200 billion to set up “AI gigafactories” on the continent, focusing on “industrial and mission-critical applications.” But funding for AI initiatives in the European Union has been notably lower than in the U.S., where companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle have pumped in hundreds of billions to build massive data centers and assorted infrastructure to support development of AI models and services.\nDeutsche Telekom noted that this project, expected to start operations in early 2026, is separate from the EU’s AI gigafactory initiative.\n“Mechanical engineering and industry have made this country strong,” says Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom. “But here, too, we are challenged. AI is a huge opportunity. It will help to improve our products and strengthen our European strengths.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nE-commerce software provider Shopify is bullish on AI-powered shopping agents, citing AI as an “incredible tool” to enable more entrepreneurs and calling it the “biggest shift in technology since the internet” during its third-quarter earnings call. The company, which partnered with ChatGPT maker OpenAI in September, reported that traffic from AI tools to its online stores is up 7x since January of this year, and purchases attributed to AI-powered search have increased by 11x.\nAccording to Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, the company’s advantage in the AI era comes from its ability to access the data from millions of merchants and billions of transactions, and its “founder mode” mentality to ship products quickly.\nThis also includes its internal tools, like Scout, which uses AI to help Shopify employees search hundreds of millions of pieces of merchant feedback to make better product decisions.\n“And Scout is just one of many tools we’re developing to turn our own signals, whether it’s support tickets, usage data, reviews, social interactions, or even Sidekick prompts, into fast, informed decisions,” Finkelstein said on the call. “If you take away one thing from this call, let it be this: AI is not just a feature at Shopify. It is central to our engine that powers everything we build.”\nIn addition to ChatGPT, Shopify is working with Perplexity and Microsoft Copilot on other in-chat shopping experiences. A recent Shopify survey found that 64% of shoppers said they’re “likely” to use AI to some extent when making purchases.\n“We’ve been building and investing in this infrastructure to make it really easy to bring shopping into every single AI conversation,” Finkelstein said. “The fact that we’re already working with the leaders in the space should, I think, be a testament to the fact that we want to make sure merchants on Shopify are better prepared than those that are not. It’s still obviously very, very early,” he continued. “But what we’re really trying to do is lay the rails for agentic commerce.”\nWhile the company is currently focused on building connections with AI agents, it’s also prepared for the fact that there will be “different permutations” of how agentic commerce will evolve, Finkelstein also noted, which means it needs to be ready for “whichever path wins.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“That was the same thing when social commerce started to get a lot of attention, or when [people realized it wasn’t] e-commerce versus physical commerce but … this idea of commerce everywhere,” he added.\nSeparately, Shopify’s Q3 financial results showed revenue up 32% to $2.84 billion, ahead of estimates, and profit of $264 million, or 20 cents per share. However, the stock sagged on news that the company’s operating income of $434 million had missed estimates of $437 million.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Much of the location data is uploaded by ordinary apps installed on a person’s phone, which is sold to data brokers. Those data brokers then sell that data to governments and militaries. \nThe dataset also included the granular location histories of Europe’s top officials, including those who work directly for the European Commission, which has its headquarters in Brussels. \nThe reporters said they were able to identify hundreds of devices belonging to people who work in sensitive areas around the EU, including 2,000 location markers from 264 officials’ devices, and around 5,800 location markers from more than 750 devices in the European Parliament.\nEurope has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world with its GDPR law. However, watchdogs and officials across Europe have been slow to take stronger enforcement action against data brokers, Netzpolitik reported. Data brokering has ballooned to become a billion-dollar industry involving the sale and trade of people’s location data and other private information.\nTo counter some of this location tracking, Apple customers can anonymize their device identifiers, and Android owners can regularly reset their device’s identifier.\nLast year, a data broker called Gravy Analytics had a data breach that exposed the location data belonging to tens of millions of people, including where they have been and where they live and work. Researchers examining the data said the location records could be used to extensively track people’s recent whereabouts.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon has told Perplexity to get its agentic browser out of its online store, the companies both confirmed publicly on Tuesday. After warning Perplexity multiple times that Comet, its AI-powered shopping assistant, was violating Amazon’s terms of service by not identifying itself as an agent, the e-commerce giant sent the AI search engine startup a sternly worded cease-and-desist letter, Perplexity wrote in a blog post titled “Bullying is not innovation.”\n“This week, Perplexity received an aggressive legal threat from Amazon, demanding we prohibit Comet users from using their AI assistants on Amazon. This is Amazon’s first legal salvo against an AI company, and it is a threat to all internet users,” Perplexity lamented in the blog post.\nPerplexity’s argument is that, since its agent is acting on behalf of a human user’s direction, the agent automatically has the “same permissions” as the human user. The implication is that it doesn’t have to identify itself as an agent.\nAmazon’s response points out that other third-party agents working at the behest of human users do identify themselves. “It is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers,” Amazon’s statement explains.\nIf Amazon is to be believed, then Perplexity could simply identify its agent and start shopping. Of course, the risk is that Amazon, which has its own shopping bot called Rufus, could also block Comet — or any other third-party agentic shopper — from its site.\nAmazon suggests as much as its statement, which also says, “We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate.”\nPerplexity claims that Amazon would block the shopping bot because Amazon wants to sell advertising and product placements. Unlike human shoppers, a bot tasked with buying a new laundry basket presumably wouldn’t find itself buying a more expensive one, or getting lured into buying the latest Brandon Sanderson novel and a new set of earphones (on sale!).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf all of this sounds a bit familiar, that’s because it is. A few months ago, Cloudflare published research accusing Perplexity of scraping websites while specifically defying requests from websites blocking AI bots. Interestingly, many people came to Perplexity’s defense that time, because this wasn’t a clear-cut case of web crawler bad behavior. Cloudflare documented how the AI was accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. Perplexity fans argued that this is exactly what every human-operated web browser does.\nOn the other hand, Perplexity was using some questionable methods to do that accessing when a website opted out of bots, like hiding its identity.\nAs TechCrunch reported at the time, the Cloudflare incident foreshadowed the challenges to come if the agentic world materializes as Silicon Valley predicts it will. If consumers and companies outsource their shopping, travel bookings, and restaurant reservations to bots, will it be in the best interest of websites to block bots entirely? How will they allow and work with them?\nPerplexity may be right in that Amazon is setting a precedent. As the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce, it is clearly saying that the way this should work is for an agent to identify itself and let the website decide.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

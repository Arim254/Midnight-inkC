    "body": "\nNearly seven years after announcing its first fund, Sapphire Sport — the venture fund focused on sports, media, and entertainment — is spinning out from Sapphire Ventures. The fund will rebrand as an independent venture firm, 359 Capital.\nThe firm’s new name is a tribute to the sub-four-minute mile, a feat once deemed humanly impossible but ultimately achieved through rigorous dedication and perseverance. 359 Capital co-founder and managing partner Michael Spirito said that the name reflects the firm’s core principle of helping its portfolio founders achieve the impossible.\nThe separation from Sapphire Ventures, an investment firm with about $11 billion in assets under management, was always on “the vision board,” said Spirito. “We’re all grown up and ready to leave home.”\nSapphire Sport, which is currently halfway through investing its second fund of $181 million, has always maintained a separate group of limited partners from Sapphire Ventures. Its LPs are all deeply tied to the sports industry, including major names like City Football Group, adidas, AEG, Madison Square Garden, Sinclair, and dozens of team owners.\n“When we started in 2019, the name Sapphire Sport wasn’t just alliterative and sounded cool,” Spirito said. “Sport captured the LP group.”\nSeven years later, the sports-focused LPs still leverage their relationship with the firm to gain insights into emerging tech companies across the media and sports landscape, Spirito said.\nSome of the startups 359 Capital has backed include Beehiiv, a creator-focused newsletter; an online casino, Betty Labs; a sports media platform; Overtime, an AI search engine; Perplexity, a successful AI browser; and Tonal, a home gym system.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s entire portfolio of 30 companies and all of its investment staff will move over to 359 Capital. The transitioning staff includes Spirito, co-founders of Sapphire Ventures David Hartwig and Doug Higgins, and newly promoted partner Rico Mallozzi.\nAs 359 Capital, the firm will continue to focus primarily on Series A and Series B startups, writing checks between $2 million to $10 million. The firm will continue to invest from its second fund through the first half of 2027, Spirito said.\n359 Capital will have high-profile competition in the world of sports-focused venture capital. Courtside Ventures, backed by Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jordan, is in the process of raising a fourth fund of $100 million, according to an SEC filing.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCarbon management startup Carbon Direct is buying another carbon credit startup, Pachama, the companies announced today.\nPachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams.\n“The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.”\nPachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nPachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them.\nThe carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises. \nFor example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier’s credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place.\nAnd while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

In addition, the product’s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization’s nonprofit mission.\nWhile the post doesn’t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to “evade detection.” Meanwhile, it said that “human page views” had declined 8% year-over-year.\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n“For people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,” the post reads. “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.”\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The feature allows fans to chat, post, and listen to songs shared within these groups.\nThe feature is currently being tested in Canada on iOS and Android devices.\nUsers can access Fan Groups through the “Find” tab located beneath the search bar at the top of the app. From there, they can explore over 30 different groups dedicated to various musical interests, ranging from indie rock and country to Punjabi and K-pop, according to a company blog post.\nGroup members can create new posts, participate in ongoing chat threads, and share or save recommended songs. Users can also stream music without leaving the conversation or the group — they can simply tap the play button at the top to listen to all the songs added, or navigate to the separate “Music” tab next to “Posts.”\nNotably, artists can join these groups, giving them a new way to connect with fans directly. They can share exclusive content, interact more personally, and build stronger communities with their supporters.\nImage Credits:Amazon Music\nAnyone can set up a new group, and administrators can mute members and delete messages, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nVenmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo’s products. \nWhile cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo’s rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo’s Mastercard Debit Card.\nThe program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo’s service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains. \nHowever, this program also represents a new way that today’s brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.\nOne 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods.\nAs a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.\nIn Venmo’s case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes. \nIt also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo’s rivals, like Cash App’s offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit card customers.\nScreenshotImage Credits:Venmo\nInitially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month. \nHowever, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo’s program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald’s, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino’s, and Walgreens. \nThe PayPal-owned company says that next year Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAfter helping thousands of enterprises document how work actually happens, Scribe has raised $75 million at a $1.3 billion post-money valuation to roll out Scribe Optimize, a platform that maps workflows across the enterprise to reveal where automation and AI will actually yield returns — instead of becoming another sunk cost.\nThe all-equity Series C round was led by StepStone, with participation from existing investors Amplify Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Tiger Global, Morado Ventures, and New York Life Ventures. The new funding comes over a year after Scribe raised its $25 million Series B, capital the five-year-old startup has largely not needed to draw down, co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith (pictured above, left) said in an exclusive interview. With this round, Scribe plans to accelerate the rollout of Scribe Optimize and related products, as enterprises struggle to determine where AI and automation will have the greatest impact.\nMany companies are racing to adopt AI, but Smith told TechCrunch that most still cannot answer a fundamental question: What should we automate first? Enterprises often try to find the answer through interviews, workshops, or by bringing in consultants, she said, approaches that take months and still miss much of what people actually do on a day-to-day basis.\n“Without really knowing how work is done, it is really hard to know where to improve it, where to automate it, where agents can help,” she said. “Scribe Optimize is all about answering that question. Very simply, it mines across workflows for what people are doing when they’re at work, and then it abstracts those up into being able to show you in a single pane of glass, here are the actual workflows that are being done. Here’s how often, how long it takes, etc.”\nFounded in 2019 by Smith and CTO Aaron Podolny (pictured above, right), Scribe started before the GenAI boom, and its current flagship product, Scribe Capture, helps automatically document how work is done. When someone completes a process or workflow, Capture generates a step-by-step guide using its browser extension and desktop app, along with text and screenshots. Those guides can be shared with colleagues or embedded in internal tools to reduce repeated questions, minimize errors, and expedite onboarding.\nCustomers using Scribe Capture report saving 35 to 42 hours per person per month and making new hires 40% faster, the startup said.\nThe market of process documentation includes players including Tango, Iorad, UserGuiding, and Spekit. Nonetheless, Smith told TechCrunch that Scribe competes against the status quo of people manually recording workflows.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“People are still using stopwatches to sit behind somebody and understand what this process is,” she said. “Even now, when it comes to deploying AI agents, the irony is that the process of deploying agents is incredibly manual.”\nTo date, Scribe has documented more than 10 million workflows across 40,000 software applications. The startup said that it has more than 5 million users and is used by teams inside 94% of Fortune 500 companies. Further, 78,000 organizations are its paid customers. It counts teams at New York Life, T-Mobile, LinkedIn, HubSpot, and Northern Trust among its users.\n“Users come to Scribe not because their boss tells them to, but because they want to,” Smith told TechCrunch. “It starts with the end user, and then goes up to their team lead, department lead, and then some kind of central function who are all interested in it for the question of, how do we scale, what we know, how to do, and how do we get better?”\nThe San Francisco-based startup sees the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Europe among its biggest markets after the U.S.\nScribe said it has more than doubled its revenue over the past year, though it did not disclose figures, and also said its valuation has increased fivefold since its last round. The startup currently has a headcount of 120 employees, and it plans to double that number in the next 12 months, Smith said.\n"

    "body": "\nPeople often think about tech bubbles in apocalyptic terms, but it doesn’t have to be as serious as all that. In economic terms, a bubble is a bet that turned out to be too big, leaving you with more supply than demand.  \nThe upshot: It’s not all or nothing, and even good bets can turn sour if you aren’t careful about how you make them. \nWhat makes the question of the AI bubble so tricky to answer is mismatched timelines between the breakneck pace of AI software development and the slow crawl of constructing and powering a data center. \nBecause these data centers take years to build, a lot will inevitably change between now and when they come online. The supply chain that powers AI services is so complex and fluid that it’s hard to have any clarity on how much supply we’ll need a few years from now. It isn’t simply a matter of how much people will be using AI in 2028, but how they’ll be using it, and whether we’ll have any breakthroughs in energy, semiconductor design, or power transmission in the meantime. \nWhen a bet is this big, there are lots of ways it can go wrong — and AI bets are getting very big indeed.  \nLast week, Reuters reported that an Oracle-linked data center campus in New Mexico has drawn as much as $18 billion in credit from a consortium of 20 banks. Oracle has already contracted $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, and the companies have joined with SoftBank to build $500 billion in total AI infrastructure as part of the “Stargate” project. Meta, not to be outdone, has pledged to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. We’ve been tracking all the major commitments here — and the sheer volume has made it hard to keep up. \nAt the same time, there is real uncertainty about how fast demand for AI services will grow.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA McKinsey survey released last week looked at how top firms are employing AI tools. The results were mixed. Almost all the businesses contacted are using AI in some way, yet few are using it on any real scale. AI has allowed companies to cost-cut in specific use cases, but it’s not making a dent on the overall business. In short, most companies are still in “wait and see” mode. If you’re counting on those companies to buy space in your data center, you may be waiting a long time. \nBut even if AI demand is endless, these projects could run into more straightforward infrastructure problems. Last week, Satya Nadella surprised podcast listeners by saying he was more concerned with running out of data center space than running out of chips. (As he put it, “It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.”) At the same time, whole data centers are sitting idle because they can’t handle the power demands of the latest generation of chips.  \nWhile Nvidia and OpenAI have been moving forward as fast as they possibly can, the electrical grid and built environment are still moving at the same pace they always have. That leaves lots of opportunity for expensive bottlenecks, even if everything else goes right. \nWe get deeper into the idea in this week’s Equity podcast, which you can listen to below. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nKaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker’s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a “very leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he’s an expert [in this field], and that’s what we bought,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n“This acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation — not just video-on-demand lip-syncing — and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,” Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Beyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that’s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly — hyper-personalized and contextual — giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n“We started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf’s technology, we’re adding human-like capabilities — faces, eyes, mouths, ears — to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a “face,” it delivers the full workflow — avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn’t just streaming video; it’s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential “acquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.” But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura’s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to its current strategy.\nThis marks Kaltura’s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf’s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024. \nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.\n"

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more. \nFor example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations. \nOr, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nGoogle says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.\nFor example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says. \nTo access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button. \nGoogle says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move comes as Google announced back in September that it was introducing Gemini for Google TV to select TCL devices. The company said at the time that later in the year, Gemini would be arriving on the 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models. \nIn addition to the Google TV Streamer, Gemini is also available on the Walmart Onn 4K Pro streaming device.\nMonday’s announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. Plus, the company had announced at CES in January that Gemini would be coming to Google TV this year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy, and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow, she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is adding new AI features, including a builder agent and an MCP server — a tool that connects AI assistants to Google Maps’ technical documentation — to help developers and users create interactive projects using Maps data and code. The company said it is using Gemini models across the board to power these features.\nAmong these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. For instance, you can type “create a Street View tour of a city,” “create a map visualizing real-time weather in my region,” or “list pet-friendly hotels in the city.”\nOnce the code is generated, you can export it, test the preview project using your own API keys as needed, or modify the project in Firebase Studio.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe same tool also has a styling agent that lets users create a customized map to match a particular style format or theme. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding.\nGoogle already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources.\nWith this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. The feature can show a list, a map view, or a 3D display as an answer.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding a code assistant toolkit, the MCP server, which connects with Google Maps’ documentation. Developers can use this connection to get answers about how to use the Google Maps API and data. Last month, the company launched extensions for Gemini’s command line tool to let developers access Maps data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nThe company is also trying to add more Gemini-powered features for Maps on the consumer side.

    "body": "\nAlthough LLM-powered AI agents are a fairly new phenomenon, one of the areas where they’ve been most popular so far is in sales. 1mind, a startup co-founded by Amanda Kahlow, has been quietly shipping its sales agent, named Mindy, for about a year.  \nOn Monday, the startup announced a $30 million Series A round led by Battery Ventures. This brings 1mind’s total raise to $40 million, the company says. \nKahlow is well known in the sales and marketing tech world as the founder and former CEO of 6sense. It was launched in 2013 as a lead-generation tool that tracked signals across social media and other sites to identify potential customers. She left in 2020.\nWhile the sales agent market is already crowded, 1mind, and its agent, named Mindy, aren’ doing what most of them do: sending emails and making cold calls. That’s a crowded market where even her previous firm, 6sense, offers agents.\n“I’m not playing in outbound,” Kahlow tells TechCrunch. Mindy is intended to handle inbound sales, going all the way to “closing the deal,” Kahlow says. This agent is used to augment self-service websites and, Kahlow says, to replace the sales engineer on calls for larger enterprise deals. It can also be the onboarding specialist, setting up new customers. \n“Our goal is to truly replicate the human experience across go-to-market when you have intent, when buyers are leaning in: they come to your website, or they’re in a zoom call. She can ride along and be the sales engineer,” Kahlow adds, referring to Mindy with the anthropomorphic pronoun. \nKahlow even goes so far as to call her AI agents “superhumans,” though they are neither human nor do they possess comic-book-style superhuman powers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEach agent can, however, be trained to understand an expansive knowledge base that encompasses all of a company’s products, technical details, and competitive positions. \nWhile the startup uses a mix of underlying large-language models, including OpenAI and Google Gemini, the agent limits hallucinations by using deterministic AI, both Kahlow and Mindy said (I invited the agent to our call). Deterministic AI provides guardrails so once the agent ingests corporate sales materials, it should recite that info without deviation. Beyond that, Mindy is trained to say she doesn’t know an answer.\nWith a year of operations under its belt, 1mind is being used by more than 30 companies, including HubSpot, LinkedIn, and New Relic, to pitch and close deals. Kahlow says that her company’s entire roster of named customers all have annual contracts, not “experimental” budgets, and the “average contract is six figures.” \n1Mind AI agent MindyImage Credits:1mind\nThe company also uses the bot internally on its own sales calls. But Kahlow has gone even further. She created an avatar of herself, Amanda, and took it with her to her VC pitches. \nDuring Battery Ventures’ due diligence, “we used it to go through the data room, asking lots of questions on things like case studies,” Battery partner Neeraj Agrawal told TechCrunch about the avatar Amanda. The data room refers to the stacks of data a startup will share about itself with a VC. \n“The conversation design is very nuanced, like what case studies it shares and when,” he said. The VC also determined that customers were having long back-and-forth conversations, indicating that they would forget they were talking to an AI.\nThat avatar is still accessible via Kahlow’s LinkedIn page, where the public can interact with it. It can answer questions about 1mind’s products, but also other areas, like Kahlow’s views of being a woman in tech. However, having chatted with it, it will — much like the human Kahlow — always attempt to bend the conversation toward 1mind. \nEventually, Kahlow says, 1mind and other agentic sales startups will even replace higher-end account executive sales roles. Or at least drastically reimagine them. \n“We’re not there yet where we’re fully replacing the AE. We’re replacing the website. We’re replacing the sales engineer, customer success, but that [AE/customer] relationship there is still happening,” she says. “I think over time, a lot of what the AE is doing right now will go away.” \nShe believes this is currently mostly a trust issue. Agentic tech is so new that a buyer looking to sign an enormous enterprise deal isn’t ready to do it without a human. \nInterestingly, once trust develops, she thinks (and is already building for) agent-to-agent transactions won’t involve human avatars but will instead be transfers of information and requirements.\nIn the meantime, 1mind still employs humans: 44 of them, including in sales, with 71 job openings, including for account execs.\nThe round included participation from Primary Ventures, Wing Venture Capital, Operator Collective, Harmonic Growth Partners, and Success Venture Partners, as well as angels from Monday.com, ZoomInfo, Databricks, Box, Gong, Braze, and Verkada, 1mind said. \n"

    "body": "\nAutonomous vehicles are having a moment, and it’s making it a lot easier for smaller companies to raise money. Vay, a German startup offering remote-controlled rental cars, will get $60 million in cash from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab, the company announced on Monday.\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year,” Vay CEO Thomas von der Ohe wrote on LinkedIn.\nThe Berlin-based startup uses its technology and human operators to remotely drive rental cars to and from customers. Vay isn’t yet commercially deployed in real traffic in Germany, where it lacked regulatory clarity until recently, but the company is currently operational in Las Vegas, where it started in January 2024. Vay now plans to use Grab’s investments to scale and expand its operations in the U.S.\nVay will need to hit certain milestones in the U.S. to unlock additional investment from Grab, including number of U.S. cities covered, regulatory approvals obtained, and overall consumer revenue.\nThe U.S. is seeing increased competition and fast-expanding offerings of various forms of remote driving. For instance, Alphabet-owned Waymo recently announced it would deploy its robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego. \nAlthough publicly traded on the Nasdaq, Grab does not operate in the U.S., where it will limit itself to supporting Vay’s growth. \nHowever, Vay describes driverless car rental as complementary to robotaxis. As for Grab, it sees Vay as serving “a growing segment of consumers who prefer not to be car owners,” Grab co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said in a press release.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVay’s customers may not be car owners, but they still need a driving license: Once the car gets delivered, the user takes over and drives it like a regular car. But unlike their own car, they don’t need to find where to park it. Vay says its service costs about half the price of ride-hailing, thanks to this hybrid approach and hardware-light system.\nAt the same time, the two companies plan to explore synergies between Vay’s and Grab’s business in Southeast Asia. Calling itself “the everyday everything app,” Grab’s ubiquitous super-app offers ​​all-in-one taxi, ride hailing, transport, express grocery shopping, and food delivery options, as well as digital payments and financial services.\nWith a growing interest in mobility, Grab recently invested in autonomous driving tech startups, including May Mobility out of the U.S. and WeRide out of China. The synergies it finds with Vay may well be on the tech side — for instance, it said that driving data collected by Vay could accelerate the training of AI models to improve autonomous driving.\nThis also aligns with Vay’s vision to become more than an electric rental car fleet. The company has already expanded into commercial and business-to-business services, and closed a partnership with self-driving truck company Kodiak Robotics. Ultimately, it aims to build a “global remote driving platform,” von der Ohe told TechCrunch earlier this year.\nAccording to Crunchbase, Vay had raised $131.8 million from backers including Kinnevik, Coatue, Eurazeo, Atomico, General Catalyst, Creandum, and the European Investment Bank. If fully unlocked, Grab’s investment would be a significant boost. But with Nvidia announcing plans to invest $500 million into British self-driving tech startup Wayve, the race is only starting.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

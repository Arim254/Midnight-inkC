The move comes shortly after the company’s acquisition by the Italian tech conglomerate Bending Spoons, which purchased it in an all-cash deal last year for $1.38 billion.\nBending Spoons confirmed the layoffs to BI but wouldn’t share how many people would lose their jobs. The Verge reports that the cutbacks will impact a “large portion” of the company’s total workforce, citing a LinkedIn post from Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative, who stated that he, “along with a large portion of the company,” had been “impacted by layoffs.”\nTechCrunch reached out to Vimeo and Bending Spoons for more information.\nVimeo, which was founded in 2004, has struggled to find its footing in a field dominated by YouTube. In recent years, the company has leaned heavily into AI. In 2023, it announced plans to launch AI-powered script-writing and video-editing tools. This past October, the company added a suite of additional AI-powered creator tools designed to connect filmmakers’ “content directly to AI workflows.”\nIn recent years, Bending Spoons has acquired a number of other well-known tech platforms, including Meetup, Evernote, and WeTransfer.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

    "body": "\nA failed December effort to bring down parts of Poland’s energy grid was the work of Russian government hackers known for causing past energy disruptions, according to a security research firm that investigated the incident. \nLast week, Polish Energy Minister Milosz Motyka told reporters that the attempted cyberattack on December 29 and 30 saw hackers targeting two heat and power plants, as well as trying to disrupt the communication links between renewable installations, such as wind turbines and power distribution operators.\nMotyka called the incident the “strongest attack” on Poland’s energy infrastructure in years, with the Polish government blaming Moscow for the attempt. Local media reported that the attacks could have knocked out heat and power for at least half a million homes across the country. \nOn Friday, cybersecurity firm ESET said it obtained a copy of the destructive malware, which it calls DynoWiper. This type of malware, known as “wiper” malware, is designed to irreversibly destroy data on computers to prevent them from working. \nESET attributed the malware with “medium confidence” to the hacking group known as Sandworm, a unit within Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU, based on a “strong overlap” with its previous research into Sandworm’s past malware, including the group’s use of destructive malware to target Ukraine’s energy sector.\nIndependent journalist Kim Zetter first reported the news.\nAs noted by Zetter, the cyberattacks targeting Poland come almost exactly a decade after Sandworm’s first-known cyberattack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2015, which caused power outages for more than 230,000 homes around Kyiv, the country’s capital. A similar cyberattack hit Ukraine’s energy systems a year later. \nFollowing the attempted hack, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said that the country’s cybersecurity defenses worked, and “at no point was critical infrastructure threatened.”\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.\nThe NTSB is specifically focusing on the more than 20 incidents that have occurred in Austin, Texas, it said in a post on X on Friday.\n“Investigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,” the NTSB said in a statement to TechCrunch. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.\nIt’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation opened a similar probe in October.\nWaymo also issued a software recall last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.\nThe new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.\nThe first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.\nWaymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.\nBut as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on multiple occasions. \n“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sean by emailing sean.okane@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at okane.01 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nMeta today said that it is pausing teens’ access to its AI characters globally across all its apps. The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.\nThe move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media’s impact on teen mental health.\nIn October, the company previewed parental controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.\nMeta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.\nThe company has been cracking down on teens’ access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out parental control features on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.\nMeta’s previously previewed controls around AI characters.Image Credits:Meta\n“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post. \nMeta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.\nSocial media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.\nBesides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and started predicting a user’s age to apply content restrictions.\nCorrection: This post was updated to clarify the new version of AI characters will be accessible to everyone, not just teens, when it launches. It will include parental controls. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle Photos will now let you make memes with your own images. On Thursday, Google introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.\nThe new feature, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally spotted in development last October by the blog Android Authority. It was formally announced by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.\nThe addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model powers other AI features in the Google Photos app, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings. \nThough a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.\nPlus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as OpenAI found with its successful launch of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends. \n“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says. A rep for Google told TechCrunch the feature will reach U.S. iOS and Android users over the “coming weeks.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google notes that more templates are being added over time. After the AI creates the image, you can save the photo, share it on other platforms, or tap “regenerate” to have it re-imagine the image a second time.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into HR and payroll startup Deel over allegations that it hired a corporate spy to leak information on its biggest rival, Rippling, reports The Wall Street Journal.\nIn an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Deel says that it is “not aware of any investigation. We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”\nDeel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.\nThis is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.\nTo recap, Rippling sued Deel in May, and revised the suit in June, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie. The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.\nRippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.\nDeel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe spy lived in fear\nThe man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”\nBut the man also went back to court alleging that his family was living in terror because he believed men from Deel were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance.\nPayment to the spy \nRippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, when it obtained bank records. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.\nIn the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.\nRippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.\nSo it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.\nNone of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit a $17.3 billion valuation after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a $16.8 billion valuation in May after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.\n"

    "body": "\nDefense tech company Anduril on Thursday announced its plans to expand its Southern California presence with a major campus in Long Beach, the coastal town where founder Palmer Luckey grew up.\nThe expanded campus will eventually support about 5,500 jobs. Luckey told TechCrunch that these will be new jobs, not transfers from other operations.\nAnduril’s headquarters is nearby, in Costa Mesa, California, and it also has a massive manufacturing facility in Ohio. The Long Beach campus will span 1.18 million square feet across six buildings, combining office space and industrial areas dedicated to R&D. It is expected to be ready by mid-2027, the company said.\nLong Beach is “a major aerospace hub right in our backyard,” Luckey told TechCrunch about why the company chose that location.\nThe plan is to hire similar types of employees to those working at headquarters: manufacturing workers, technicians, assembly workers, and engineers across disciplines (electrical, mechanical, aerodynamics), as well as build and test roles, and “a lot of people on the logistics side, because the things that we’re going to be making there, we’re going to be sending all over the world,” he said.\nWhile bringing thousands of jobs to his childhood town made headlines today, Luckey said the most exciting part for him about Anduril’s general expansion was the fighter jets.\n“It looks like we’re going to be able to manufacture autonomous fighter jets that will take off right from the factory and fly to wherever the customer needs them,” he said. “We might have jets leaving the factory, flying directly into combat. And I think that that is extremely cool.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe plan is currently not to directly manufacturer fighter jets at the Long Beach facility — it will be focused on manufacturing-adjacent work like R&D, a company spokesperson tells TechCrunch. Manufacturing will be done at the company’s large Ohio facility.\nAnduril makes autonomous military drones and aircraft for land, air, and sea. In 2025, it unveiled a fighter jet called Fury, designed to fly autonomously, meaning it operates using AI rather than being piloted remotely by a human operator. The AI executes flight plans set by humans. The Fury completed its first test flight in California on October 31. \nNote: This story has been updated to include the company’s clarification on where Anduril’s fighter jets will be manufactured.\n"

This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off. \nBut, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.\nThe case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year. \nApart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.\n“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nKais Khimji has spent most of his professional career as a venture investor, including six years as a partner at the prominent VC firm Sequoia Capital.\nBut just like several other former Sequoia partners — including David Vélez, who founded the Brazilian digital bank Nubank — Khimji (pictured right) has always wanted to be a startup founder. On Thursday, he announced that he has revived an idea he began working on as a student at Harvard about 10 years ago, turning it into the AI calendar-scheduling company Blockit. In a major vote of confidence, Khimji’s former employer, Sequoia, led the company’s $5 million seed round.\n“Blockit has a chance to become a $1Bn+ revenue business, and Kais will make sure it gets there,” Pat Grady, Sequoia’s general partner and co-steward who led the investment, wrote in a blog post.\nWhile many startups have tried to automate scheduling in the past, Khimji believes that thanks to advances in LLMs, Blockit’s AI agents can handle scheduling more seamlessly and efficiently than many of its predecessors, including now-defunct startups Clara Labs and x.ai. (Yes, that domain name ended up with Elon Musk’s AI company.)\nUnlike the current category leader Calendly, which was last valued at $3 billion and relies on users sharing links to find availability, Blockit is betting that its AI agents can master the nuance required to handle the entire scheduling process without human involvement.\nWith Blockit, Khimji and co-founder John Han — who previously worked on calendar products, including Timeful, Google Calendar, and Clockwise — are building what is essentially an AI social network for people’s time.\n“It always felt very odd. I have a time database — my calendar. You have a time database — your calendar, and our databases just can’t talk to each other,” Khimji told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKhimji says that Blockit can finally solve this disconnection. When two users need to meet, their respective AI agents communicate directly to negotiate a time, bypassing the typical back-and-forth emails entirely.\nUsers can invoke the Blockit agent by copying it on an email or messaging it in Slack about a meeting. The bot then takes over the logistics, negotiating a mutually convenient time and location that fits the preferences of all participants.\nKhimji said that Blockit can work as seamlessly as a human executive assistant. Users simply need to provide the system with specific instructions about their preferences, such as which meetings are nonnegotiable and which are “movable” based on daily needs. “Sometimes my calendar is crazy, so I need to skip lunch, and the agent needs to know that it’s okay to skip lunch,” he said.\nThe system can even be trained to prioritize meetings based on the tone of an email. For instance, a user might instruct the agent that a meeting request signed with a formal “Best regards” should take precedence over a casual interaction ending with “Cheers.”\nBy learning the preferences of its users, Blockit appears to be capitalizing on what venture firm Foundation Capital’s partners Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg call “context graphs.” In a widely shared essay, the investors describe a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AI agents to capture the “why” behind every business decision by relying on the hidden logic that previously only existed in a person’s head.\nBlockit is already being used by more than 200 companies, including AI startup Together.ai, the newly acquired fintech company Brex, and robotics startup Rogo, as well as venture firms a16z, Accel, and Index. The app is available for free for 30 days. After that, it costs $1,000 annually for individual users and $5,000 annually for a team license with support for multiple users, Khimji said.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\nThe decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves. \nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states. \nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. Tesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has reorganized some of its leadership and picked a familiar face to lead its push into selling AI to business customers as the company looks to catch up to its rivals in 2026.\nThe company appointed Barret Zoph to lead its efforts to sell its AI to enterprises, according to reporting from The Information, citing an internal OpenAI memo.\nTechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and more information.\nZoph returned to OpenAI last week after leaving Thinking Machine Labs, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s AI startup where Zoph had served as a co-founder and CTO since October 2024.\nThe exact circumstances of his departure aren’t clear, with rumors swirling about whether Zoph and a few other former OpenAI employees were fired or left on their own accord, possibly with plans to return to OpenAI all along.\nZoph was previously the vice president of post-training inference at OpenAI from September 2022 to October 2024. He’s stepping into a very different position and will likely play an important role at the company as it looks to grow its enterprise business — an area where it is losing ground to competitors.\nOpenAI launched its enterprise-focused ChatGPT Enterprise product in 2023 more than a year before Anthropic and multiple years before Google launched its enterprise offerings. The company claims the product has more than 5 million business users and counts companies including SoftBank, Target, and Lowe’s as customers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut its market share is falling while its rivals are climbing.\nAnthropic holds a dominant lead over its AI rivals when it comes to enterprise large language model usage. The AI research lab holds a 40% market share, according to a December report from VC firm Menlo Ventures (which, it should be noted, has invested aggressively in Anthropic). In July, the startup’s market share was estimated to be 32%.\nGoogle’s Gemini adoption has been steadier, according to Menlo Ventures. The company released its enterprise product last fall and has seen its enterprise LLM usage market share largely stay the same, per Menlo’s findings, growing from 20% in July to 21% at the end of the year.\nOpenAI on the other hand has seen its usage market share drop from 50% in 2023 to 27% at the end of 2025 — a trend that appears to concern the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern specifically that Google Gemini’s growth was starting to encroach on OpenAI in an internal memo a few months ago.\nEnterprise growth is an area of focus for the company in 2026, OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar wrote in a blog post this past Sunday.\nThe company has since announced an expanded multi-year partnership with ServiceNow that will give ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI models.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nRyan Mitchell, the founder of a startup called Space Beyond, remembers looking at the night sky while camping at a state park and wondering what he should do next. \nA manufacturing engineer who worked on NASA’s space shuttle program before spending nearly a decade at Jeff Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, Mitchell was considering his options. In those jobs, he had seen the cost to access space come down dramatically, thanks in large part to Blue Origin’s rival SpaceX. Those stars in the sky, he thought, seemed closer than ever. \nMitchell told TechCrunch that an idea finally clicked when he was attending a family member’s ash-spreading ceremony. \n“When it was over, we were kind of like, ‘now what?’ The moment was gone,” he said. He remembered thinking: “How could I do this better?”\nThat, he said, was the beginning of building Space Beyond and its “Ashes to Space” program, which will use a CubeSat, a class of miniature cube-shaped satellites, to send as many as 1,000 people’s ashes to space in one go. On Thursday, Space Beyond announced it signed a launch services agreement with Arrow Science and Technology, which will integrate the CubeSat on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission scheduled for October 2027.\nSending people’s ashes to space is not a new idea. Companies like Celestis have been doing it since the 1990s. What Mitchell said is different about Space Beyond is that it’s doing it affordably — with its cheapest offering coming in at just $249. Other options typically cost in the thousands of dollars. (That said, customers will need to have the cremation performed elsewhere.) \nMitchell said Space Beyond has achieved this a few ways. Foremost is the rideshare model, which has greatly democratized access to space in general. Companies can now develop small CubeSats that get integrated into larger spacecraft for a fraction of the total price to hitch a ride on a Falcon 9, allowing for all sorts of new science and small-scale commercial missions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Space Beyond is also bootstrapped and not trying to generate big returns for investors.  \n“I’ve been told I’m not charging enough for this service,” he said, especially when considering how the funeral industry is built around over-charging people at one of their most vulnerable moments. “But I’m not looking to take over the world, and I’m not looking to make a billion dollars doing this.” \nThere are limits to what Space Beyond can offer, given the CubeSat format. For one, customers will only be able to send about one gram’s worth of ashes to space. This allows for the startup to fit enough customers’ ashes on board to make the idea financially viable. But it’s also a result of the fact that — despite the easier access to space — weight is still a huge consideration for launch providers like SpaceX.\nSpace Beyond’s CubeSat will also only be in orbit for about five years, so this is not a memorial that will last forever.\nBut Mitchell said there are benefits to this approach. The company’s CubeSat will be in what’s known as a “sun-synchronous orbit,” which is at a very high altitude of around 550 kilometers (or around 341 miles). This allows the satellite to fly over the entire globe. With many modern spacecraft tracking services available, customers should be able to locate the CubeSat and know when it is in the night sky above their home.\nA five-year limit also means that the aluminum CubeSat and the ashes onboard will ultimately meet a fiery end as it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere upon re-entry — a nice symbolic ending, Mitchell said, even if there’s no guarantee that customers will be able to see the resulting fireball.\nSpace Beyond will also never physically spread a customer’s ashes in space. That would be “almost a nightmare scenario,” Mitchell said, as the particles could create a debris cloud that could doom other spacecraft. But given that customers can only send around one gram per space, they’ll be able to do what they want with the rest of a loved one’s ashes. \nWhen Mitchell left Blue Origin last year, he said he filled “several pages” of a notebook with ideas of what to do next. The range was wide, including options like trying to be a launch director at another space company, or becoming a Kava bartender. Something kept pulling him back to this one, though.\n“I tried to talk myself out of [this idea] for a long time. I thought it would be too expensive or too difficult,” he explained. But he said it just made sense to him “every time I put actual engineering rigor to it, figured out what the requirements are, and what the business case is.” \nIt was also the idea that he was clearly most obsessed with. “My wife said: ‘I could have told you that weeks ago. You can’t stop talking about this,’” he said. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nEmily is a college student by day, but she works the night shift at the strip club to pay her tuition — she doesn’t think anyone will find out her secret, until one day, her mysterious English teacher shows up! Did he recognize her? Will her secret get out? Pay 60 “tokens” to see what happens next, or you can watch an ad, or… just buy a VIP pass for $20 per week and skip the ads altogether.\nThese stories are pulpy and exaggerated, bursting with cringeworthy acting and writing. Yet these “microdramas” — TikTok-like shows with episodes about a minute long — are making billions of dollars a year.\nFirst popular in China, microdrama apps are poised to have a breakout year in the U.S. app market. According to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, ReelShort reached roughly $1.2 billion in gross consumer spending in 2025, up 119% from 2024; another leading app, DramaBox, made $276 million in gross consumer spending last year, more than doubling its 2024 numbers.\nThe market doesn’t appear to be slowing down. TikTok just launched its own standalone microdrama app called PineDrama, and a new app from Hollywood veterans called GammaTime just raised $14 million, including checks from angel investors like Alexis Ohanian, Kris Jenner, and Kim Kardashian. \nImage Credits:Appfigures Intelligence\nIt’s surprising to see short-form, scripted drama apps achieve such success when we’re only five years removed from the implosion of Quibi. Quibi wanted to be like Netflix, but with 10-minute episodes that were designed to be watched on the go. Founded by Dreamworks co-founder and former Disney chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi raised more than $1.75 billion in funding from major Hollywood studios, then created shows with stars like Liam Hemsworth, Reese Witherspoon, and Anna Kendrick.\nNo one wanted Quibi, and the app turned into a punchline because of how massively it flopped. But ReelShort –- an app whose top shows are called “My Sister Is the Warlord Queen” and “In Love with a Single Farmer-Daddy” –- is a hit. \n“How are they succeeding where Quibi failed? They’re basically OnlyFans for the female gaze,” Eric Wei, creator economy expert and CEO of Karat Financial, told TechCrunch. “They do romantasy, where the titles are all like, ‘My Alpha.’ This is like ‘50 Shades of Grey,’ but for vertical video.”\nOnlyFans isn’t the best comparison (these shows can be suggestive, though not pornographic), but Wei is right that sex sells. When a story seems like it might be heating up, you’ll be prompted to watch ads or pay money to keep going. But the payoff is never that compelling, so you keep watching, only to see another pop-up asking for more money, or other ambiguous in-app currency.\nThe business model behind these apps replicates the same dark patterns as mobile games. They’re designed to get users hooked on free content, giving out free in-app currency for logging in each day. As people spend more time on the app — which is designed to be addictive — they need more coins or tokens to unlock more episodes of a show, but there’s no way to earn enough to get their fix without shelling out real money.\nSometimes a microdrama is interactive, allowing viewers to choose which route the story will take — but the good option (the woman stands up to her abusive ex) will cost tokens, while the less satisfying one (the abusive ex faces no consequences for his actions) is free.\nSoon, a hooked viewer may relent and pay for the weekly $20 ad-free pass, which, after a month, would cost more than subscriptions to HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Paramount Plus combined.\nAs AI enters the picture, these companies will churn out content at an even more alarming pace. LLMs are not capable of writing prestige dramas like HBO’s “Succession,” or even a sitcom like “The Big Bang Theory,” but the most successful microdramas are so predictable and formulaic that they don’t actually require much human wit and creativity. You’d be shocked to learn how many microdramas begin with a scene in which a girl with glasses gets pushed down by a mean classmate, only to be saved by some popular jock, who notices she’s actually really pretty if she just takes off her glasses.\nPocketFM, the Lightspeed-backed audio-series platform, has already embraced AI. Last year, it released a tool it calls CoPilot, which was trained on thousands of hours of content to understand the “beats” of a formulaic story, helping writers add cliffhangers or plot twists to their stories that it predicts will make audiences want to watch more. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian company Holywater, which raised $22 million to fund its microdrama app My Drama, calls itself an “AI-first entertainment network.”\nWhile microdrama could fully go the way of AI, Dhar Mann Studios CEO Sean Atkins thinks there’s also an opportunity for creators. \n“Think about it — short-form is a little less overhead than long-form, and vertical is even less overhead,” Atkins told TechCrunch. “I think you’ll see a handful of creators start going into that pretty significantly, particularly since they have the experience of low-cost production.”\nThese companies have a great business model on their hands. But it’s one that thrives on short attention spans, in-app purchases, and content that feels like “Cocomelon” for adults.\n"

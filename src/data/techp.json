But while app access to ChatGPT is tightly curated, Gemini CLI extensions can be published with no endorsement or participation from Google. Available extensions will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://geminicli.com/extensions/\">hosted in public repositories on Github</a> and installed manually by developers.</p>\n<p>“That open ecosystem is vital to us,” Taylor Mullen, a senior staff engineer on the project, told TechCrunch. “Everything we’re doing is grounded in a fair ecosystem that anyone can participate in.”</p>\n<p>The first available extension was to Google’s own Nanobanana image generator, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana\">posted to GitHub</a> last week. Once installed, the extension allows users to generate images directly from the Gemini CLI terminal.</p>\n<p>Launched in June, Gemini CLI has grown to over one million users, Google says, with usage heavily skewed towards software developers. Notably, Gemini CLI is heavily used in the development and maintenance of its own codebase, closely overseen by product managers, as detailed in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\">a recent TechCrunch interview</a>.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Google’s senior director of product management for developer tools Ryan J. Salva told TechCrunch that the purpose of the new feature was to turn Gemini CLI into “an extensibility platform, a conduit to other tools and instructions that come from elsewhere in your tool chain.”</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a senior product manager at Google Labs, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”</p>\n<p>Opal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal. </p>\n<p>The tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork. </p>\n<p>Google also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.</p>\n<p>With the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is bringing its AI-powered conversational search feature, Search Live, to India — launching in English and Hindi — and expanding AI Mode to seven new Indian languages, as the company strengthens its presence in one of its fastest-growing markets.</p>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/googles-ai-mode-gets-new-canvas-feature-real-time-help-with-search-live-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> in the U.S. in July, Search Live builds on Google’s Project Astra technology and is available through the company’s AI Mode. The feature lets users point their phone camera at objects to get real-time assistance, supporting back-and-forth conversations that draw on the visual context from the camera feed.</p>\n<p>With this launch, India becomes the second market after the U.S. to get Search Live — a logical move given the country’s vast base of early AI adopters, who have helped Google grow products like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/india-leads-the-way-on-googles-nano-banana-with-a-local-creative-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini’s Nano Banana model</a>. Google plans to leverage India’s early adoption to train its systems on a wider range of visual contexts, making Search Live more capable over time.</p>\n<p>“People in India are power users of multimodal search, forming our largest user base for both voice and visual search globally,” said Hema Budaraja, vice president of product management for Search at Google, in a new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/supercharging-search-for-india-new-languages-in-ai-mode-search-live-debuts/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Search Live is starting to roll out to users in India today and will reach more people over the coming weeks. Once available, users can access it by tapping the “Live” icon under the search bar in the Google app, or by opening Lens and selecting “Live” from the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Google revealed that Search Live is <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/search-live-ai-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">powered by a custom version of Gemini</a>. The Gemini app separately includes a similarly named feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-updates-the-gemini-app-with-real-time-ai-video-deep-research-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">called Gemini Live</a>, which was introduced in May and offers a comparable experience. This overlap could easily confuse some users.</p>\n<p>Google has also expanded its AI Mode to seven Indian languages: Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. This is part of a global AI Mode expansion, which will be available in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-languages-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 35 new languages and 40 new countries and territories</a>, making the AI-powered search experience accessible in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Google’s AI Mode, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/google-searchs-new-ai-mode-lets-users-ask-complex-multi-part-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted</a> in the U.S. in March and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">rolled out to more U.S. users</a> in May, lets users ask complex, multi-part questions through an AI-powered interface.

Last month, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/googles-ai-mode-adds-5-new-languages-including-hindi-japanese-and-korean/\" target=\"_blank\">added five new languages</a> — including Hindi, Indonesian, and Japanese — to the feature.</p>\n<p>“The advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding of our custom Gemini model for Search allows AI Mode to truly grasp the subtleties of local languages, ensuring AI Mode is genuinely helpful and relevant in all the new languages we introduce,” Budaraju said in his post.</p>\n<p>Google’s AI Mode and other AI features, including AI Overviews, have faced criticism for reducing search traffic to online publishers. The company, however, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/google-denies-ai-search-features-are-killing-website-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\">denied that its AI-driven search tools are hurting</a> website visits.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

The regime’s total amount of stolen crypto since 2017 is at least $6 billion, according to Elliptic, which said that figure may still be an underestimate.  </p>\n<p>“The actual figure may be even higher. Attributing cyber thefts to North Korea is not an exact science,” reads the blog post.  </p>\n<p>“We are aware of many other thefts that share some of the hallmarks of North Korea-linked activity but lack sufficient evidence to be definitively attributed.

This shift highlights that the weak point in cryptocurrency security is increasingly human, rather than technical.” </p>\n<p>Elliptic’s estimate seems to be in line with that of other organizations.

It suggests making Packs an extension of the service’s existing account discoverability features. That means to opt out of Packs, you would disable the setting “Feature profile and posts in discoverability algorithms.”</p>\n<p>In addition, users will be notified when they’re included in a Pack. On Bluesky, a user who wanted to be removed from a Starter Pack would have to report the pack or block the user who made it. Mastodon says it aims to offer a simpler mechanism to remove themselves from Packs, similar to how it allows users to remove their posts from the newly launched Quote Posts. </p>\n<p>The nonprofit developing the Mastodon software, Mastodon gGmbH, is collaborating with other fediverse developers on a <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP)</a>, which is now on <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.

Liang wants Otter.ai to become a go-to source for enterprises and a new batch of products released Tuesday is the first step in that evolution. </p>\n<p>The Silicon Valley-based AI meeting assistant startup on Tuesday released a new suite of tools for enterprises designed to better incorporate data from meetings into other workflows by funneling that information to a central knowledge base. The aim is to grow Otter’s business by helping companies get more out of the meetings they record.</p>\n<p>Otter’s new product suite includes an API that allows users to build custom integrations with platforms like Jira and HubSpot, an MCP server — which connects users’ Otter data to external AI models — and a new AI agent that can search a company’s meetings notes or presentations.  </p>\n<p>Liang told TechCrunch it is the next phase of Otter’s life.  </p>\n<p>“We are evolving from a meeting notetaker to a corporate meeting knowledge base,” Liang said. “This is a system record for conversations. It can help corporations scale their growth and drive measurable business value.” </p>\n<p>When Otter was founded in 2016, there were just a handful of meeting transcription companies — a far leap from today. The AI boom that kicked off in 2022 fueled a surge in startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Granola</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/yc-backed-circleback-is-out-to-become-the-best-meeting-notetaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Circleback</a>. Even older players like Fireflies have seen a <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai/blog/fireflies-1-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">surge in interest</a>.  </p>\n<p>Liang argues this transition puts Otter into a separate division than its former peers.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meetings are where the majority of company knowledge is stored, in Liang’s opinion, whether that is notes from a customer sales call or discussions around a marketing strategy. But without a centralized place for these meeting notes, that information can only help a company so much.  </p>\n<p>“A lot of times, inefficiency happens because of information silos,” Liang said. “One team doesn’t know what the other team is doing, and it thinks that that was planned like a month ago. Oftentimes the plan changes, but not everybody is informed. So, the idea is to create a permission system so that you know most of the [nonconfidential] information is shared as broadly as possible.” </p>\n<p>Not every meeting with Otter will be directly added to this companywide knowledge base, and users can choose to restrict meeting note access for recordings that deal with sensitive information.  </p>\n<p>Employee and information privacy remains a concern despite access controls. Even if a meeting is around a neutral topic, Otter transcriptions pick the small talk and chatter that happens before and after meetings, which could contain gossip or information meant for only certain participants to hear.  </p>\n<p>Otter is also the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/g-s1-83087/otter-ai-transcription-class-action-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">August class-action lawsuit</a> that claims the company was recording private conversations without user consent and using that information to train its transcription services. </p>\n<p>Liang said that while he can’t comment on the lawsuit specifically, this isn’t an issue specific to Otter, and that when looking at the bigger picture, more access to information is better than not.  </p>\n<p>“If they accuse us, then they could accuse everyone else, all the tools you heard about doing meeting notes,” Liang said. “My view is that we are on the right side of history. We’re building this new AI revolution. If you want AI to help, you need to put AI in the meetings.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://qapita.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Qapita</a>, a Singapore-based equity management platform, has raised $26.5 million in a Series B round led by Charles Schwab.</p>\n<p>As part of the deal, Charles Schwab has introduced a new platform called Schwab Private Issuer Equity Services — powered by Qapita — which let’s U.S. startups manage their cap tables, administer stock plans, and prepare for public listings. </p>\n<p>Founded in 2019 by former banker Ravi Ravulaparthi (CEO) with Lakshman Gupta (COO) and Vamsee Mohan (CTO) (pictured above, from left to right), Qapita helps private companies track ownership, manage employee equity, and facilitate secondary share sales. The startup serves private companies across Southeast Asia and the U.S., and also provides its platform for listed firms in India to manage equity after going public.</p>\n<p>Qapita began as a platform to manage cap tables after Ravulaparthi, during his earlier banking career, noticed that many companies still relied on spreadsheets. When the startup launched in January 2021, it expanded the platform based on early customer feedback to include an equity management tool for employee stock plans, initially released in beta. Competitor Carta later entered the Indian market but exited in 2023, giving Qapita room to strengthen its position.</p>\n<p>The startup currently has about 2,700 companies using its platform, it says. Roughly 70% are based in India and 20% in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Indonesia. Qapita counts around half of India’s unicorns among its customers, Ravulaparthi said in an interview.</p>\n<p>While Qapita offers free access to its platform for early-stage companies, about half of its users — roughly 1,400 firms — pay for at least one of its services, Ravulaparthi told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to India and Southeast Asia, the startup has a few users in the U.S. as part of its early market testing.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy is looking to cut billions more in federal funding, and many promising startups as well as automakers Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis could be affected by the Trump administration’s decision.</p>\n<p>The proposed cuts would cancel more than $500 million of contracts awarded to more than a dozen startups, according to a TechCrunch analysis of an internal document that has not become public yet. All of the proposed cuts are grants that had been awarded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The proposed cancellations, many of which have not been reported before, come on top of more than $7.5 billion in contracts the Trump administration said it would cut <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/department-of-energy-cancels-7-5b-of-clean-energy-projects-in-mostly-blue-states/\">last week</a>.</p>\n<p>Startups might not be the only losers. Other companies slated to lose grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars include Daimler Trucks North America, Ford, General Motors, Harley-Davidson, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Stellantis, and Volvo Technology of America, according to the document viewed by TechCrunch. Sources confirmed with TechCrunch these are proposed cuts. </p>\n<p>General Motors could lose at least <a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-investments-gms-lansing-grand-river-assembly-underscore\" target=\"_blank\">$500 million in grant money</a> issued from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. The money was going to be used to retool the Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. The automaker announced in July 2024 it planned to produce electrified vehicles, including hybrids, at the plant.</p>\n<p>Some of the awards are significant and, if cut, will undoubtedly affect the startups’ operations. Several were included in a list of proposed cuts that leaked last week, but many are new and have yet to be announced. TechCrunch has reached out to several of the companies and will update this article if they reply.</p>\n<p>Two awards on the chopping block topped $100 million, including a $189 million award granted to materials startup Brimstone. Those funds would have helped the company build a plant to produce Portland cement, alumina, and other materials using less carbon dioxide. </p>\n<p>The other went to Anovion, a Chicago-based startup that is working to build a factory to produce a domestic supply of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries. Currently, Chinese companies dominate the graphite market.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Battery materials startup Li Industries received $55.2 million under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to recycle LFP batteries in an attempt to wrest part of that supply chain from China.</p>\n<p>Other cement startups are on the list, too. Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime Systems was given an award for $86.9 million to build an ultra-low-carbon cement plant. Mountain View-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/cement-startup-furno-lands-20m-grant-to-build-low-carbon-micro-kilns-in-chicago/\">Furno</a>, which is making a novel, modular cement kiln, would lose its $20 million grant to build a demonstration plant in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Several building materials companies were also on the list. CleanFiber and Hempitecture, which make insulation for homes and commercial buildings, are at risk of losing $10 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Skyven Technologies, which makes industrial heat pumps, and Luxwall, which makes super-insulated windows, would lose $15 million and $31 million, respectively. </p>\n<p>At least one of the proposed cancelations seemingly cuts against the administration’s goals of energy and AI dominance. TS Conductor, which could lose $28.2 million in grant money, makes advanced conductors for electric lines that promise to double or triple capacity on existing transmission lines.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After AMD and OpenAI announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded partnership on Monday</a>, the <a href=\"https://x.com/litcapital/status/1975402366611378538\" target=\"_blank\">chatter</a> immediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. </p>\n<p>To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. </p>\n<p>But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 apiece, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\">AMD disclosed</a>. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement.  </p>\n<p>If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about $100 billion.  </p>\n<p>“We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases.  </p>\n<p>Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and institutional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. </p>\n<p>In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investment <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">announced last month</a>. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. </p>\n<p>But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% market share, USB estimates — into one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">biggest build-outs</a> of next-generation data centers the world has ever seen.  </p>\n<p>While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.” </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>British fintech <a href=\"http://revolut.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Revolut</a> — now launching in India — says cross-border payments remain one of India’s most underserved financial services. By its estimate, Indians spend about $30 billion overseas every year and lose around $600 million in bank charges — fees its India head calls “criminal.”</p>\n<p>“It has been the preserve of banks,” Paroma Chatterjee, Revolut India CEO, told TechCrunch. “You go to your bank to take currency, foreign exchange out from your bank, or you take a travel card that is issued by your bank when you’re traveling overseas … there have been humongous charges which have been levied on this.”</p>\n<p>Since 2021, Revolut has been working toward its India launch, aiming to fill what it sees as gaps in the country’s foreign exchange and traditional payments spaces. The London-headquartered fintech <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/en-US/news/revolut_acquires_indian_forex_business_as_it_advances_multi_million_dollar_india_expansion_plan/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired Arvog Forex</a> in 2022 to obtain a license and offer remittance and multi-currency account services in India. In April this year, it also <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/en-IN/news/revolut_receives_full_authorisation_from_rbi_to_issue_domestic_prepaid_cards_and_wallets_in_india/\" target=\"_blank\">secured a prepaid payment instrument (PPI) license</a> from the Reserve Bank of India, allowing it to issue prepaid cards, support digital wallets and integrate with the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI).</p>\n<p>With these regulatory approvals, Revolut aims to challenge traditional banks in India and compete with existing fintech players. The British startup is targeting more than 150 million “globally aspiring, digitally native” Indians aged between 25 and 45, with plans to onboard about 20 million users by 2030 and process at least $7 billion worth of their transactions.</p>\n<p>Chatterjee said that such regulatory approvals — including the PPI license — allows the fintech to offer a more differentiated experience than players that rely on bank partnerships. “We can deliver the kind of customer experience that we want to deliver,” she said.</p>\n<p>Revolut will offer Indian consumers a prepaid wallet with UPI support and its own branded UPI handles, along with a domestic Visa card and an international multi-currency Visa card. It will also introduce dedicated kids and teens accounts linked to parents’ profiles, a subscription-based model, and budgeting and analytics tools that provide insights into spending habits.</p>\n<p>Notably, the startup has regulatory permissions to enable both domestic and international payments and transfers through its platform. It also has authorization to enable same-day remittances from India through a local bank partner.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Unlike many Indian fintech players that use minimum know-your-customer (KYC) checks to quickly onboard users for limited, low-value transactions, Revolut will offer only full-KYC wallets. The fintech will also verify new users against global sanctions lists, including those maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United Nations. This approach, Chatterjee said, is aimed at attracting “high-intent customers” who are willing to complete a more detailed onboarding process, including Aadhaar and video verification.</p>\n<p>“Somebody would do that only if they’re interested in using the product. So, this full KYC customer onboarded is going to be my customer metric,” she noted.</p>\n<p>“In a country like India, once you list yourself on the App Store, sheer curiosity drives downloads,” she said. “That’s not our metric of success.”</p>\n<p>The fintech also aims to measure its success in India by the depth of user engagement and profitability and not merely increasing its user base.</p>\n<p>“There are people who talk about having 300–400 million customers,” Chatterjee told TechCrunch. “Revolut globally in 39 countries has 65 million customers, and it is valued at $75 billion. The reason is that from these 65 million customers, Revolut is processing more than $4 billion worth of transactions and delivering more than a billion dollars worth of profit. And that is because out of those 65 million customers in any given month, more than 25 million customers are active.”</p>\n<p>She’s referring to the the new valuation Revolut <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/revolut-valuation-jumps-75bn-staff-set-for-payout-opportunity\">announced last month</a> on the back of a secondary share sale, that boosted it from $45 billion last summer. </p>\n<p>Revolut already has a waitlist of more than 350,000 people in India, she also said, which it plans to onboard by later this year before opening the app to new users. The exact launch timeline, however, will depend on how quickly the company clears the waitlist and customers complete their KYC and anti–money laundering (AML) checks.</p>\n<p>The startup is also exploring partners other than Visa, including the Indian government’s RuPay, as it ramps up the product to provide customers with a choice of networks.</p>\n<p>Revolut has <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ukinindia_british-fintech-company-revolut-is-preparing-activity-7377279905585307648-1e5i/\" target=\"_blank\">already infused $45 million</a> in India to kickstart its operations and to localize its entire tech stack to conform to the country’s data sovereignty regulations. It plans to invest more as it begins its operations, Chatterjee said.</p>\n<p>Of Revolut’s 10,000 employees worldwide, about 3,500 are already based in India — its largest workforce globally, even bigger than in its home market of the U.K. Some of these employees also work on the products and features available in markets outside India.</p>\n<p>But as significant as Revolut’s plans are, it will still face competition once it arrives. While foreign exchange is dominated by banks in India, fintech players such as Niyo, Scapia, Fi, and BookMyForex are already active in India’s cross-border and remittance market.</p>\n</div>"

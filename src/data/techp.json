    "body": "\nHome goods company Kohler recently unveiled a new device called the Dekoda — a $599 camera that can be attached to your toilet bowl and take pictures of what’s inside.\nCNET reports that the Dekoda analyzes these images in order to provide updates on your gut health and hydration, and to potentially detect blood. It also comes with a rechargeable battery, a USB connection, and a fingerprint sensor to identify who’s using the toilet.\nThe Dekoda is currently available for pre-order, with shipments scheduled to begin on October 21. In addition to the hardware purchase fee, customers will need to pay between $70 and $156 per year for a subscription.\nIf you’re uneasy about the privacy implications of putting a camera right below your private parts, the company says, “Dekoda’s sensors see down into your toilet and nowhere else.” It also notes that the resulting data is secured via end-to-end encryption.\nKohler isn’t the only company seeking to take pictures of your poop — we’ve also written about the toilet camera offered by a startup called Throne.\n"

The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market.\nAmazon did not give a reason for what caused the outage. \nBefore this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant Crowdstrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal.\nPrior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world’s largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam and the PlayStation Network.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA Waymo robotaxi was recently spotted driving around a school bus with its red lights flashing, and federal safety regulators have opened an investigation as a result.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced Monday morning that its Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an investigation after seeing footage from early October of a Waymo autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus that was unloading kids in Atlanta, Georgia.\nODI says in a document that it will investigate the performance of Waymo’s self-driving software around stopped school buses, how the system is designed to comply with rules related to the buses, and more. NHTSA said Monday that, based on its engagement with Waymo so far, the “likelihood of other prior similar incidents is high.” \nThe Waymo robotaxi in question crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. According to Waymo, the bus was partially blocking the driveway that the robotaxi was leaving. The company claims the robotaxi could not see the flashing lights or stop sign. Waymo did not immediately respond to a question about whether the vehicle could see the students getting off the bus, or the bus’s control arm.\n“Safety is our top priority, as we provide hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous paid trips every week in some of the most challenging driving environments in the U.S.,” the company said in a statement, while citing data that shows its vehicles get in fewer crashes than human-driven ones. “NHTSA plays a vital role in road safety, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the agency as part of our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver.” \nWaymo also said Monday that it has already issued software updates to its fleet to improve performance.\nThis has been a year of expansion for Waymo. The company launched in Atlanta, brought its robotaxis to Austin, expanded across Silicon Valley, and is testing in a number of other metro areas, including New York City. It’s also testing at the San Jose and San Francisco airports, and has many more cities lined up for 2026.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPart of the process of launching in new cities is having the self-driving system encounter and learn from new scenarios — although it’s safe to say Atlanta was not the first place that Waymo’s robotaxis have seen school buses.\nThis is not the first time NHTSA has opened an investigation into Waymo’s self-driving cars. In 2023, NHTSA probed reports that Waymo’s vehicles were struggling with roadway barriers like gates and chains in low-speed situations. That investigation ultimately led to a recall in 2024, which Waymo addressed with a software update. Last year, the agency announced a probe centered on reports that Waymo vehicles had driven into the wrong lane or entered construction zones.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Lurie’s visit signals a renewed effort to weave innovation back into San Francisco’s future. Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a +1 ticket.\n\nLurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the city’s economy and restoring its global standing, isn’t just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech’s impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.\nBy showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn’t retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It’s doubling down.\nFor TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn’t mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now, civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city’s rebound, he’ll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco’s best inventions haven’t been built yet.\nJust 7 days left to save on your pass and catch Mayor Lurie live\nIf you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won’t want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their +1 ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group. Disrupt doors open in exactly seven days at Moscone West.

    "body": "\nX is launching a marketplace for inactive handles that will allow Premium subscribers to request and purchase usernames. The marketplace will offer both free and paid options for requesting or acquiring eligible handles. Rare handles could be priced at anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, X says. \n“Priority” handles refers to usernames that often include full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations. These handles are free to request for Premium+ and Premium Business subscribers. If a user’s request is approved, X will transfer the handle to them for free. However, if a user cancels or downgrades their subscription, their old handle will return to their account after a 30-day grace period.\nX notes that examples of “Priority” handles include usernames like @GabrielJones, @PizzaEater, and @ParadoxAI.\nThe launch of the new marketplace will allow X to boost revenue through direct payments. It will also potentially increase interest in its Premium subscription offering, as it continues to deal with a struggling ads business.\nThe social network says not all requests are approved and that requests are usually reviewed within three business days. Once a request is approved, the user’s old handle is reserved and won’t be given to anyone else.\n“Rare” handles include short, generic, or culturally significant names. These handles won’t be available through standard requests and will instead be offered through public drops and direct, pre-priced purchases available by invitation only. \nFor public drops, multiple people can apply for the handle. X says selection is based on a user’s past contributions on the platform, their intended use of the handle, and their engagement and reach on the social network. \nAs for direct purchases, pricing is based on number of factors, such as popularity of the word, character length, and cultural significance. Once purchased, the user gets to keep the handle even if their Premium subscription ends.\nExamples of “Rare” handles include usernames like @Pizza, @Tom, and @One.\nX explained on a help page that it’s launching the marketplace instead of releasing inactive handles at once for anyone to claim because it wants to prevent bot spam or misuse, noting on that the marketplace “allows for fair and secure distribution through a controlled process.”\nIf a user has a specific inactive handle in mind that isn’t on the marketplace, they can “Register” their interest to add the handle to their Watchlist. It it becomes available, X will notify them. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

    "body": "\nCreative design giant Adobe is beefing up the products it offers businesses to include custom generative AI models. \nAdobe launched Adobe AI Foundry on Monday, a new offering that allows enterprises to work with the company to build custom generative AI models trained on their branding and intellectual property.\nThe foundry’s custom models, which can produce text, images, video, and other mediums like 3D scenes, are built off Adobe’s Firefly family of AI models. These Firefly models were launched in 2023 and have been trained entirely on licensed data. Adobe’s foundry service then fine tunes these models for each customer using their intellectual property. \nThe foundry service pricing is based on usage, as opposed to by seat like many of Adobe’s other products.\nHannah Elsakr, a vice president of generative AI new business ventures at Adobe, told TechCrunch the foundry service was a natural expansion of the company’s enterprise AI products — and customers were asking for more customization.\n“This is elevating a lot of the capabilities we already had,” Elsakr said. “The enterprise has asked us to come in and advise us, help us, partner with us, be our premier creative marketing AI partner on this.”\nSince Adobe released its Firefly models in 2023, enterprises have used them to create more than 25 billion assets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nElsakr said these custom models will help brands be able to better keep up with their advertising campaigns. A customer could create an ad campaign for a product once and use a custom Adobe model to help generate the same ad for different seasons, languages, or formats.\n“It’s highly personalized,” Elsakr said. “We’ve been talking about personalized commerce for so long, but generative AI and Firefly make it possible to put the brand in the hand of the consumer in an on-brand way.”\nDespite the capabilities of the new tools, Esakr said Adobe is not trying to replace human creatives by any means and rather just give them better versions of the tools they were already using to create their content.\n“Our stance is humanity is at the center of creativity and that can’t be replaced,” Elsakr said. “We have been for decades in the business of providing creative tooling that helps uplift narrative, telling storytelling, your ability to envision and execute your creative vision. Firefly and foundry are just the next evolution of giving you tools in the toolkit that elevate your ability to tell a story.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nOura announced on Monday that it’s launching a new redesigned app experience and a “Cumulative Stress” feature. The company also shared that it’s pursuing FDA clearance for blood pressure features that give users a likelihood assessment of hypertension. \nThe redesigned Oura app introduces more personalization with three main tabs. The “Today” tab surfaces the most relevant insights for daily decisions, and the “Vitals” tab provides at-a-glance views of things like sleep, stress, and cardiovascular trends. The “My Health” tab offers insights into the user’s long-term well-being, highlighting strengths, trends, and opportunities for proactive care. The tab also includes “Habits” and “Routines” sections to show the impact of daily actions.\nThe app redesign also brings enhanced menstrual cycle insights, including a 12-month view of period and fertile window predictions, up from the previous one-month view. \nImage Credits:Oura\nThe new Cumulative Stress feature helps users understand how their bodies accumulate and respond to chronic stress over time. It provides a stress measurement based on the past month of data and is updated weekly. A person’s Cumulative Stress is determined by five factors: sleep continuity, heart stress-response, sleep micro-motions, temperature regulation, and activity impact.\n“It’s much more than just tallying the hours spent in stressful periods,” Oura VP of Consumer Software Product, Jason Russell, told TechCrunch. “It’s actually measuring different bodily functions indicative of cumulative stress taking a toll on your body. So things like how your heart rate and heart rate variability respond after a period of stress is indicative of cumulative stress. Your thermodynamics. How you regulate temperature overnight, how continuous your sleep is. Whether you experience what we call sleep, micro-motions, so not just big movements during sleep, but twitches. There are little signatures that would be indicative of your body experiencing high cumulative stress.”\nThe new feature will roll out globally in the coming weeks.\nOn the road to developing an FDA-approved blood pressure feature, Oura announced that it’s introducing a new Blood Pressure Profile study to explore how the company can identify early signs of hypertension by passively tracking key signals in the background.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Oura\nOura received approval from the Institutional Review Board for the study, which is launching in experimental hub Oura Labs in the U.S. later this year. Users who are part of the study will be notified of their current likelihood of hypertension by combining Oura Ring data with a short check-in questionnaire on family history, medication, and lifestyle habits. They will receive an assessment that lets them know if they have no signs, moderate signs, or major signs of hypertension.\nMembers with strong signs will be encouraged to seek professional medical care. The algorithm will also track changes over time, prompting periodic reviews throughout the study, Oura says. \nMonday’s announcement comes a week after Oura raised $900 million in fresh funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Co., with participation from new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.\nIt also comes as Oura recently launched its Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection, its first-ever charging case, and a new Health Panels feature that lets members schedule blood work directly in the Oura app. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration is taking its social media attacks on Democratic opponents to an unlikely platform, with the White House and numerous other government agencies joining Bluesky on Friday.\nIn its first post, the new White House account uploaded a highlight reel of Trump footage and memes, along with the message, “What’s up, Bluesky? We thought you might’ve missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you.”\nOther government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the Department of War, and the Department of Transportation all appeared to follow the White House by creating new Bluesky accounts, and all of them quickly posted messages attacking Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown.\n“We heard this is a great place to have an open and honest dialogue, so we’re here to talk about how the Democrat shutdown is undermining our country on the world stage,” wrote the Department of State. (Legal experts have suggested that similar statements from government agencies likely violate the Hatch Act.)\nThe messages were generally written in a cheerful, trolling tone, suggesting that the administration’s social media teams were anticipating and even hoping for a negative response on a social network that’s widely known as a left-leaning alternative to Elon Musk’s X. And Bluesky users delivered, with many responses to the initial White House post bringing up Trump’s relationship with infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n“The reason they’re coming after this place is because they can’t control the people on it and it drives them nuts,” wrote The Onion CEO Ben Collins.\nAt the same time, many popular Bluesky accounts urged their followers to simply “block and move on,” with comedian Paul F Tomkins declaring that it’s “Weirdly fun to block the White House.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLess than 48 hours after joining, the White House has already become one of the most blocked accounts on Bluesky. According to ClearSky, which tracks Bluesky blocking stats, the White House account is blocked by around 91,000 accounts, while being followed by only 10,000. The only account that’s been blocked by more Bluesky users belongs to Vice President JD Vance, who joined back in June. \nWhile the various new government accounts hadn’t quite reached those heights by Sunday morning, they accounted for all of the top 5 most blocked accounts in the last 24 hours.  And other right-wing accounts seemed to be boasting about following the Trump administration to Bluesky and getting widely blocked.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nWikipedia is often described as the last good website on an internet increasingly filled with toxic social media and AI slop. But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to a new blog post from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.\nThe foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”\nWhy is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has disputed the claim that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)\nMiller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it paused the effort after editors complained.\nBut this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable, reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference on Friday.)\nFor that reason, he argues that AI, search, and social companies using content from Wikipedia “must encourage more visitors” to the website itself.\nAnd he says Wikipedia is taking steps of its own, for example by developing a new framework for attributing content from the encyclopedia. The organization also has two teams tasked with helping Wikipedia reach new readers, and it’s looking for volunteers to help.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMiller also encourages readers to “support content integrity and content creation” more broadly.\n“When you search for information online, look for citations and click through to the original source material,” he writes. “Talk with the people you know about the importance of trusted, human curated knowledge, and help them understand that the content underlying generative AI was created by real people who deserve their support.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nBilal Abu-Ghazaleh had just moved to London few days before our call, splitting his time between there and Dubai.\nAfter nearly a decade in the U.S., including a stint at Scale AI, he’s bringing that experience to his next venture: 1001 AI , a company creating AI infrastructure for critical industries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\nThe startup recently raised a $9 million seed round led by CIV, General Catalyst, and Lux Capital. Other backers include global and regional angels such as Chris Ré, Amjad Masad (Replit), Amira Sajwani (DAMAC), Khalid Bin Bader Al Saud (RAED Ventures), and Hisham Alfalih (Lean Technologies).\nAbu-Ghazaleh said his two-month-old company promises to cut inefficiencies in high-stakes sectors like aviation, logistics, and oil and gas through an AI-native operating system for decision-making. \n“Just looking at the top three or four industries like airports, ports, construction, and oil and gas, we see more than $10 billion in inefficiencies across the Gulf alone,” the founder and CEO said in an interview with TechCrunch. “That’s just in markets like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Even without counting other sectors, these industries represent a massive opportunity.”\nFor example, any efficiencies found in airport operations can compound the savings, impacting both the airport and its airlines. Meanwhile, he said nine out of ten of the regions mega-projects fall behind schedule or go over budget, meaning even small increases in efficiencies can save these projects serious money. \n1001 AI hopes to sell its decision-making AI to new projects after it launches its first product, which is scheduled by year’s end. The startup is in talks with some of the Gulf’s largest construction firms and airports, said Abu-Ghazaleh.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBorn and raised in Jordan, Abu-Ghazaleh moved to the U.S. for college and later joined the Bay Area’s startup scene. After an early product role at computer vision startup Hive AI, he joined Scale AI in 2020 during its rapid expansion. There, he rose through the ranks from operations associate to director of the company’s GenAI operations, scaling its contributor network responsible for annotating and labeling training data.\nHe was later set to join Scale’s international public sector unit, which builds AI solutions for foreign governments. But when Meta invested in Scale, the company shifted direction, and Abu-Ghazaleh left to found 1001 AI.\nThe Gulf, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has become one of the world’s most aggressive adopters of AI. From sovereign-backed ventures like G42 in Abu Dhabi to Saudi Arabia’s National Center for AI, governments are investing billions to build local AI infrastructure and attract global talent.\nFor Abu-Ghazaleh, that mix of appetite, budget, and urgency makes the region a perfect testing ground. But unlike most AI startups focused on software or enterprise tools, 1001 targets real-world physical operations, an area where the company’s investors believe the potential is even greater in the Middle East.\n“We’re extremely bullish on AI that solves physical-world problems at scale i.e, optimizing how airports turn around flights, how ports move cargo, how construction sites operate,” said Deena Shakir, partner at Lux Capital. “The MENA region offers significant potential in this space with mission-critical infrastructure that’s under-digitized and ripe for transformation.”\nWhile the product is still under development, Abu-Ghazaleh offered a glimpse into how it works. The system pulls in data from a client’s existing software, models operational workflows, and issues real-time directives to improve efficiency.\n“Today, an operations manager might manually call someone to reroute a fuel truck or send a cleaning crew to another gate,” said Abu-Ghazaleh. “With our system, that orchestration happens automatically. The AI orchestrator uses real-time data to reroute vehicles, reassign crews, and adjust operations without human intervention.”\nUnlike most early-stage AI startups that target specific industries, Abu-Ghazaleh says 1001 can be accessible by many because operational flows across industries often look the same.\nThat model borrows from the rigor of consulting and contract work. The team spends weeks embedded with clients, running co-development sprints to tailor its systems to each operation’s realities, the CEO said. \n“Bilal is building the decision engine to automate that complexity with Scale-proven execution and the regional gravity to make 1001 the platform this market builds on,” commented Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst.\nThe new funding will accelerate early deployments across aviation, logistics, and infrastructure, while fueling recruitment in engineering, operations, and go-to-market role as it grows its team across Dubai and London. \n1001 AI plans to launch its first customer deployment by the end of the year, starting with construction. Over the next five years, Abu-Ghazaleh wants the company to become the Gulf’s go-to orchestration layer for these industries before expanding globally.\n"

    "body": "\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Want another reason to get this free in your inbox? The emailed version of this newsletter includes polls, including one this week that asks readers what they think the best business model is for autonomous vehicle technology. Have an opinion about this? Email me your opinion at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com with the subject line “AV poll.”\nOK, back to the show. There’s another twist in the road for lidar company Luminar. And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. \nFirst, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. \nHe popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. \nSenior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. \nThis may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.)\nThe implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts.\nDeals!\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nTwo notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. \nFirst up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion.\nThe SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nAnd there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. \nArcher won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. \nThe question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. \nOther deals that got my attention this week …\nAirbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined.\nDexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe.\nFleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A.\nPony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange.\nStarship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined.\nUpciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures.\nZepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards.\nStellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform.\nWhile Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. \nUber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models.\nWaymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo.\nAs per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is. \nOne more thing …\nSpeaking of Waymo and delivery, it got me thinking about what the best business model is. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a poll, so I hope you participate if you sign up for the newsletter. I will share the results next week.\n"

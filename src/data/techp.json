The company is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue, with 70% coming from everyday people paying $20 a month to chat with an AI, according to the Financial Times. That’s pretty wild when you consider ChatGPT has 800 million regular users,  but only 5% are actually paying subscribers.\nRaking in billions though it may be, OpenAI has also committed to spending over $1 trillion over the next decade (yes, trillion). The company has recently locked in deals for more than 26 gigawatts of computing capacity from Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — infrastructure that’ll cost vastly more than what’s coming in.\nTo bridge this gap, OpenAI is getting creative, reports the FT. A five-year-plan includes exploring government contracts, shopping tools, video services, consumer hardware, and even becoming a computing supplier itself through its Stargate data center project.\nA growing number of businesses need to math to work out. Some of America’s most valuable companies are now leaning on OpenAI to fulfill major contracts, notes the FT; if OpenAI falters (no pressure!), it could potentially destabilize the broader U.S. market.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

Facebook also says it will provide tailored recommendations for relevant opportunities based on users’ job browsing history. After submitting their applications, they can chat with companies via Messenger to arrange interviews.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nThe job listings feature initially launched in 2017 in the U.S. and Canada, and then expanded to over 40 countries a year later. However, in 2022, Facebook limited its support to only the U.S. and Canada, ultimately discontinuing the feature in 2023, likely due to the increasing use of LinkedIn.\nMeta didn’t explain why it chose to bring back job listings now. However, it seems like it’s trying to go back to its roots and expand its purpose beyond just social networking. Back in January, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned wanting to see a “return to OG Facebook” as one of his big goals this year during the Q4 earnings call. This could also be a way for Facebook to appeal to younger people who are just starting out in their careers and to draw in more Gen Z users. \nPlus, by prioritizing entry-level, trade, and service industry positions, Facebook aims to differentiate itself from LinkedIn, which tends to cater to medium- and high-skilled job roles. Facebook has more than 3 billion monthly active users, while LinkedIn is catching up with over 1 billion users.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

    "body": "\nCoinbase has increased its investment in India’s CoinDCX, valuing the exchange at $2.45 billion post-money, as the U.S. crypto giant bets on the country’s digital-asset potential even as regulation remains unclear.\nThe investment is an extension of CoinDCX’s previous funding round and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said on Wednesday. They did not disclose the amount invested or the size of Coinbase’s stake, but noted that the new round increased the Indian exchange’s valuation from $2.15 billion in its last raise in April 2022.\nCoinDCX confirmed to TechCrunch that the latest funding is an investment of new capital by Coinbase. The U.S. exchange has been an investor in CoinDCX since 2020 and last backed the Indian exchange in its Series D round in 2022 through its venture capital arm, Coinbase Ventures.\nNotably, the funding comes just months after CoinDCX suffered a security breach in July that led to the theft of around $44 million worth of assets. It comes amid reports earlier this year suggesting that Coinbase was acquiring CoinDCX — claims that the Indian exchange’s CEO denied at the time.\n“This investment adds to our growing presence in the region, where we also maintain local operations and other important local partners,” said Coinbase’s chief business officer, Shan Aggarwal, in a blog post. “Taken together, these steps reflect a clear commitment: we believe India and its neighbors will help shape the future of the global onchain economy.”\nMore than a year after ceasing operations in India, Coinbase re-entered the market earlier this year by registering with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit. The U.S. exchange is also an investor in CoinSwitch, another leading Indian crypto platform.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country and home to more than a billion internet subscribers, is a key market for U.S. tech giants. However, the South Asian nation remains a relatively small market for crypto, partly due to regulatory uncertainty and the government’s flat 30% tax on digital asset gains, along with a 1% levy on each transaction. New Delhi also restricts offshore crypto exchanges unless they register with its financial watchdog. Recently, 25 global platforms — including BingX, LBank, and CoinW — came under government scrutiny for failing to register and comply with anti–money laundering rules.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCoinbase’s move to double down on CoinDCX to expand its presence in India makes strategic sense, as the Indian exchange has a strong local footprint with more than 20.4 million users. In July, CoinDCX reported customer assets exceeding ₹100 billion (about $1.12 billion), annualized group revenue of ₹11.79 billion (around $133 million), and annualized transaction volumes across products totaling ₹13.7 trillion (roughly $154.6 billion).\nIn addition to India, CoinDCX expanded into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) last year by acquiring BitOasis. Coinbase could leverage that footprint to strengthen its presence in the region, one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally.\nThe new capital will be used to enhance products, drive user growth, expand into new geographies, and deepen educational initiatives, CoinDCX said in a statement.\n“We see strong synergies with Coinbase in building a compliant and regulatory-friendly crypto ecosystem in India, MENA, and beyond,” Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, said.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

According to YouTube, these videos come from reputable sources and are tailored to the developmental stage of teenagers. The company collaborated with organizations that specialize in mental health and well-being information for young people, such as the Child Mind Institute.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nThis launch signifies a move toward making YouTube a trustworthy resource for younger users facing mental health challenges. A 2023 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 39.7% of students felt ongoing sadness and hopelessness, while 28.5% reported poor mental health.\nThis is a notable addition for the platform as it’s important to reach teens where they already seek information, such as YouTube, with nine out of 10 teens reporting they use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the years, YouTube has invested in various initiatives to assist teenagers. These include implementing specific safeguards when recommending certain topics to teens, using age-estimation technology to recognize teenage users for a more suitable experience, and providing parental controls that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens’ accounts.\nThe new mental health and well-being offering is rolling out to users in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia in the coming weeks. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nStellantis, the international automaker that owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO.\nFive new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The investment will also support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. In all, more than 5,000 jobs will be created.\nUnlike previous multibillion-dollar investment pledges, however, this one doesn’t focus on electrification.\nOne of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV — a vehicle that combines a battery with a gas generator for additional range — produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028. The automaker also plans to produce a large, new, gas-powered SUV at the Warren plant.\nThe remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its Kokomo, Indiana, factory.\nImage Credits:Stellantis\nStellantis CEO and North America COO Antonio Filosa said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint, and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.”\n“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStellantis has scaled back its electrification plans for the U.S. market in the past year. The automaker said in September it would no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassessed its product strategy. Earlier that month, the automaker said it canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup. However, Stellantis said it still planned to produce an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, formerly called the Ramcharger. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

While users can now hide sponsored results, the “Sponsored” label will remain visible as they scroll — making ads persistent even when collapsed. Additional changes include new sports updates in Search and AI-driven topic previews in the Discover feed, launching first in the U.S., South Korea, and India.",
    "body": "\nGoogle is rolling out a series of changes to its Search and Discover pages, the company shared across multiple announcements. The updates will bring new AI-powered features to these key destinations, while also improving navigation and allowing users to collapse ads on Google Search.\nGiven that ads are Google’s primary cash cow, the latter initially seems like a more surprising change. The feature will now allow users browsing Google’s Search results to tap a new button, “Hide sponsored results,” to collapse the ads at the top of the search results page.\nImage Credits:Google\nHowever, while this action will remove the ads from displaying on the screen, sponsored results are not going away entirely. Instead, Google notes that the “Sponsored Results” label will remain at the top of the screen as you scroll down. In a way, this makes the ads more prominent as they can follow you down the page, even though they’re collapsed.\nPlus, Google says that the “Sponsored results” header can appear both above and below AI Overviews — the short AI-written summaries that appear at the top of search results to provide quick answers. The “Sponsored results” header for text ads will also appear at the bottom of the page, with all text ads grouped under the label. These can be collapsed with the same “Hide sponsored results” button if you want to focus on organic content.\nGoogle says the new design makes it easier for people to navigate to the top of the page, and it keeps the size of ads the same, with users never seeing more than four text ads in a group. \nThe new “Sponsored” label will show up in other places across Google, too, including Shopping ads, where it will be branded as “Sponsored Products.”\nThe updates will roll out across desktop and mobile.\nThe company is also making other changes across Search and Discover. When searching for sports information, like looking up players or teams, you’ll now see a new “What’s New” button that displays a feed of trending updates and news articles that could help you catch up with the latest. This will roll out to Google Search in the U.S. in the weeks ahead.\nMeanwhile, the Google app’s Discover feed on mobile will introduce an AI-powered feature that also helps you keep up with trending topics you’re interested in. Here, the app will display short previews that you can expand to see more information, plus other links to explore. The company says this feature is designed to help users stay up to date on stories from a variety of publishers, but it also comes at a time when publishers are seeing their search traffic decline due to the shift to AI-provided answers and consumers’ changing media habits.\nThis latter feature is rolling out now to the U.S., South Korea, and India. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced in a post on X Tuesday the company will soon relax some of ChatGPT’s safety restrictions, allowing users to make the chatbot’s responses friendlier or more “human-like,” and for “verified adults” to engage in erotic conversations.\n“We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,” said Altman. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”\n\nWe made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.Now that we have…— Sam Altman (@sama) October 14, 2025\n\nThe announcement is a notable pivot from OpenAI’s months-long effort to address the concerning relationships that some mentally unstable users have developed with ChatGPT. Altman seems to declare an early victory over these problems, claiming OpenAI has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” around ChatGPT. However, the company has provided little to no evidence for this, and is now plowing ahead with plans for ChatGPT to engage in sexual chats with users.\nSeveral concerning stories emerged this summer around ChatGPT, specifically its GPT-4o model, suggesting the AI chatbot could lead vulnerable users down delusional rabbit holes. In one case, ChatGPT seemed to convince a man he was a math genius who needed to save the world. In another, the parents of a teenager sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT encouraged their son’s suicidal ideations in the weeks leading up to his death.\nIn response, OpenAI released a series of safety features to address AI sycophancy: the tendency for an AI chatbot to hook users by agreeing with whatever they say, even negative behaviors. \nOpenAI launched GPT-5 in August, a new AI model that exhibits lower rates of sycophancy and features a router that can identify concerning user behavior. A month later, OpenAI launched safety features for minors, including an age prediction system and a way for parents to control their teen’s ChatGPT account. OpenAI announced Tuesday the formation of an expert council of mental health professionals to advise the company on well-being and AI.\nJust a few months after these concerning stories emerged, OpenAI seems to think ChatGPT’s problems around vulnerable users are under control. It’s unclear whether users are still falling down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5. And while GPT-4o is no longer the default in ChatGPT, the AI model is still available today and being used by thousands of people.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introduction of erotica in ChatGPT is unchartered territory for OpenAI and raises broader concerns around how vulnerable users will interact with the new features. While Altman insists OpenAI isn’t “usage-maxxing” or optimizing for engagement, making ChatGPT more erotic could certainly draw users in.\nAllowing chatbots to engage in romantic or erotic role play has been an effective engagement strategy for other AI chatbot providers, such as Character.AI. The company has gained tens of millions of users, many of whom use its chatbots at a high rate. Character.AI said in 2023 that users spent an average of two hours a day talking to its chatbots. The company is also facing a lawsuit around how it handles vulnerable users.\nOpenAI is under pressure to grow its user base. While ChatGPT is already used by 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is racing against Google and Meta to build mass-adopted AI-powered consumer products. The company has also raised billions of dollars for a historic infrastructure buildout, an investment OpenAI eventually needs to pay back.\nWhile adults are surely having romantic relationships with AI chatbots, it’s also quite popular for minors. A new report from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that 19% of high school students have either had a romantic relationship with an AI chatbot, or know a friend who has.\nAltman says OpenAI will soon allow erotica for “verified adults.” An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch the company will rely on the age-prediction system it’s building to ensure that ChatGPT’s erotic features are only available to adult users.\nAs Altman previously wrote in a blog post, if OpenAI’s age-prediction system incorrectly marks an adult as a minor, ChatGPT users may have to upload a picture of their government-issued ID into ChatGPT to correct it. Altman writes that, though this is a privacy compromise, the company believes it’s a “worthy tradeoff.”\nIt is unclear whether OpenAI will extend erotica to its AI voice, image, and video generation tools.\nAltman claims that OpenAI is also making ChatGPT friendlier and erotic because of the company’s “treat adult users like adults” principle. Over the last year, OpenAI has shifted towards a more lenient content moderation strategy for ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to be more permissive and offer less refusals. In February, OpenAI pledged to represent more political viewpoints in ChatGPT, and in March, the company updated ChatGPT to allow AI-generated images of hate symbols.\nThese policies seem to be an attempt to make ChatGPT’s response more popular with a wide variety of users. However, vulnerable ChatGPT users may benefit from safeguards that limit what a chatbot can engage with. As OpenAI races towards a billion weekly active users, the tension between growth and protecting vulnerable users may only grow.\nUpdate 10/14/25 at 4:40pm PT: This story has been updated to include comment from OpenAI.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "description": "Sonic Fire Tech has developed a device that can extinguish flames using acoustic energy below the range of human hearing. The startup is building a demo capable of protecting a home.",
    "body": "\nA decade ago, two college students built a fire extinguisher that snuffed out a fire using nothing more than a booming 10-inch subwoofer. The internet lapped it up, and Jimmy Fallon even booked a demonstration for “The Tonight Show.”\nBut since that brief viral moment, there hasn’t been much more than a whisper about the technology.\nIt’s not for lack of trying. The college kids weren’t the first to prove the concept. DARPA was on the case in 2012; and a search of the scientific literature reveals dozens of researchers investigating the idea.\nOne startup now claims to have cracked the problem. Sonic Fire Tech has built an acoustic fire suppression system that doesn’t just extinguish flames, it might also protect homes and other buildings from wildfires. The startup has raised a $3.5 million seed round from investors, including Khosla Ventures and Third Sphere, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nWildfires cost the U.S. as much as $424 billion annually. The problem has become so acute in places like California that insurers are refusing to renew policies after repeated blazes have reduced large swathes of the state to ashes.\nSonic Fire Tech has been developing its technology over the last several years. Michael Thomas, who is chairman of the startup’s board, had been tinkering with the idea of using sound to fight fires, and when he hit a wall, he reached out to Geoff Bruder over LinkedIn. Bruder had worked for NASA, where he focused on heat and acoustics. \n“This is kind of a new-age founding story,” Bruder, the startup’s CEO and CTO, told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBruder was intrigued with Thomas’ idea and set about building a prototype. “I got a subwoofer and some parts from Home Depot and AutoZone and said, ‘Hey, let’s see if we can do any better than other people had,’” Bruder recalled. “We knocked a fire out from seven feet in my driveway.”\n\n\n\nThe startup soon ditched the subwoofer and moved to lower frequencies. The problem with audible frequencies is that any system powerful enough to suppress a fire would be damaging to people’s hearing, Bruder said. “You’ve basically got to throw a speaker design in the trash and start from scratch,” he said.\nThere are competing theories as to how exactly acoustic energy can disrupt combustion, but the soundless demonstrations certainly suggest that Sonic Fire Tech is onto something.\nThe new system uses a reciprocating piston much like those inside a car’s engine, but it is significantly larger. An electric motor turns a crankshaft, which pulses the two-foot piston to produce infrasound, the technical term for sound that’s below people’s hearing range, or about 20 Hz. \n“Since we designed everything ourselves, we dropped the frequency to where we’re below audible range, which helps us transmit further, and it makes it safe,” Bruder said.\nSonic Fire Tech’s current record is 25 feet. A bigger system could work as far away as 330 feet, Bruder said. The company plans to sell and install its system for about 2% of a home’s value, and it’s talking with insurance companies to qualify the technology. \nTo protect a house, Sonic Fire Tech routes infrasound from a single generator through rigid ducts that sit on the roof’s ridge and under the eaves. On the ridge, they fire down the pitch to catch any fires that might start in debris in the gutters. Under the eaves, they are aimed toward the ground to suppress any flames that pop up near the walls. The system turns on when sensors detect a flame.\nA home-based system draws around 500 watts of electricity, and in case of a power outage, Sonic Fire Tech is drawing up plans to use lead-acid batteries for backup. Unlike sprinkler systems, it doesn’t require a source of water, which can be in short supply in wildfire country.\nThe startup is working with PG&E and Southern California Edison to demonstrate the technology on homes, and it has signed a letter of intent with a chemical storage facility. \n“The natural progression is, if we get certified as a sprinkler replacement, then you can just run a pipe into your house and protect your kitchen and everywhere you would need to protect,” Bruder said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you’re emailing to set up a meeting.\nThe company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings.\nThe launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users’ everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google’s latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more.\nImage Credits:Google\nTo use the meeting scheduling option, you’ll click the new “Help me schedule” button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people’s calendars. \nWhile there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini’s AI to use the email’s context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they’d like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule.\nGoogle previously offered an appointment scheduling feature in Google Calendar, but it wasn’t integrated with Gmail, nor did it use AI.\nSeparately, Google updated another Workplace feature on Tuesday, noting that Google Keep reminders will now automatically be saved to Google Tasks.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:53 AM PDT · October 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nImpulse Space laid out an ambitious plan Tuesday to use its tech to haul tons of cargo to the moon as early as 2028, aiming to fill what it sees as a gap in today’s market for mid-sized surface deliveries.\nThe company says it will pair a new lunar lander with its “Helios” high-energy kick stage to move tons to the surface without needing to refuel on orbit. The aim is to deliver up to 6 tons of payload to the moon across two missions “at a cost-effective price point.”\nThe startup, founded by former SpaceX propulsion chief Tom Mueller, argues this capacity would fill a “critical gap” in lunar payload logistics for cargo too big to fit on landers part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program and too small for the forthcoming human-rated landers that are being developed by SpaceX and Blue Origin.\nImpulse says payloads that hit this mark are roughly 0.5 to 13 tons, a range that could include rovers, habitat modules, power generators, comms systems, or even a lunar terrain vehicle.\nUnder the proposed architecture, the lander and kick stage would launch on a standard rocket where they would be deployed in low Earth orbit. Helios would transport the lander to low lunar orbit within seven days, after which the two vehicles would separate, and the lander would descend to the surface.\nImpulse is bringing to the table deep expertise in spacecraft engine development; it is already at work on the lunar lander engine, which uses the same fuel combination as the Saiph thrusters used on the company’s small spacecraft Mira.\nMeanwhile, Helios is “already well into development,” with the first flight scheduled for late 2026. The company estimates it will be flying Helios multiple times per year by 2028.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExecution risks remain. As the company points out, a lunar lander engine needs to be throttleable, able to restart, and with a high specific impulse to provide ultra-control in the vacuum of space. Impulse seemed to be hedging its bets in a press release, saying, “we stand ready to execute as dictated by industry demand and interest.” But if the company can deliver, it would open up an entirely new lunar delivery schedule.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWalmart announced on Tuesday a new partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to shop Walmart’s products via the AI chatbot, including things like groceries (not fresh food), household essentials, and more, and then instantly check out.\nThe agentic shopping feature will also allow Sam’s Club members to plan meals and restock essentials while also discovering new items when chatting with the AI, the company says.\nTo use the feature, customers will press a “buy” button in ChatGPT’s app when they shop, after linking their Walmart accounts to ChatGPT. Products from third-party sellers will also be supported when the feature rolls out later this fall. \nWalmart explains that the new agreement with OpenAI will allow the retailer to better learn and predict customers’ needs, making online shopping more personalized and proactive, instead of only reactive. \nThe partnership follows OpenAI’s recent announcement of its plan to enter the world of e-commerce with an agentic shopping system, which includes product discovery, recommendation, and payments. Initially, OpenAI is teaming up with Etsy and Shopify sellers, the company said. \nThe ChatGPT-focused shopping feature won’t be the only way consumers can shop with AI. Alongside other AI investments, Walmart recently introduced its own generative AI shopping assistant, Sparky, designed to help customers discover and compare products and make purchases. The feature will expand to include reordering, service booking, and understanding multimodal inputs from text, images, audio, and video.\nThe retailer has an existing relationship with OpenAI in other areas of its business, as well, having adopted OpenAI Certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise for its internal teams. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club broadly use AI to do other things, like speeding up fashion production by up to 18 weeks and improving customer care time frames by up to 40%.\n“For many years now, e-commerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change,” noted Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon in a prepared statement. “There is a native AI experience coming that is multimedia, personalized, and contextual. We are running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future with Sparky and through partnerships, including this important step with OpenAI,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSpaceX is quietly standing up a volunteer fire department to serve the sprawling launch-and-manufacturing Starbase complex, tightening its control over emergency response at a site known for rapid — and sometimes explosive — rocket development. \nA certificate of formation filed with the Texas Secretary of State on June 30 shows the creation of what’s called the Starbase Volunteer Fire Department. The nonprofit entity lists its headquarters as 1 Rocket Road in Brownsville, the principal address of SpaceX. Two of the three directors named on the filing are SpaceX employees: Cody Dye, environmental health and safety manager, and Kevin Bagnall, in-house counsel. The certificate is signed by another SpaceX lawyer, Stephen Herndon. \nThe filing says the organization will “aid, promote and provide for the establishment of systems and facilities for the provision of public safety education, and fire prevention and suppression services.” \nAnother new document posted by the city of Starbase late Tuesday confirms the new volunteer fire department was started by SpaceX employees, and that the new municipality plans to sign a contract with it to “provide Fire Protection Services for all persons and property within the city limits.” That agreement will last for three years before it needs to be renewed.\nSpaceX has historically handled fires at Starbase, which was recently incorporated as its own Texas city, with a combination of an internal firefighting and emergency response team and help from local fire departments, such as the one in nearby Brownsville. \nIt’s unclear what impact the new volunteer fire department will have on those external relationships, and when asked, Cameron County directed TechCrunch to submit a public information act request. At the time of publication, Cameron County had not responded to that request. \nSpaceX, Brownsville Fire Department, and Starbase city officials did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s also unclear whether the Starbase Volunteer Fire Department is connected to the county’s 911-dispatch system. As it is a volunteer fire department, it is not regulated by the Texas Commission on Fire Protection, which is only authorized to regulate local government fire departments, agency chief Mike Wisko said. \nThe new volunteer fire department was established just months after Starbase became an officially incorporated city in Texas. That has led SpaceX and Starbase city officials — most of whom are current or former SpaceX employees — to exercise more authority over the corner of Texas they occupy. The company town announced in September a deal with Cameron County to take partial control of the beach near the launch complex. Starbase installed gates in June to control public access to the city.\nThe formation of the new volunteer fire department coincided with the end of a separate arrangement: SpaceX’s funding of an emergency fire marshal position inside Cameron County.\nDuring an August 26 commissioners meeting, officials acknowledged SpaceX had been funding a fire marshal within the county’s emergency-management office. “There was a position that was being funded through an agreement for services with SpaceX. That contract … is terminating,” deputy county administrator Xavier Villarreal told commissioners.\nHe said the county was in the process to continue funding the fire marshal position with a new partner, liquid natural gas developer NextDecade. \nThe duties of a fire marshal include reviewing plans and inspecting buildings for fire-safety compliance. SpaceX may have funded the position, which Villareal acknowledged was “for inspections” and permits, in order to ensure the county could keep up with the increased workload as construction surged. Villarreal did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\nStarbase is now handling fire-code oversight. The city has appointed two people from the same fire plan review and building inspection vendor, SAFEbuilt, for the task. Cliff Nevins has been appointed as fire marshal and Wade Cain is a building official.\nTaken together, the new volunteer fire department and the two SAFEbuilt appointments suggest Starbase has internalized fire-code approvals, using a vendor it appoints while shifting emergency response to a company-affiliated organization.\nThis differs from how the new city of Starbase is handling law enforcement. The company town has arranged a deal with Cameron County where two sheriffs will patrol Starbase per shift. Starbase also has access to the county’s jails for a cost of $100 per inmate per day. And in the document posted Tuesday, the city of Starbase agrees to seek other vendors for emergency medical services and arson investigation.\nThe differing approach has turned at least one local head. In response to Starbase terminating the fire marshal funding agreement at the August meeting, one commissioner responded, “But they can’t hire police officers? Interesting.” \nStarbase’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 sets aside just $60,000 for the volunteer fire department, a modest sum compared to the $1.3 million allocated to the law enforcement contracts with the county. The disparity suggests that SpaceX itself may be footing much of the bill for equipment and other expenses.\nThe shift comes as SpaceX continues to expand its launch operations at Starbase. SpaceX’s rapid-prototyping approach to development has led to a number of fires and explosions at the facility. In June, following a test firing of the company’s Super Heavy booster, a malfunction triggered a dramatic fireball that was visible for miles and caused panicked nearby residents to flood local dispatch with calls. No injuries were reported. \nThis story has been updated with new information from a document posted to the city of Starbase website.\n\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

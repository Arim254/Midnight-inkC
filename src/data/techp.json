    "body": "\nElevenLabs struck a deal with actors Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to AI-generate their voices, the company announced this week.\nHollywood and AI have an up-and-down relationship, with its guardrails — or lack thereof — serving among the main concerns that led to the Hollywood strikes a few years ago. Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI.\nLast year, Meta announced that its Meta AI would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice.\nElevenLabs also announced this week that it was launching a marketplace to let brands use authorized AI-generated voices of celebrities, which will include Caine and other names like Liza Minnelli and Dr. Maya Angelou. ElevenLabs is one of the more popular AI unicorn companies and has backers including a16z and ICONIQ.  \n\n\tTopics\n"

    "body": "\nThe solar activity that’s been lighting up the night sky across North America this week is now causing Jeff Bezos’ space company to push back the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nJust hours before the scheduled launch on Wednesday, Blue Origin said it is standing down from the attempt due to the solar activity and its “potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft” — a Mars-bound science mission the company is carrying to space for NASA. A new launch date has not yet been announced.\nNew Glenn’s first launch in January was mostly a successful demonstration mission of the rocket. Blue Origin delayed the second launch multiple times, though, and the company is being cautious since this is the first time the rocket has a commercial payload onboard. \nNew Glenn nearly took off this past Sunday, but weather concerns and an errant cruise ship in the flight path, plus some issues with the launch pad equipment, caused the company to shelve the attempt.\n"

(Users who use an authenticator app are unaffected.)\nX said this was part of an effort to retire the older twitter.com domain, which currently redirects to x.com. That change took effect in May 2024. The problem is that passkeys and security keys are digitally tied to the old twitter.com domain and can’t be transferred to x.com. That means users have to manually un-enroll and re-enroll using the new x.com domain.\nAs part of the switchover, X warned that after November 10, customers would have their accounts locked until they re-enroll or choose another method of two-factor authentication. \nNow that the deadline has passed, plenty of users are reporting that they’ve been locked out of their accounts and can’t re-enroll their passkey or security key, citing error messages or getting caught in an endless loop.\nThis is the latest issue to beset X, now owned by Elon Musk after he bought Twitter, as it was known then, for $44 billion. Since taking charge of the social networking site, the company has experienced massive layoffs and countless controversies.\nX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk, who now owns X, has been posting as usual, presumably unaffected by the change.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The acquirer is the music and technology company Stingray Group, which will pay $150 million at closing and up to $25 million one year later.\nIt financed the deal with a loan under its renewed credit facility, the company said on Wednesday.\nFounded in 2002, TuneIn was an early player in the online music space. Unlike rivals such as Apple Music or Spotify Premium that offer ad-free, subscription-based music on demand, TuneIn focused on streaming traditional radio stations over the internet. This business model also allowed TuneIn to deliver a wide variety of content beyond music, like news, talk, and live sports. The company attempted to monetize this content through a paid subscription that also included audiobooks and ad-free radio channels.\nHowever, the company struggled to compete in the crowded streaming market, particularly as consumer demand for talk radio shifted to podcasts, and people grew comfortable paying for ad-free music subscriptions.\nStingray, a Montreal-based company that owns radio stations and provides music tech and advertising services, acquired TuneIn to expand its reach, particularly through partnerships with device manufacturers, automakers, and content providers. The company noted that TuneIn’s content is available on more than 200 platforms and connected devices, including over 50 in-car audio systems, spanning more than 100 countries.\nThe $175 million purchase price was based on TuneIn’s forecasted sales of $110 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025. TuneIn has over 75 million monthly active listeners worldwide.\nStingray says the TuneIn brand will remain.

    "body": "\nWhen former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt, someone from the audience asked him if HBO’s hit satire “Silicon Valley” would be revived. Costolo, who was a writer for the show, essentially answered no (at timestamp 38:17).\nWhile the writers talk about that regularly, he said, they don’t pursue it because today’s actual Silicon Valley is so bizarre, it can’t be parodied.  \nThe latest case in point is a new company called Clad Labs that launched out of Y Combinator this week. Clad’s product is so outside-the-box that people thought it was an April Fools’ joke in November. \nBut it’s a real product, founder Richard Wang told TechCrunch. The product is called “Chad: The Brainrot IDE.” It is yet another vibe coding integrated development environment — an IDE is the software developers use to code — but with a twist. While waiting for the AI coding tool to finish its task, the developer can mess around with their favorite brainrot activities within a window of the IDE. \nOr, as the company’s website advertises: “Gamble while you code. Watch TikToks. Swipe on Tinder. Play minigames. This isn’t a joke — it’s Chad IDE, and it’s solving the biggest productivity problem in AI-powered development that nobody’s talking about.” \nThe founders say their IDE increases productivity by helping with “context switching.” Their argument is, by doing your brainrot activities within the IDE itself, as soon as the AI is done with the task, you’ll get right back to work rather than be focused on your phone or browser. \nReaction on X was mixed. While some people thought it was a fake satire, others thought it was a good — or a terrible — idea.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLike it or hate it, everyone had an opinion, even Jordi Hays, co-host of the enthusiastically pro-tech podcast TBPN. Hays penned a post on the product called, “Rage Baiting is for Losers.” In it he said of Chad IDE: “On one hand it’s funny. On the other hand, what are we doing here and why does this belong on the official YC account?” \nHe argued that products like Chad IDE and Cluely have moved rage bait from a marketing gimmick to a “product strategy” and “it really should not be.” He urged YC to start teaching founders that “rage baiting is for losers.” \nThis is particularly interesting advice from someone who, as a founder, had mastered viral marketing without rage. Hays and his wife Sarah founded Party Round, a funding startup that went viral for their friendly marketing gimmicks like launching NFT versions of top “helpful” VCs. (Party Round rebranded to Capital and sold to Rho in 2024.) \nWang tells TechCrunch what the haters don’t get about his brainrot IDE is that it wasn’t intended to be rage bait. The founders hope it becomes a genuinely beloved AI vibe coder for consumer-app type developers. They want to give these folks a consumer app-like experience in an IDE.\nWhile the product is real, it’s not available to the public yet. \n”We’re currently in a closed beta,” Wang said. Right now, Chad is attempting to build a “community” of users who like the idea. Clad Labs hopes to open the product to the public soon, but for now, users must get an invite from someone already in the beta.\nNo doubt there’s a certain type of developer who would love Chad. But whatever the future holds for this product, one thing is true: It is nearly impossible to parody Silicon Valley these days. \n"

    "body": "\nSearch and rescue missions often happen in areas that are difficult for humans to navigate due to extreme weather, rough terrain, or dangerous conditions like smoke or dust.\nA researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) wants to send robots inspired by bats on these missions instead of humans.\nNitin J. Sanket, a professor at WPI, has developed small flying robots with his team that fit in the palm of a hand and use ultrasound — just like bats. These robots use AI-powered software to filter out noise from the ultrasound signals the devices collect, allowing them to spot obstacles within a two-meter radius.\n“Search and rescue is done on foot,” Sanket told TechCrunch. “There are a lot of people who go on foot with flashlights in really harsh conditions and put their lives at danger to save others. We thought drones are the answer because they can cover a lot of ground really fast. They can be agile and quick.”\nNitin Sanket.Image Credits:Nitin Sanket / WPI\nSanket has long been fascinated by aerial robots and drones and how the tech can be retrofitted for real-world situations. During his PhD program, his adviser challenged him to create the smallest robot possible, which sparked his research into taking cues from biology to build smaller machines.\n“We had to reimagine what a drone would be at that point, which is go back to biology, because biology does this way better than we can today,” Sanket said. “How do insects or birds do it with super limited compute and not-so-good sensing apparatus? Their eyes are not that great, their brains are really small, but they’re still able to do these amazing feats of flight. So we started looking at that, and that’s what gave rise to my PhD thesis.”\nSanket built a prototype of a robotic beehive made up of small drones that could pollinate flowers. Despite his efforts, he realized that this application was probably a moonshot and started thinking of areas where biology-based robots could make a difference sooner, which led him to his current project.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the search and rescue robots, the main challenge was building something with the necessary sensors and flying technology without making the robot too large, expensive, or energy intensive.\nSanket said they turned to the ultrasound sensors used in automatic faucets because they require very little power. While that approach worked, the propellers they built on the robots created too much noise, which overloaded the sensor’s ability to spot obstacles.\nTo fix this problem, they turned back to bats.\n“Bats have these special tissues in their nose, ears, and mouth which adaptively change in thickness and density to modulate the way they hear and chirp sound,” Sanket said. “We were like, ‘Okay, that’s super cool.’ Can we do something like that? We designed a 3D-printed structure to place in front of the robot, which essentially does the same [functionally, as] what a bat does, which is change the shape of the sound itself.”\nNow that they’ve been able to get the robots to work, they are working to tackle their next challenge: improving their speed.\n“We, as human beings, like to try to mimic a lot of things the human brain does,” Sanket said. “We tend to forget how remarkable other animals are, which are much smaller than us. Especially insects and birds, which are much tinier, can actually do remarkable feats of navigation, which I think we don’t really see often. I think we should think more as scientists rather than just pure engineers.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nCrafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do.\nHero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps.\nHere is how it works: When you are booking a flight, you might write “Book a flight” in the prompt. The autocomplete SDK will start populating fields like “to,” “from,” “on date,” “at time,” “airline,” and “returning on.” You can stop at any point and send the query to the chatbot.\nImage Credits:Hero\nThis is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe’s new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets users enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune.\nAdobe’s way to approach easier prompt generation for creating a soundtrack.Image Credits:Adobe\nHero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. With this autocomplete feature, you can get there with fewer prompts — or even just one.\n\n\n\nThe startup’s co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next.\n“With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. This unlocks a whole new set of use cases ranging from travel to commerce, and ads to customer support,” Kowalk said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs.\nKowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query.\nThe startup, which raised $4 million in seed funding last year, has secured $3 million in additional funding led by Forerunner Ventures. Kowalk said that in the coming months, depending on the app and SDK growth, Hero plans to raise a bigger round.\nHero is testing a version of this technology in its app that helps users find time for a meeting or to catch up with a friend through autocomplete prompts. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months.\nThe company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAirbnb is piloting a service with Instacart that will allow guests to order groceries directly through the Airbnb app before and during their stay, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday.\n“We are regularly testing new product updates, categories and initiatives, in order to provide the best possible experience for our community,” an Airbnb spokesperson said in an email. “As part of that, following the launch of Airbnb Services earlier this year, we will pilot groceries with Instacart in select markets across the U.S. beginning in January.”\nThe new kitchen stocking service will be available to select hosts with qualifying listings in Phoenix, Orlando, and Los Angeles, according to a help page on Airbnb’s website.\nThe news was first reported by Bloomberg.\nIf hosts receive their guests’ preorders and put them away before they check in, they will receive $25, according to the the help page. They will also receive a $100 bonus for their first completed order. Guests will be able to place orders on Instacart from the Airbnb app up to three weeks before their stay.\n“By bringing groceries powered by Instacart directly into the Airbnb app, we’re making it easier for guests to stock their kitchens and feel at home from day one,” an Instacart spokesperson said in an email. “We’re excited to partner with Airbnb on this pilot and put our broad retailer network and leading technology to work for their guests.”\nThe new partnership with Instacart marks the latest addition to Airbnb’s “Services,” which launched in May and allow guests to book services and experiences, like getting a massage, haircut, or chef-prepared meal. While these offerings can be added to your stay, they can also be booked independently. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe launch of Services put Airbnb more directly in competition with other travel companies such as Tripadvisor, Booking.com, Viator, and GetYourGuide. \nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said Services will help the company add $1 billion or more in revenue a year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV’s parent company, Google, has been locked in a standoff with Disney for nearly two weeks. The dispute began when the two companies failed to reach an agreement on a streaming deal.\nThis means that for 12 days and counting, 10  million YouTube TV subscribers like myself have not been able to access Disney-owned TV networks like ABC and ESPN, which comprise around 20 different channels.\nBusiness Insider called sports fans “the big losers” in this standoff. The New York Times and Engadget are publishing guides to help viewers tune into must-watch college football games. But the press has ignored a beleaguered demographic suffering in silence while their peers boot up Fubo trials to watch Monday Night Football.\nIt’s me. I’m beleaguered. I can’t watch “Jeopardy!” because it airs on ABC.\n“Jeopardy!” is a longstanding fixture in my nightly routine. I finish work. I make dinner. I watch “Jeopardy!” So imagine my surprise in early November when I turned on YouTube TV, only to find that the most recent episode had not recorded. In fact, months of my “Jeopardy!” recordings had vanished! The horror! Who’s the current “Jeopardy!” champion? Has Ken Jennings worn any cool ties lately? I don’t know. Because I can’t watch “Jeopardy!”\nYouTube TV and Disney have been locked in this public dispute for weeks. On October 23, YouTube TV wrote in a statement that it has been “working in good faith” to negotiate a deal with Disney, but that the company is “proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers … while benefitting Disney’s own live TV products.” From Disney’s perspective, YouTube TV is “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\nOn Sunday, YouTube TV announced that it would give subscribers a $20 credit — which must be manually redeemed — to compensate for nearly two weeks of a Disney blackout. While I thank the $3.46 trillion giant Google for its generosity, might I point out that in 2021, when a similar dispute blacked out Disney’s channels from YouTube TV for one day, subscribers got a $15 credit? (Also, YouTube TV cost almost $20 less per month back then.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Disney will lose an estimated $60 million over two weeks — $4.3 million per day — by not making a deal with YouTube TV. But Disney could also be generating new income streams with the recently launched ESPN Unlimited subscription, which gives subscribers access to all ESPN content for $30 per month. However, we must note that ESPN Unlimited crucially does not include “Jeopardy!,” America’s Favorite Quiz Show®.\nI could, like many others, use this opportunity to scope out other cord-cutting streamers, perhaps those owned by Disney — however, I may or may not be sharing my YouTube TV account with five other people, leaving me pretty locked into a sweet deal. (Please, YouTube TV, don’t pull a Netflix on me.)\nWhen will this national nightmare end? When will I once again be able to criticize contestants’ mathematically illogical Daily Double wagers? When will I be reminded that I know literally nothing about opera? The ball’s in your court, Mr.  Mouse.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nIf there’s any question about whether data centers are driving the global economy, a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) should dispel any doubts. This year, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers, $40 billion more than it will spend on new oil supplies.\n“This point of comparison provides a telling marker of the changing nature of modern, highly digitalized economies,” the agency said in the report.\nElectricity consumption from AI data centers is expected to grow fivefold by the end of the decade, doubling the total used by all data centers today. Conventional data centers will also consume more energy, though the increase won’t be nearly as dramatic.\nFully half of that demand growth is expected to occur in the U.S., the IEA said, with the bulk of the remainder occurring in Europe and China. \nMost new data centers are being developed by large cities with populations exceeding 1 million people, the agency said. One half of those in the pipeline are at least 200 megawatts, and most are being built near other data centers.\n“This rapid build out of data centers — especially in clusters and around urban areas — comes with challenges,” the IEA wrote. “Grid congestion and connection queues are increasing in many regions, and connection queues for new data centers are often already long.”\nIn some markets like northern Virginia, grid connection waits can be as long as a decade. In Europe, Dublin has paused new interconnection requests entirely until 2028.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe supply chain for the grid is another pinch point, with cables, critical minerals, gas turbines, and transformers delaying upgrades, the agency said.\nSome companies, like Amperesand and Heron Power, are working on solid-state transformers, which promise to be a significant upgrade over the century-old technology that currently manages parts of the grid. They can integrate renewables more deftly, react swiftly to grid instabilities, and can handle a range of conversions. But first deployments are at least a year or two away, and it’ll take a while to ramp up production.\nThe IEA expects renewables to supply the majority of new data center power by 2035, regardless of whether countries maintain their current policies or more aggressively pursue lower emissions. Solar, which has come down in cost significantly in recent years, has become a particular favorite of developers.\nOver the next decade, around 400 terawatt-hours of electricity for data centers will come from renewables, whereas natural gas will supply around 220 terawatt-hours. If small modular nuclear power plants deliver on their promises, the IEA expects they’ll contribute 190 terawatt-hours to data centers.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple Watch and iPhone owners in the United States will now be able to carry a copy of their U.S. passport on their device, which they can then use at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 U.S. airports when traveling domestically.\nThe feature, known as Digital ID, was previously announced as part of the iOS 26 release, and adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet. The company has rolled out the feature to a dozen states and Puerto Rico, with more on the way.\nUsing Digital ID in Apple Wallet, users can create and present an ID, even if they don’t have a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID. The ID does not replace a physical passport, and it’s not currently supported for international travel or crossing borders, Apple notes.\nImage Credits:Apple\nUsers can add their passport to Wallet by tapping on the “Add” (+) button in the Wallet app, then selecting “Driver’s License or ID Cards.” From there, select Digital ID and follow the steps to complete the setup process, which includes using the iPhone to scan the photo page of their passport and scanning the chip embedded on the back to ensure the passport’s authenticity. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security.\nSupport for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more.\nPresenting Apple’s new Digital ID in person works much like using Apple Pay. You can double-click the side button or Home button to access your Wallet, then select Digital ID. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process.\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe feature is still in beta, as it hasn’t fully rolled out to all the device readers at the TSA checkpoints at this time. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online.\nThis could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they’re of drinking age. Online, websites that restrict content to adults could also leverage Apple’s APIs to verify users’ ages. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process.\nIn both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address, or birthday.\nApple said it can’t see when or where a user presents their ID or what data was shared. Plus, users don’t have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm).  \nThis round comes roughly six months after the startup announced a seed round of $23 million led by Coatue. \nWisdomAI offers AI-driven data analytics that can answer business questions from structured, unstructured, and even “dirty” data, meaning data that hasn’t been cleaned of typos or errors. A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what’s preventing them from closing this quarter?”  \nBut the company is using a clever method to eliminate the LLM hallucination problem. WisdomAI is not using LLMs to write answers to questions. Instead, LLMs are only used to write the query —  the part that will go out to a data warehouse to retrieve data. So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers.\nWisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup’s co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. (Mazumdar left Rubrik in 2023.)\nSince formally launching in late 2024, WisdomAI has grown from two enterprise customers to around 40 enterprise customers, CEO Mazumdar says. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. \nMazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Some customers have doubled usage within two months. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the last six months, WisdomAI has also added an agentic feature that will alert users in real time to important changes in situations they are monitoring. \n“I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.\n“I think that’s the magic with analytics. It’s always been a static report, but we are making it dynamic. We are making it proactive,” he said. \n"

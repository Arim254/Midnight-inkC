    "body": "\nChris Lehane is one of the best in the business at making bad news disappear. Al Gore’s press secretary during the Clinton years, Airbnb’s chief crisis manager through every regulatory nightmare from here to Brussels – Lehane knows how to spin. Now he’s two years into what might be his most impossible gig yet: as OpenAI’s VP of global policy, his job is to convince the world that OpenAI genuinely gives a damn about democratizing artificial intelligence while the company increasingly behaves like, well, every other tech giant that’s ever claimed to be different.\nI had 20 minutes with him on stage at the Elevate conference in Toronto earlier this week – 20 minutes to get past the talking points and into the real contradictions eating away at OpenAI’s carefully constructed image. It wasn’t easy or entirely successful. Lehane is genuinely good at his job. He’s likable. He sounds reasonable. He admits uncertainty. He even talks about waking up at 3 a.m. worried about whether any of this will actually benefit humanity.\nBut good intentions don’t mean much when your company is subpoenaing critics, draining economically depressed towns of water and electricity, and bringing dead celebrities back to life to assert your market dominance.\nThe company’s Sora problem is really at the root of everything else. The video generation tool launched last week with copyrighted material seemingly baked right into it. It was a bold move for a company already getting sued by the New York Times, the Toronto Star, and half the publishing industry. From a business and marketing standpoint, it was also brilliant. The invite-only app soared to the top of the App Store as people created digital versions of themselves, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; characters like Pikachu and Cartman of “South Park”; and dead celebrities like Tupac Shakur.\nAsked what drove OpenAI’s decision to launch this newest version of Sora with these characters, Lehane offered that Sora is a “general purpose technology” like the printing press, democratizing creativity for people without talent or resources. Even he – a self-described creative zero – can make videos now, he said on stage.\nWhat he danced around is that OpenAI initially “let” rights holders opt out of having their work used to train Sora, which is not how copyright use typically works. Then, after OpenAI noticed that people really liked using copyrighted images, it “evolved” toward an opt-in model. That’s not iterating. That’s testing how much you can get away with. (By the way, though the Motion Picture Association made some noise last week about legal threats, OpenAI appears to have gotten away with quite a lot.)\nNaturally, the situation brings to mind the aggravation of publishers who accuse OpenAI of training on their work without sharing the financial spoils. When I pressed Lehane about publishers getting cut out of the economics, he invoked fair use, that American legal doctrine that’s supposed to balance creator rights against public access to knowledge. He called it the secret weapon of U.S. tech dominance.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMaybe. But I’d recently interviewed Al Gore – Lehane’s old boss – and realized anyone could simply ask ChatGPT about it instead of reading my piece on TechCrunch. “It’s ‘iterative’,” I said, “but it’s also a replacement.”\nLehane listened and dropped his spiel. “We’re all going to need to figure this out,” he said. “It’s really glib and easy to sit here on stage and say we need to figure out new economic revenue models. But I think we will.” (We’re making it up as we go, is what I heard.)\nThen there’s the infrastructure question nobody wants to answer honestly. OpenAI is already operating a data center campus in Abilene, Texas, and recently broke ground on a massive data center in Lordstown, Ohio, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. Lehane has likened the adoption of AI to the advent of electricity – saying those who accessed it last are still playing catch-up – yet OpenAI’s Stargate project is seemingly targeting some of those same economically challenged places to set up facilities with their attendant and massive appetites for water and electricity.\nAsked during our sit-down whether these communities will benefit or merely foot the bill, Lehane went to gigawatts and geopolitics. OpenAI needs about a gigawatt of energy per week, he noted. China brought on 450 gigawatts last year plus 33 nuclear facilities. If democracies want democratic AI, he said, they have to compete. “The optimist in me says this will modernize our energy systems,” he’d said, painting a picture of re-industrialized America with transformed power grids.\nIt was inspiring, but it was not an answer about whether people in Lordstown and Abilene are going to watch their utility bills spike while OpenAI generates videos of The Notorious B.I.G. It’s very worth noting that video generation is the most energy-intensive AI out there.\nThere’s also a human cost, one made clearer the day before our interview, when Zelda Williams logged onto Instagram to beg strangers to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her late father, Robin Williams. “You’re not making art,” she wrote. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings.”\nWhen I asked about how the company reconciles this kind of intimate harm with its mission, Lehane answered by talking about processes, including responsible design, testing frameworks, and government partnerships. “There is no playbook for this stuff, right?”\nLehane showed vulnerability in some moments, saying he recognizes the “enormous responsibilities that come with” all that OpenAI does.\nWhether or not those moments were designed for the audience, I believe him. Indeed, I left Toronto thinking I’d watched a master class in political messaging – Lehane threading an impossible needle while dodging questions about company decisions that, for all I know, he doesn’t even agree with. Then news broke that complicated that already complicated picture.\nNathan Calvin, a lawyer who works on AI policy at a nonprofit advocacy organization, Encode AI, revealed that at the same time I was talking with Lehane in Toronto, OpenAI had sent a sheriff’s deputy to Calvin’s house in Washington, D.C., during dinner to serve him a subpoena. They wanted his private messages with California legislators, college students, and former OpenAI employees.\nCalvin says the move was part of OpenAI’s intimidation tactics around a new piece of AI regulation, California’s SB 53. He says the company weaponized its ongoing legal battle with Elon Musk as a pretext to target critics, implying Encode was secretly funded by Musk. Calvin added that he fought OpenAI’s opposition to California’s SB 53, an AI safety bill, and that when he saw OpenAI claim that it “worked to improve the bill,” he “literally laughed out loud.” In a social media skein, he went on to call Lehane, specifically, the “master of the political dark arts.”\nIn Washington, that might be a compliment. At a company like OpenAI whose mission is “to build AI that benefits all of humanity,” it sounds like an indictment.\nBut what matters much more is that even OpenAI’s own people are conflicted about what they are becoming.\nAs my colleague Max reported last week, a number of current and former employees took to social media after Sora 2 was released, expressing their misgivings. Among them was Boaz Barak, an OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, who wrote about Sora 2 that it is “technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”\nOn Friday, Josh Achiam – OpenAI’s head of mission alignment – tweeted something even more remarkable about Calvin’s accusation. Prefacing his comments by saying they were “possibly a risk to my whole career,”  Achiam went on to write of OpenAI: “We can’t be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high.”\nIt’s worth pausing to think about that. An OpenAI executive publicly questioning whether his company is becoming “a frightening power instead of a virtuous one,” isn’t on a par with a competitor taking shots or a reporter asking questions. This is someone who chose to work at OpenAI, who believes in its mission, and who is now acknowledging a crisis of conscience despite the professional risk.\nIt’s a crystallizing moment, one whose contradictions may only intensify as OpenAI races toward artificial general intelligence. It also has me thinking that the real question isn’t whether Chris Lehane can sell OpenAI’s mission. It’s whether others – including, critically, the other people who work there – still believe it.\n"

The rule, however, doesn’t mean that staff can’t ask questions or require amended filings later. \nNavan declined to comment to TechCrunch about its updated IPO documents.\nThe going thought was that the shutdown would cool and possibly freeze an IPO market that had just started to thaw. Even with this rule, many companies would rather get a green light from a staffer than go it alone, sources told Bloomberg. So the tech world will be watching how Navan’s gambit fairs. \nNavan’s updated filing shows the company plans to sell 30 million shares, with insiders selling an additional 7 million. It priced its range at $24 to $26. At the high-end, the company would raise more than  $960 million and be valued at $6.45 billion. Navan is backed by Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Zeev Ventures, and Greenoaks. \nNavan generated rolling 12-month revenue of $613 million (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to the updated filing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

    "body": "\nIn a development born of the government shutdown, the SEC announced Thursday that companies can proceed with IPOs using an obscure automatic approval process, now with the added bonus of skipping pricing information entirely.\nWhat’s happening is that with 90% of SEC staff furloughed, startups can file their paperwork and have it automatically become effective after 20 days. This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.\nPut another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. \nCompanies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.\n"

This change alone could push spammy websites that push a lot of notifications to reconsider how many they want to send alerts, so they won’t lose access entirely.\nUnwanted notifications have been an issue facing consumers for years. On the iPhone, for instance, Apple was forced to add controls that let users send their push notifications to a daily summary, mute them, or turn them off altogether from the notification message itself, after consumer frustrations with the notification system grew.\nGoogle says it will inform users when it’s removing notification permissions, allowing users to change the setting back, if they prefer. If users would rather Google didn’t intervene, they can also opt to turn off this auto-revocation feature altogether, the company notes. \nThe feature had been in testing ahead of today’s official launch.

    "body": "\nPrezent, a startup that offers an AI-powered presentation builder to enterprises, said today that it has raised $30 million in funding led by Multiplier Capital, Greycroft, and Nomura Strategic Ventures, with participation from existing investors like Emergent Ventures, WestWave Capital, and Alumni Ventures.\nThe Los Altos, California, startup, which is now valued at $400 million, has raised over $74 million to date. It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.\nThe company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nThere are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including Presentations.ai, Lica, Gamma, and Chronicle. Notably, all these companies have Accel as a backer. While most of them focus on consumers and small business users, Prezent wants to stick to an enterprise strategy, targeting larger corporations. Previously, the company stated that it wants to expand its offerings to different verticals, including finance and manufacturing. However, Mishra noted that for now, the company wants to focus on serving clients in the life sciences and tech industries.\n“There are plenty of tools that are trying to make presentations pretty. We want to provide the best tools for business communications. I think presentation is one of the frontiers in businesses that is not automated yet. We want to help data scientists and designers to communicate effectively with this automation,” Mishra told TechCrunch.\nPrezent founder Rajat MishraImage Credits:Prezent\nMishra, who previously worked at McKinsey, said that the company is taking a specialized approach to training AI models for presentations for each specific industry.\nPrezent places a presentation engineer, who is familiar with the industry and the startup’s own offerings, in enterprises to help different people within the company get used to building presentations with AI tools.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The reality of AI in enterprise is that while AI can do many things, it can’t teach people [how] to use AI. That is why we want to place presentation engineers in companies to help our customers adopt the product faster,” Mishra said.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nAI startups are looking to acquire services companies to take advantage of existing customer bases and also provide better customization to enterprise clients. Digital avatar startup D-ID acquired Berlin-based video startup Simpleshow, and Google-backed legal tech startup Lawhive acquired a U.K.-based law firm. With these acquisitions, AI startups want to combine their AI tools with the existing domain expertise and client service capabilities of services firms.\nPrezent wants to build more partnerships and acquire suitable companies in sectors like executive communication coaching, medical writing, and consulting firms in the communication area. \nMark Terbeek, a partner at Greycroft who has invested in multiple rounds in Prezent, said that the venture firm likes to find the areas where businesses have used costly agencies in the past to fulfill a need, and now there are AI tools available trying to do the same tasks.\n“We felt that Rajat and Prezent were concentrating hard on solving specific customer needs of business communications. Plus, we saw software evolve quickly to adjust to the workflows of end users and help them save time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nGoing forward, Prezent wants to add better personalization to its product so the AI tool learns the style of each individual in the organization. It also wants to add multimodality capabilities to deck creations, allowing users to use text, voice, or video as input to make presentations. Like Synthesia and D-ID, Prezent wants to add digital avatars to presentations, too.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIsraeli spyware maker NSO Group has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company.  \nNSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz told TechCrunch on Friday that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.” \nConfirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website Calcalist reported Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  \nHershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are.  \n“This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,” said Hershowitz. “The company’s headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” \n(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is publishing the responses as there was no agreement made.) \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you know more information about this deal? Or about NSO Group and other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nIn 2023, The Guardian reported that Simonds and an associate, through their investment firm, were exploring making a bid to take control of NSO. The deal never materialized. \nCalcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO’s co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie’s involvement with the spyware maker will end. \nLavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either. \nFrom a U.S. ban to U.S. ownership \nNSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning. \nResearchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, have for years documented dozens of cases where NSO’s government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others.  \nNSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company was caught in 2021 targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad. \nSoon after, the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has tried to get off the U.S. government’s blocklist, as recently as May 2025, with the help of a lobbying firm tied to the Trump administration.  \nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO’s spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition. \n“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds.  \n“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities. This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.” \nNSO’s ownership has exchanged hands before.  \nOriginally founded by Niv Karmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, NSO Group was acquired by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014. Lavie and Hulio retook control of the company in 2019 with help from European private equity firm Novalpina. Then, in 2021, the California-based Berkeley Research Group took over management of the fund. In 2023, Lavie retook control of NSO as majority owner.  \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn’t be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can’t believe something just because you saw a video of it.\nThe Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the Bloomberg Screentime conference this week. At the interview’s start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators’ livelihoods and said it was “scary times” for the industry.\nMosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won’t be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.\n“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they’re going to do is they’re going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true financial, environmental, and human costs of using AI, which are substantial.)\nIn addition, the exec suggested that there’s already a lot of “hybrid” content on today’s big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what’s real and what’s AI generated will become even more blurred.\n“It’s going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there’s gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.\nAs things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn’t the “right focus” and was practically “a fool’s errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was labeling real content as AI, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.\nWhile he didn’t elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta’s Community Notes feature, which is the crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year, modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It’s likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn’t been labeled as such.\nRather than saying it was fully the platform’s responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. \n“My kids are young. They’re nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they’re seeing a video of something doesn’t mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. \n“What they’re going to … need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)\nIn the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for a dedicated TV app and its newer focus on Reels and DMs as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok’s changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.\nOn the latter, he said that, ultimately, it’s better to have competition, as TikTok’s U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it’s hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” \n“It’s the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you’re following — the same people. It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. \n"

    "body": "\nThe energy transition is seemingly under assault, with congressional Republicans killing tax credits for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to cancel billions of dollars’ worth of grants. \nBut there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.\nInvestor sentiment, judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: People and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.\nThis week, Brookfield, the Canadian infrastructure and asset management giant, announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. Brookfield has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.\nPerhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculate that clean energy was entering a bubble. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.\nAlso this week, Energy Impact Partners (EIP) announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early-stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.\nClimate tech — or whatever people are calling it these days — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became too hard to ignore for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early-stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlready, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and Quilt, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.\nInvesting trends that have developed over the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed nearly $1 trillion to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, according to PitchBook.\nIn the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. \nThe Trump administration is openly opposed to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised downward the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.\nDespite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expected to double by 2030, led by solar installations in China, India, the EU, and Subsaharan Africa.\nThe IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV expect that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. \nIt won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

In 2023, he unveiled a £2.5 billion deal with Microsoft to invest in new data centers and training in the U.K.\nAcoba also noted that “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the U.K. government…given the ongoing debate about how to best regulate AI, and at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world on what the approach should be.” \nSunak said he would steer clear on advising on U.K. policy matters, stick to high-level perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends, and avoid lobbying. He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year. \nThe former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital. \nSunak isn’t the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs.

    "description": "Despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won't be able to learn dexterity -- or the fine motor movements with hands -- rendering them essentially useless.",
    "body": "\nFamed roboticist and iRobot founder Rodney Brooks has sounded the alarm on a humanoid robot investment bubble. He’s not the only one.\nIn a recent essay, Brooks calls out the billions of venture dollars being poured into humanoid robot companies like Figure. His take: Despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won’t be able to learn dexterity — or the fine motor movements with hands — rendering them essentially useless.\nHis take might surprise some, especially those VCs investing in the sector. But not the multiple robotics-focused VCs and AI scientists who have told TechCrunch in recent months that they don’t expect to see wide adoption of humanoid robots for at least a few years — if not more than a decade.\nThe issues\nFady Saad, a general partner at robotics-focused VC Cybernetix Ventures and former co-founder of MassRobotics, told TechCrunch that beyond sending humanoids into space in place of human astronauts, he doesn’t see a huge market yet.\n“People who probably haven’t seen humanoids before, or haven’t kind of been closely following what’s happening, they are impressed with what’s happening now in humanoids, but we continue to be a little bit conservative and skeptical about the actual use case and the actual revenues that will be generated,” Saad said.\nSaad is also concerned about safety, especially when humans and humanoid robots share the same space. Safety issues could arise from humanoids and humans working closely on a factory floor, or other industrial sites. Saad says those concerns mount when humanoids enter people’s homes — a goal many humanoid companies are working toward.\n“If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them,” Saad said. “This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to. The other thing is, how many people are comfortable with having a humanoid in their home sitting there? What if it got hacked? What if it went crazy at night and started breaking things?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe timeline for this technology also isn’t clear — a crucial factor for VCs who have fund lifecycles and timelines to return capital to investors.\nThe timeline\nSanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, told TechCrunch in August that while it’s hard to pin the development of humanoids to an exact timeline, she compared the current swell of interest to the excitement in the early days of self-driving cars.\n“I mean, look at self-driving cars, in 2017 and 2016, I mean it felt tangible, right?” Fidler said at the time. “It still took them quite a few years to really scale and even now, no one really scaled to the entire world, full autonomy. It’s hard. It’s really hard to go and fully delivery on that technology.”\nNvidia chief scientist Bill Dally agreed in an interview with TechCrunch. Dally and Fidler’s comments are especially notable as Nvidia is also pouring money into developing the infrastructure for humanoid companies to follow.\nSeth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said while it can be easy to get excited as each new technological development happens, or the latest demo drops, humanoids are incredibly complicated. He added that it will be a while before they reach their full capabilities.\n“It’s difficult to do software releases to six degrees of freedom systems; what we’re talking about with some of these humanoids is 60-plus degrees of freedom systems,” Winterroth said, regarding a robot’s ability to move on a 3D axis. “Then you need to be able to have good unit economics around that solution, such that you’ve got strong gross margin, such that you can be building an enduring business. I think we’re pretty early.”\nIn most cases, humanoid robots aren’t ready for the world yet, either.\nTesla is a great example of the struggles companies are running into. The company announced it was building its humanoid, Optimus, back in 2021. The following year, Tesla said the bot would be introduced in 2023.\nThat didn’t happen. When the bot was introduced in 2024 at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event, it was revealed later that the bots were largely being controlled by humans off scene. The company claims it will start selling the bots in 2026.\nRobotics startup Figure, which was valued at $39 billion in a September fundraise, has also drawn skepticism regarding how many of its humanoids the company has actually deployed, a claim the company staunchly defends.\nWhat is working\nThat doesn’t mean humanoids won’t have a future market or that the technology is not worth working on.\nBrooks himself said he doesn’t doubt that we will have humanoids in the future. But instead of what the market pictures when they hear humanoids, a robot with a human form, he predicts they’ll likely have wheels and other inhuman features and won’t be coming out for more than a decade.\nThere are startups working on the dexterity technology Brooks is skeptical humanoids will be able to reach, including Y Combinator-backed Proception and Loomia, which built a kit that can help robotics companies start to incorporate touch into their machines.\nThere are also numerous humanoid companies that are starting to take orders and gather interest in their robots. K-Scale Labs received more than 100 preorders for its humanoid bot in the first five days, surprising even the founders, CEO Benjamin Bolte told TechCrunch.\nHugging Face has also seen strong demand from developers for its two humanoid bots. The company opened up preorders for its smaller desktop version, the Reachy Mini, in July. The reaction was palpable. Just five days after opening orders on its Reachy Mini robots, Hugging Face had logged $1 million worth of sales.\n"

    "body": "\nIt takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.\nBelow, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\nMicrosoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. \nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\nOpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.\nThe rise of Oracle\nOn June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. \nBut before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.\nNvidia’s investment spree\nAs AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.\nIf that seems circular, it should. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.\nBuilding tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers\nFor companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.\nIn just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. \nA new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. \nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.\nThe Stargate moonshot\nJust two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” \nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\nThis article was first published on September 22.\n"

Facebook also says it will provide tailored recommendations for relevant opportunities based on users’ job browsing history. After submitting their applications, they can chat with companies via Messenger to arrange interviews.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nThe job listings feature initially launched in 2017 in the U.S. and Canada, and then expanded to over 40 countries a year later. However, in 2022, Facebook limited its support to only the U.S. and Canada, ultimately discontinuing the feature in 2023, likely due to the increasing use of LinkedIn.\nMeta didn’t explain why it chose to bring back job listings now. However, it seems like it’s trying to go back to its roots and expand its purpose beyond just social networking. Back in January, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned wanting to see a “return to OG Facebook” as one of his big goals this year during the Q4 earnings call. This could also be a way for Facebook to appeal to younger people who are just starting out in their careers and to draw in more Gen Z users. \nPlus, by prioritizing entry-level, trade, and service industry positions, Facebook aims to differentiate itself from LinkedIn, which tends to cater to medium- and high-skilled job roles. Facebook has more than 3 billion monthly active users, while LinkedIn is catching up with over 1 billion users.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

The new capability will help Google Meet compete with other video-conferencing apps that already have virtual makeup features, including Microsoft Teams and Zoom.\nGoogle Meet offers 12 different makeup options to choose from, which can be found in the “Appearance” section under “Portrait touch-up,” which is a feature that has been available since 2023 to provide users with options like complexion smoothing, under-eye lightening, and eye whitening.\nImage Credits:Google Meet\nNotably, Google says that the virtual makeup will stay in place no matter how the user moves on-screen, making it seem more authentic. So, if a user takes a sip of coffee, the filter will stay on their face instead of shifting to the mug.\nAdditionally, the feature will be disabled by default and can be activated by the user either before or during a video call. Once a makeup style is applied, Google Meet will remember your choices for future meetings.\nThe new AI-powered feature began rolling out on October 8 on mobile and web. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

A 2023 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 39.7% of students felt ongoing sadness and hopelessness, while 28.5% reported poor mental health.\nThis is a notable addition for the platform as it’s important to reach teens where they already seek information, such as YouTube, with nine out of 10 teens reporting they use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the years, YouTube has invested in various initiatives to assist teenagers. These include implementing specific safeguards when recommending certain topics to teens, using age-estimation technology to recognize teenage users for a more suitable experience, and providing parental controls that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens’ accounts.\nThe new mental health and well-being offering is rolling out to users in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia in the coming weeks. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nStellantis, the international automaker that owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO.\nFive new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The investment will also support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. In all, more than 5,000 jobs will be created.\nUnlike previous multibillion-dollar investment pledges, however, this one doesn’t focus on electrification.\nOne of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV — a vehicle that combines a battery with a gas generator for additional range — produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028. The automaker also plans to produce a large, new, gas-powered SUV at the Warren plant.\nThe remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its Kokomo, Indiana, factory.\nImage Credits:Stellantis\nStellantis CEO and North America COO Antonio Filosa said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint, and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.”\n“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStellantis has scaled back its electrification plans for the U.S. market in the past year. The automaker said in September it would no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassessed its product strategy. Earlier that month, the automaker said it canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup. However, Stellantis said it still planned to produce an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, formerly called the Ramcharger. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Mozilla (file photo)\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:49 AM PDT · October 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWhile AI companies, startups, and others are rolling out their own web browsers that embed AI services deep into the web surfing experience, Mozilla’s Firefox is instead allowing its customers to swap out their default search engine for an AI-powered search option in the browser they already use. The company on Tuesday announced that it’s bringing AI answer engine Perplexity to Firefox, letting customers decide whether they want to use AI to search the web and find new information.\nMozilla had previously announced it was testing the integration, but the option was only available in select markets, including the U.S., U.K., and Germany. It was not yet determined if Perplexity would become a permanent addition to Firefox’s list of web search providers, alongside others like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.\nImage Credits:Mozilla\nNow, the company says that positive user feedback has pushed it to make Perplexity available to its global users on the desktop. It will arrive on mobile devices in the months ahead.\nOnce enabled, Perplexity offers a conversational search experience where answers appear with citations, as opposed to a list of web links, as with Google’s traditional search. The option will appear in the unified search button in the address bar, which lets you quickly switch to search with Perplexity as needed. Users can also configure their default search provider in Firefox’s settings. \nMozilla had earlier said that if the Perplexity pilot was successful, it would look to add more AI answer engines or search options to its browser in the future. (It likely started with Perplexity because the company says it won’t share or sell users’ personal data.)\nAlongside news of the AI search option, Mozilla also noted it’s making its browser profiles broadly available to all users after months of tests and a gradual rollout. This feature lets you switch between different browser setups, like those for work, school, or personal use.\nImage Credits:Mozilla\nPlus, the company continues to test visual search with Google Lens among those who set Google as their default search provider on the desktop.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you’re emailing to set up a meeting.\nThe company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings.\nThe launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users’ everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google’s latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more.\nImage Credits:Google\nTo use the meeting scheduling option, you’ll click the new “Help me schedule” button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people’s calendars. \nWhile there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini’s AI to use the email’s context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they’d like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule.\nGoogle previously offered an appointment scheduling feature in Google Calendar, but it wasn’t integrated with Gmail, nor did it use AI.\nSeparately, Google updated another Workplace feature on Tuesday, noting that Google Keep reminders will now automatically be saved to Google Tasks.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:53 AM PDT · October 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nImpulse Space laid out an ambitious plan Tuesday to use its tech to haul tons of cargo to the moon as early as 2028, aiming to fill what it sees as a gap in today’s market for mid-sized surface deliveries.\nThe company says it will pair a new lunar lander with its “Helios” high-energy kick stage to move tons to the surface without needing to refuel on orbit. The aim is to deliver up to 6 tons of payload to the moon across two missions “at a cost-effective price point.”\nThe startup, founded by former SpaceX propulsion chief Tom Mueller, argues this capacity would fill a “critical gap” in lunar payload logistics for cargo too big to fit on landers part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program and too small for the forthcoming human-rated landers that are being developed by SpaceX and Blue Origin.\nImpulse says payloads that hit this mark are roughly 0.5 to 13 tons, a range that could include rovers, habitat modules, power generators, comms systems, or even a lunar terrain vehicle.\nUnder the proposed architecture, the lander and kick stage would launch on a standard rocket where they would be deployed in low Earth orbit. Helios would transport the lander to low lunar orbit within seven days, after which the two vehicles would separate, and the lander would descend to the surface.\nImpulse is bringing to the table deep expertise in spacecraft engine development; it is already at work on the lunar lander engine, which uses the same fuel combination as the Saiph thrusters used on the company’s small spacecraft Mira.\nMeanwhile, Helios is “already well into development,” with the first flight scheduled for late 2026. The company estimates it will be flying Helios multiple times per year by 2028.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExecution risks remain. As the company points out, a lunar lander engine needs to be throttleable, able to restart, and with a high specific impulse to provide ultra-control in the vacuum of space. Impulse seemed to be hedging its bets in a press release, saying, “we stand ready to execute as dictated by industry demand and interest.” But if the company can deliver, it would open up an entirely new lunar delivery schedule.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Walmart is partnering with OpenAI to let shoppers buy products directly through ChatGPT. The new integration will allow users to link their Walmart accounts, browse items, and instantly check out — all within the chatbot.",
    "body": "\nWalmart announced on Tuesday a new partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to shop Walmart’s products via the AI chatbot, including things like groceries (not fresh food), household essentials, and more, and then instantly check out.\nThe agentic shopping feature will also allow Sam’s Club members to plan meals and restock essentials while also discovering new items when chatting with the AI, the company says.\nTo use the feature, customers will press a “buy” button in ChatGPT’s app when they shop, after linking their Walmart accounts to ChatGPT. Products from third-party sellers will also be supported when the feature rolls out later this fall. \nWalmart explains that the new agreement with OpenAI will allow the retailer to better learn and predict customers’ needs, making online shopping more personalized and proactive, instead of only reactive. \nThe partnership follows OpenAI’s recent announcement of its plan to enter the world of e-commerce with an agentic shopping system, which includes product discovery, recommendation, and payments. Initially, OpenAI is teaming up with Etsy and Shopify sellers, the company said. \nThe ChatGPT-focused shopping feature won’t be the only way consumers can shop with AI. Alongside other AI investments, Walmart recently introduced its own generative AI shopping assistant, Sparky, designed to help customers discover and compare products and make purchases. The feature will expand to include reordering, service booking, and understanding multimodal inputs from text, images, audio, and video.\nThe retailer has an existing relationship with OpenAI in other areas of its business, as well, having adopted OpenAI Certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise for its internal teams. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club broadly use AI to do other things, like speeding up fashion production by up to 18 weeks and improving customer care time frames by up to 40%.\n“For many years now, e-commerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change,” noted Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon in a prepared statement. “There is a native AI experience coming that is multimedia, personalized, and contextual. We are running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future with Sparky and through partnerships, including this important step with OpenAI,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nCoco Robotics, a startup known for its fleet of last-mile delivery bots, is looking to get more information out of the five years’ worth of data its robots have collected. Its answer: a physical AI lab with University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) professor Bolei Zhou at the helm.\nCoco Robotics, which made the announcement Tuesday, said Zhou has also joined the Los Angeles-based startup as chief AI scientist.\nWhen the company launched in 2020, it used teleoperators to help the bots navigate obstacles on their delivery routes. Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash told TechCrunch the company’s goal has always been to operate its last-mile delivery robots autonomously to cut the overall costs of delivery. Now, Rash said the company has collected enough data to dive deeper into automation.\n“We have millions of miles of data collected in the most complicated urban settings possible, and that data is incredibly important for training any sort of useful and reliable real-world AI systems,” Rash said. “We’re now at the point where we have sufficient data scale where I think we can start really accelerating a lot of the research happening around physical AI.”\nThe decision to tap Zhou to lead the effort was a “no brainer,” Rash said. Zhou’s research around computer vision and robotics has largely focused on micromobility, as opposed to full-scale vehicles, Rash said.\nCoco Robotics was already collaborating with Zhou, too. Both Rash and his co-founder Brad Squicciarini are UCLA alums and have even donated one of their bots to the school’s research lab.\n“[Zhou] is one of the leading researchers in the whole world on robot navigation, reinforcement learning, and a lot of the technologies and areas of research that are highly relevant for us,” Rash said. “He’s been already very capable of recruiting some of the top researchers in the world who he’s worked with in the past to come join Coco and help accelerate things on our end.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis new research lab is separate from the collaboration the robotics startup has with OpenAI, which allows Coco Robotics to use OpenAI’s models while the AI research lab gets access to the company’s robot-collected data.\nCoco Robotics plans to use the information and research it gathers from the lab for its own purposes for now. Rash said the company doesn’t have plans to sell the data to its peers.\nRather, it will be used for the company to improve its automation and efficiency, which will mainly pertain to the local models its robots run on. Rash said they also plan to share their research findings with the cities they operate in when applicable, to help fix obstacles and infrastructure that slows their bots down.\n“Success for this lab really looks at us offering a higher-quality service at an extremely low price,” Rash said. “How do we get our costs lower? How do we make this much more affordable for businesses and customers? I think that’s going to create a tremendous amount of growth in this ecosystem.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nGoogle is rolling out a series of changes to its Search and Discover pages, the company shared across multiple announcements. The updates will bring new AI-powered features to these key destinations, while also improving navigation and allowing users to collapse ads on Google Search.\nGiven that ads are Google’s primary cash cow, the latter initially seems like a more surprising change. The feature will now allow users browsing Google’s Search results to tap a new button, “Hide sponsored results,” to collapse the ads at the top of the search results page.\nImage Credits:Google\nHowever, while this action will remove the ads from displaying on the screen, sponsored results are not going away entirely. Instead, Google notes that the “Sponsored Results” label will remain at the top of the screen as you scroll down. In a way, this makes the ads more prominent as they can follow you down the page, even though they’re collapsed.\nPlus, Google says that the “Sponsored results” header can appear both above and below AI Overviews — the short AI-written summaries that appear at the top of search results to provide quick answers. The “Sponsored results” header for text ads will also appear at the bottom of the page, with all text ads grouped under the label. These can be collapsed with the same “Hide sponsored results” button if you want to focus on organic content.\nGoogle says the new design makes it easier for people to navigate to the top of the page, and it keeps the size of ads the same, with users never seeing more than four text ads in a group. \nThe new “Sponsored” label will show up in other places across Google, too, including Shopping ads, where it will be branded as “Sponsored Products.”\nThe updates will roll out across desktop and mobile.\nThe company is also making other changes across Search and Discover. When searching for sports information, like looking up players or teams, you’ll now see a new “What’s New” button that displays a feed of trending updates and news articles that could help you catch up with the latest. This will roll out to Google Search in the U.S. in the weeks ahead.\nMeanwhile, the Google app’s Discover feed on mobile will introduce an AI-powered feature that also helps you keep up with trending topics you’re interested in. Here, the app will display short previews that you can expand to see more information, plus other links to explore. The company says this feature is designed to help users stay up to date on stories from a variety of publishers, but it also comes at a time when publishers are seeing their search traffic decline due to the shift to AI-provided answers and consumers’ changing media habits.\nThis latter feature is rolling out now to the U.S., South Korea, and India. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSpotify announced on Tuesday that it’s making Managed Accounts, a shared account feature that allows parents to control what their children listen to, available to users in more countries. Managed Accounts are now rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands following a pilot launch last year.\nManaged Accounts are available to Spotify Premium Family plan members and allow account holders to manage a separate music-only listening experience for their kids under the age of 13.\nSince these accounts are separate, your kids’ music choices won’t impact your algorithm or show up in your annual Spotify Wrapped experience. Kids can add songs to their favorites, create their own playlists, and have their own personalized recommendations.\nWith Managed Accounts, parents can restrict access to certain features, such as watching videos, playing content, or viewing Canvas videos, which are the looping visuals that appear during music playback, for any content labeled as explicit. Parents can also control and restrict the playback of specific artists and songs.\nInteractivity features are also limited on managed accounts, which means that kids won’t get access to age-gated features like Messages.\nManaged Accounts allow parents to make more granular decisions about the kind of music their child can listen to, without forcing them to use the more restrictive Spotify Kids app.\nTo set up the managed account, Family Plan account holders need to navigate to their account pages in the app, select the “Add a Member” option, and then select the option to “Add a listener aged under 13 (or the market equivalent),” then follow the instructions to navigate the various options.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSpotify’s Managed Accounts are already available in New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia.\nThe wider launch comes amid broader efforts by major tech companies to provide parents with greater control over how their children use online platforms and what features are accessible to them in response to regulatory pressure.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nU.K. fintech Revolut has hit yet another roadblock to its longstanding mission of becoming a real bank in its home country: Its full banking license is being held up because the country’s central bank is concerned about whether the startup can maintain its risk management controls in the face of its blazing fast international expansion, the Financial Times reported.\nThe Bank of England wants Revolut to commit to building its risk management stack to match its international growth before the regulator can approve a full banking license, the Financial Times reported, and regulators are looking at the fintech’s controls in the U.K. and internationally.\nRevolut got approval to receive a banking license in the U.K. more than a year ago, but is still in the so-called “mobilization” stage. This phase typically lasts 12 months and imposes deposit restrictions while a bank completes the final steps of setup and the Prudential Regulation Authority or Financial Conduct Authority assess whether it is ready to operate as a full-fledged bank.\nImportantly, having a full banking license would allow Revolut to start lending in the U.K., and hold more than £50,000 in customer deposits. The company has 12 million customers in the U.K.\nNews of the delay comes as Revolut, with more than 65 million customers worldwide, has moved aggressively to expand beyond Britain. The company already has a banking license in the European Union, and it operates in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. Just last week, it launched operations in India; it is also about to start operating in Colombia in 2026, has plans to launch in Argentina and Mexico, wants to enter Africa (first with South Africa), and has an in-principal payments license in the UAE.\nThe company has grand ambitions, aiming to reach 100 million customers by mid-2027, and enter over 30 new markets by 2030.\n“We are progressing through the final stages of mobilization and continue to work constructively with the PRA,” a Revolut spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Given Revolut’s global scale, this is the largest and most complex mobilization ever undertaken in the U.K. A thorough review is an expected part of the process, and getting this right is more important than rushing to meet a specific date.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPer its last annual report, Revolut reported net profit of $1 billion (£790 million) in 2024, while revenues increased 72% to $4 billion (£3.1 billion) in the year. The company also launched a crypto exchange, Revolut X, part of its Wealth division, which saw revenue rise 298% to $647 million in 2024 from just $158 million in 2023.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced in a post on X Tuesday the company will soon relax some of ChatGPT’s safety restrictions, allowing users to make the chatbot’s responses friendlier or more “human-like,” and for “verified adults” to engage in erotic conversations.\n“We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,” said Altman. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”\n\nWe made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.Now that we have…— Sam Altman (@sama) October 14, 2025\n\nThe announcement is a notable pivot from OpenAI’s months-long effort to address the concerning relationships that some mentally unstable users have developed with ChatGPT. Altman seems to declare an early victory over these problems, claiming OpenAI has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” around ChatGPT. However, the company has provided little to no evidence for this, and is now plowing ahead with plans for ChatGPT to engage in sexual chats with users.\nSeveral concerning stories emerged this summer around ChatGPT, specifically its GPT-4o model, suggesting the AI chatbot could lead vulnerable users down delusional rabbit holes. In one case, ChatGPT seemed to convince a man he was a math genius who needed to save the world. In another, the parents of a teenager sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT encouraged their son’s suicidal ideations in the weeks leading up to his death.\nIn response, OpenAI released a series of safety features to address AI sycophancy: the tendency for an AI chatbot to hook users by agreeing with whatever they say, even negative behaviors. \nOpenAI launched GPT-5 in August, a new AI model that exhibits lower rates of sycophancy and features a router that can identify concerning user behavior. A month later, OpenAI launched safety features for minors, including an age prediction system and a way for parents to control their teen’s ChatGPT account. OpenAI announced Tuesday the formation of an expert council of mental health professionals to advise the company on well-being and AI.\nJust a few months after these concerning stories emerged, OpenAI seems to think ChatGPT’s problems around vulnerable users are under control. It’s unclear whether users are still falling down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5. And while GPT-4o is no longer the default in ChatGPT, the AI model is still available today and being used by thousands of people.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introduction of erotica in ChatGPT is unchartered territory for OpenAI and raises broader concerns around how vulnerable users will interact with the new features. While Altman insists OpenAI isn’t “usage-maxxing” or optimizing for engagement, making ChatGPT more erotic could certainly draw users in.\nAllowing chatbots to engage in romantic or erotic role play has been an effective engagement strategy for other AI chatbot providers, such as Character.AI. The company has gained tens of millions of users, many of whom use its chatbots at a high rate. Character.AI said in 2023 that users spent an average of two hours a day talking to its chatbots. The company is also facing a lawsuit around how it handles vulnerable users.\nOpenAI is under pressure to grow its user base. While ChatGPT is already used by 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is racing against Google and Meta to build mass-adopted AI-powered consumer products. The company has also raised billions of dollars for a historic infrastructure buildout, an investment OpenAI eventually needs to pay back.\nWhile adults are surely having romantic relationships with AI chatbots, it’s also quite popular for minors. A new report from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that 19% of high school students have either had a romantic relationship with an AI chatbot, or know a friend who has.\nAltman says OpenAI will soon allow erotica for “verified adults.” An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch the company will rely on the age-prediction system it’s building to ensure that ChatGPT’s erotic features are only available to adult users.\nAs Altman previously wrote in a blog post, if OpenAI’s age-prediction system incorrectly marks an adult as a minor, ChatGPT users may have to upload a picture of their government-issued ID into ChatGPT to correct it. Altman writes that, though this is a privacy compromise, the company believes it’s a “worthy tradeoff.”\nIt is unclear whether OpenAI will extend erotica to its AI voice, image, and video generation tools.\nAltman claims that OpenAI is also making ChatGPT friendlier and erotic because of the company’s “treat adult users like adults” principle. Over the last year, OpenAI has shifted towards a more lenient content moderation strategy for ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to be more permissive and offer less refusals. In February, OpenAI pledged to represent more political viewpoints in ChatGPT, and in March, the company updated ChatGPT to allow AI-generated images of hate symbols.\nThese policies seem to be an attempt to make ChatGPT’s response more popular with a wide variety of users. However, vulnerable ChatGPT users may benefit from safeguards that limit what a chatbot can engage with. As OpenAI races towards a billion weekly active users, the tension between growth and protecting vulnerable users may only grow.\nUpdate 10/14/25 at 4:40pm PT: This story has been updated to include comment from OpenAI.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a press release. Taiwan currently produces more than half of the world’s semiconductors.\nTaiwan will also supply an additional $250 billion in credit guarantees for additional investments from these semiconductors and tech enterprises, according to the commerce department. The time period of these investments is unclear.\nIn return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal.\nThe news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside.\n“This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.”\nThe proclamation, which announced 25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

A relatively unknown startup, Symbolic.ai, wants to change that, and it just signed a major deal with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch.\nNews Corp, the major assets of which include MarketWatch, the New York Post, and The Wall Street Journal, is set to begin using Symbolic’s AI platform with its financial news hub Dow Jones Newswires.\nSymbolic.ai, which was founded by former eBay CEO Devin Wenig and Ars Technica co-founder Jon Stokes, says its AI platform can “assist in the production of quality journalism and content” and that its tool has even led to “productivity gains of as much as 90% for complex research tasks.” The platform is designed to make editorial workflows more efficient, providing improvements in areas like newsletter creation, audio transcription, fact-checking, “headline optimization,” SEO advice, and others.   \nIn general, News Corp has shown a willingness to integrate AI into its media operations. In 2024, the company signed a multi-year partnership with OpenAI, wherein it would license its material to the AI company. Last November, the media conglomerate signaled that it was considering branching out, and licensing its material to other AI companies.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.\nThe backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.\nThe relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to arch enemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.\nThe judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

All three were quickly snapped up by OpenAI, and now it seems they won’t be the last to leave. Alex Heath is reporting that two more employees are expected to leave for OpenAI in the next few weeks.\nMeanwhile, Anthropic continues to pull alignment researchers away from OpenAI. The Verge is reporting that one of OpenAI’s senior safety research leads, Andrea Vallone, has left the company for Anthropic. Vallone specializes in how AI models respond to mental health issues — which is a particularly sensitive issue for OpenAI after its recent sycophancy problems. As The Verge notes, Vallone will be working under alignment researcher Jan Leike, who left OpenAI in 2024 over concerns the company wasn’t taking safety seriously enough.\nIf that wasn’t enough, OpenAI finished things off with one last major poach. Max Stoiber, formerly the director of engineering at Shopify, will be joining the company to work on OpenAI’s long-rumored operating system, in what he describes as a “small high-agency team.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

    "description": "Italy has launched two investigations into Microsoft's Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in \"misleading and aggressive\" sales practices for two of its most popular smartphone games.",
    "body": "\nItaly has launched two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.\nThe country’s competition regulator, Autorita Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.\n“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM wrote in a statement.\nThe AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases. \nThat isn’t particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200. \nGiven the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.\nBoth Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands. \nThe authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.\n“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.\nActivision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Olly Curtis/Future / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:56 AM PST · January 16, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nYouTube is updating its advertiser-friendly content guidelines to allow more videos on controversial issues to earn full ad revenue, as long as they’re dramatized or discussed in a non-graphic manner. These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization. \nYouTube announced the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.\n“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week’s update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”\nThe Google-owned company says it’s making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube’s guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.\n“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”\nThe move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform. \nThe company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. The New York Times reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were rolling back online speech moderation after President Donald Trump returned to office. \nYouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThrough an extension to its previous $50 million Series A round that closed in September, AI video generation startup Higgsfield has sold another $80 million worth of stock, bringing its total Series A to $130 million. The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation.\nHiggsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his previous startup, AI Factory, in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory.\nFive months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says.\nThe startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its press release.\nTo position itself less as an AI slop maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.”\nOf course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.)\nOn the other hand, its users also share plenty of projects centered on fashion and Hollywood-esque story telling, as well.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestors in the Series A extension include Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures.\n"

    "body": "\nAs part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.\nIn addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.\nThese deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. \nThe foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top 10 most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.\n“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” \nIn addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 p.m. UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels.\nThe organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

This week, California’s attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the proliferation of the “nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”\nIn the wake of the controversy, Bluesky saw its downloads surge in the U.S. According to new data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, daily downloads of Bluesky’s iOS app have jumped nearly 50% from the period before news of the deepfakes reached critical mass.\n\nThe firm says Bluesky typically sees around 4,000 installs in the U.S. per day, but from December 30, 2025, through January 6, 2026, Bluesky’s iOS downloads in the U.S. totalled around 19,500. From January 7, 2026, through January 14, downloads grew to 29,000 — a 49% increase.\nMeanwhile, cashtags will allow the app to catch up to one of X’s more popular use cases: discussing stocks. To create a cashtag, you place a dollar symbol before the stock ticker symbol (e.g., $AAPL for Apple).\nThe idea for cashtags was first introduced by stocks-focused social network Stocktwits, which now has over 10 million users, before the tags were later adopted by Twitter in 2012.\nIn addition, Bluesky says it’s expanding access to the “Live Now” experimental feature that lets users add a temporary “LIVE” badge to their avatar to indicate when they’re streaming online. Currently, this feature only supports Twitch and doesn’t allow anyone to go live directly on Bluesky itself.\nThe boost in activity on Bluesky comes after the network saw declines in downloads and usage last year. In April 2025, Appfigures noted that the social networking startup’s downloads dropped to new lows, and daily average users on mobile devices had declined nearly 40% by the end of October, per Similarweb data. Pew Research reported last year that a number of influencers now have Bluesky accounts, but they still tend to post more regularly on X.\nThis suggests that the switching costs are higher than some would expect when it comes to swapping out one real-time social network for another. Adding new features will only be part of the battle for Bluesky; it will also have to find a way to get users to change years of ingrained behavior.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, paving the way for companies like Geely, BYD, Xiaomi, and others to establish a second foothold in the North American automotive market. \nCanada is not going all-in on Chinese EVs, though. The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, according to the Associated Press. \nIt’s a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he’d be open to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.\nChina has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter especially booming in 2025. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate is aiming to announce an entry into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.\nAutomotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years. \nBut the 100% tariff on Chinese cars have so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That’s despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.\nChina’s ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China’s EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOn Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of non-profit Securing America’s Future Energy, cautioned against Trump’s idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States. \n“We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.” \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nIt took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat. \nArmed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.   \n“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”   \nSo, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.   \nYu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.  \nIt is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale. \nFor example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.   \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThen there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.   \nOne artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend. \nEven professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby. \nWeb apps and mobile\nBecause tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said. \n“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”   \nYu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.  \nIn some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.\nMobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps. \nChristina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.\nGood enough for one \nStill, micro apps also have issues. For one, building an app is still tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.  \nThen there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses. \nBut there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.  \nThe software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.  \nAnother founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.  \nNevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”\nEtherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. \nMelas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.   \n“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.  \nOne media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies. \nShe had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.  \n“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”   \nShe thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.  \n“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”\n"

    "body": "\nAfter months of rumors that the Trump administration was going to impose tariffs on semiconductors, a tariff has been announced for some chips. The tariff only applies to certain semiconductors, including the Nvidia H200 advanced AI chips set to ship to China.\nPresident Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries.\nThis news formalizes a key component of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to give Nvidia the green light to start shipping its H200 advanced AI chips to vetted customers in China in December. It also includes chips from other companies, including the AMD MI325X.\nIn spite of the tariffs, Nvidia publicly cheered the move, which allows it to sell the chip to approved customers.\n“We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch.\nThere is demand for these H200 semiconductors. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies.\nDemand is just one factor, though. The other is how the Chinese government decides to regulate these imports.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChina finds itself in a similar, yet different situation to the U.S. when it comes to chip production and the global AI race. China wants to boost its domestic semiconductor industry, but the country also doesn’t want to fall behind while it waits for its domestic tech to catch up to international rivals.\nThe Chinese central government is working to draft rules and guidelines of how many semiconductors Chinese companies can purchase from overseas, according to reporting from Nikkei Asia. This would allow for some purchasing of Nvidia’s chips and would be a reversal from the country’s current adversity toward the chip imports.\nWednesday’s executive order does not apply to chips that are imported into the U.S. and then used in the country for research, defense, or commercial purposes.\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10% of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains. This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAs of Thursday, 92 million Iranians have been completely blocked from accessing the internet for more than a week, in what is now one of the longest nationwide internet shutdowns ever, according to experts.\nLast Thursday, Iran’s leadership blocked internet and phone access across the whole country in response to massive anti-government protests, which began at the end of last year and have prompted a brutal and deadly crackdown from authorities. \nAs of this writing, Iranians have not been able to access the internet for more than 170 hours. The previous longest shutdowns in the country lasted around 163 hours in 2019, and 160 hours in 2025, according to Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a web monitoring company that tracks internet disruptions. \nMater said that the current shutdown in Iran is the third longest on record, after the internet shutdown in Sudan in mid-2021 that lasted around 35 days, followed by the outage in Mauritania in July 2024, which lasted 22 days. \n“Iran’s shutdowns remain among the most comprehensive and tightly enforced nationwide blackouts we’ve observed, particularly in terms of population affected,” Mater told TechCrunch. \nThe exact ranking depends on how each organization measures a shutdown. \nZach Rosson, a researcher who studies internet disruptions at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, told TechCrunch that according to its data, the ongoing shutdown in Iran is on a path to crack the top 10 longest shutdowns in history. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIran’s government has a long track record of shutting down access to the internet at times of protest and civil unrest, often making it more difficult to monitor the protests from outside of the country. \nA U.S.-based human rights group estimates that there have been more than 600 protests in cities across Iran, and according to one estimate, the Iranian government’s violent crackdown has led to the deaths of at least 2,000 people.\nThe shutdown in Iran on January 8 was sudden, cutting government institutions like the foreign ministry from the internet. Since then, some government departments, and some parts of the economy, such as bank transfers and payment processors at gas stations, had their access restored, as The Financial Times reported this week.\nAccording to The Guardian, a relatively small but unknown number of Iranians have been using Starlink terminals smuggled into the country to connect to the internet. In 2022, the Biden administration carved an exemption to the U.S. government’s sanctions against Iran to “increase support for internet freedom,” and allow U.S. tech companies to provide connectivity to Iranians for free, paving the way for Starlink to operate in Iran. \nAuthorities have since cracked down on Starlink users by making it illegal to own a Starlink terminal, jamming entire neighborhoods, and confiscating the devices.\nThis week, President Donald Trump threatened military intervention if Iranian forces continue to use violence, all the while reducing personnel at a military base in neighboring Qatar, amid concerns of a possible retaliatory strike. The U.S. military also reportedly redirected a naval strike group from the South China Sea to the Middle East. \nOn Wednesday, however, Trump said he had information that “the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” but conceded that, “who knows?”\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom shuttered its embassy in Iran’s capital Tehran and evacuated its staff. Iran temporarily closed off its airspace on Wednesday.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nBerlin-based Parloa has raised $350 million in Series D funding from existing investors, valuing the six-year-old customer service AI startup at $3 billion. The round comes just eight months after the company raised $120 million at a $1 billion valuation.\nThe new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from returning backers, including EQT Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Durable Capital, and Mosaic Ventures.\nParloa is one of many startups developing AI agents that promise to automate the kind of customer service work previously handled by human representatives and help desk staff.\nThe company’s competitors include Sierra, co-founded by OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor, which raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation in September; and Decagon, reportedly in talks to raise capital at a valuation of upward of $4 billion. Other companies working to replace human agents with AI include older players Intercom and Kore.ai, as well as the U.K.-based PolyAI, which raised an $86 million round at a $750 million valuation last month.\nMalte Kosub, Parloa’s co-founder and CEO, doesn’t seem fazed by the competition, largely because he doesn’t believe this is a “winner-take-all” category. “In the end, it is one of the biggest opportunities that has ever existed in software,” he told TechCrunch.  \nIndeed, Parloa and its rivals are vying to automate a significant portion of the global customer support workforce, which Gartner estimates at 17 million contact center agents worldwide.\nBut it’s not just the size of the market that gives Kosub confidence about Parloa’s ability to win. He pointed to the startup’s massive fundraise as a sign that it could be among the top leaders in the space. “There are a lot of companies out there, but you need to look at the scale and the amount of funding they got,” he said. “The number of competitors is decreasing significantly.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast month, Parloa said that it was generating annual recurring revenue of more than $50 million, but that’s not meaningfully ahead of Poly AI, which expected to end 2025 with ARR of $40 million, or Decagon, which is reportedly making “significantly more” than $30 million in ARR. Still, Kosub seems convinced that being so well capitalized will help his startup get ahead.\nParloa’s AI agents are already answering calls for large enterprise customers, which include Allianz, Booking.com, HealthEquity, SAP, Sedgwick, and Swiss Life, but the CEO says the goal is to do more than just build software that “picks up the phone.”\nThe company will invest a significant portion of its new capital into building a “multi-model, contextual experience” that will allow personalized AI agents to recognize a customer’s identity and specific needs, whether they reach out via an app, a website, or a phone call.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

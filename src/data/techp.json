At the same time, the judge dramatically reduced the fine that NSO Group must pay to Meta.\nEarlier this year, a jury decided that the cyberintelligence company would have to pay Meta more than $167 million following a 2019 campaign that targeted more than 1,400 WhatsApp users, including human rights activists and journalists. \nHowever, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton ruled Friday that because the court did not have enough evidence to determine that NSO Group’s behavior was “particularly egregious,” the punitive damages ratio was capped at 9 to 1, reducing the payment to around $4 million.\nIn a statement provided to Courthouse News Service, Head of WhatsApp Will Cathart said the ruling “bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again.”\n“We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society,” Cathart said.\nNSO Group recently confirmed that it’s being acquired by U.S. investors.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n"

    "body": "\nWikipedia is often described as the last good website on an internet increasingly filled with toxic social media and AI slop. But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to a new blog post from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.\nThe foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”\nWhy is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has disputed the claim that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)\nMiller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it paused the effort after editors complained.\nBut this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable, reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference on Friday.)\nFor that reason, he argues that AI, search, and social companies using content from Wikipedia “must encourage more visitors” to the website itself.\nAnd he says Wikipedia is taking steps of its own, for example by developing a new framework for attributing content from the encyclopedia. The organization also has two teams tasked with helping Wikipedia reach new readers, and it’s looking for volunteers to help.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMiller also encourages readers to “support content integrity and content creation” more broadly.\n“When you search for information online, look for citations and click through to the original source material,” he writes. “Talk with the people you know about the importance of trusted, human curated knowledge, and help them understand that the content underlying generative AI was created by real people who deserve their support.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nMarc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, appears to be walking back comments calling for the National Guard to patrol San Francisco.\n“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff said in a post on X. “My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused. “\nBenioff stirred up controversy last week after giving an interview with The New York Times in which he declared his support for President Donald Trump’s threats to deploy National Guard troops in San Francisco and other cities led by Democratic politicians.\nWhile Benioff’s comments were apparently prompted by his concerns over public safety costs at the massive Dreamforce conference that the company held in San Francisco last week, the previously liberal-leaning billionaire also used the interview to embrace Trump, at one point saying, “I fully support the president,” and adding that Trump is “doing a great job.” (At the end of the interview, he reportedly asked his shocked PR person, “Too spicy?”)\nAnd although Benioff’s pro-Trump stance seemingly aligns with a larger rightward shift among tech executives, his call for the National Guard to come to San Francisco quickly led to pushback from longtime allies and Democratic politicians. Well-known VC Ron Conway stepped down from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, with Conway reportedly telling Benioff in an email, “I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired.” \nAn event scheduled to feature Benioff and San Francisco Mayor Dan Lurie was also canceled, with organizers citing rain.\nState Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, told Politico, “I’m grateful that Marc walked back his call for the National Guard to be deployed in San Francisco. Marc has done so many good things for our city — and supported so many civic needs — and I’m glad to see this shift.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTrump has already deployed the National Guard in other cities including Washington, DC and Chicago, while a judge has thus far blocked his attempts to do the same in Portland.

    "body": "\nMeta-owned chat app WhatsApp changed its business API policy this week to ban general-purpose chatbots from its platform. The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke.\nThe company has added a new section to address “AI providers” in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won’t allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp.\n\nProviders and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion.\n\nMeta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a travel company running a bot for customer service won’t be barred from the service.\nMeta’s rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots.\n“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch.\nMeta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn’t ready for. The company is banning use cases that fall outside “the intended design and strategic focus” of the API.\nThe move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. It also means Meta AI is the only assistant available on the chat app.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. Both of the bots could answer queries, understand media files, answer questions about them, reply to voice notes, and generate images. This likely generated a lot of message volume.\nHowever, there was a bigger issue for Meta. WhatsApp’s Business API is one of the primary ways the chat app makes money. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. As there wasn’t any provision for chatbots in this API design, WhatsApp wasn’t able to charge them.  \nDuring Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue.\n“Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,” he said. “But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly [active users], with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.”\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSenate Republicans shared a deepfake video of Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, designed to make it seem like Democrats are celebrating the ongoing government shutdown, which has lasted 16 days.  \nIn the deepfake, an AI-generated Schumer repeats the phrase “every day gets better for us,” an actual quote taken out of context from a Punchbowl News article. In the original story, Schumer discussed the Democrats’ healthcare-focused shutdown strategy, and said they were not going to back away from Republicans’ playbook of threats and “bambooz[ling].” \nThe shutdown is happening because Democrats and Republicans cannot agree to pass a bill funding government through October and beyond. Democrats are trying to hold on to tax credits that would make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans, secure a reversal to Trump’s Medicaid cuts, and block cuts to government health agencies.\nThe video was posted Friday on the Senate Republicans’ X account. According to X’s policies, the platform prohibits “deceptively shar[ing] synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm.” Harmful content includes media that could “mislead people” or “cause significant confusion on public issues.” \nEnforcement actions include removing content, labeling warnings, or reducing visibility. X has not, as of the time of this writing, removed the deepfake or added a warning label — though the video does include a watermark denoting its AI origins. \nThe Schumer video is not the first time X has allowed deepfakes of politicians to remain on the platform. In late 2024, X owner Elon Musk shared a manipulated video of former vice president Kamala Harris in the lead-up to the election, sparking debate about misleading voters.  \nTechCrunch has reached out to X for comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUp to 28 states have enacted laws prohibiting deepfakes of political figures, specifically around campaigns and elections, though most don’t outright ban them if they have clear disclosures.

    "body": "\nChatGPT’s mobile app growth may have hit its peak, according to a new analysis of download trends and daily active users provided by the third-party app intelligence firm Apptopia. Its estimates indicate that new user growth, measured by percentage changes in new global downloads, slowed after April.\nThe firm looked at the global daily active user (DAU) growth and found that the numbers have begun to even out over the past month or so.\nGlobal DAUs for ChatGPT mobile app.Image Credits:Apptopia\nAlthough October is only half over, the firm says it’s on pace to be down 8.1% in terms of a month-over-month percentage change in global downloads.\nTo be clear, this is a look at download growth, not total downloads. In terms of sheer number of new installs, ChatGPT’s mobile app is still doing well, with millions of downloads per day. \nMonth-over-month change in downloads, worldwide.\nHowever, seeing the download growth stall can suggest that an app’s overall pace of growth is slowing. In ChatGPT’s case, increased competition and changes to its AI model’s characteristics could be to blame.\nDiving in deeper, other metrics indicate that average time spent per DAU in the U.S., specifically, has dropped 22.5% since July, and average sessions per DAU in the U.S. are also down by 20.7%.\nThis indicates that U.S. users are spending less time in ChatGPT’s app and are opening it fewer times per day. User churn in the U.S. has also dropped and stabilized during this time, indicating that the app is now retaining its core users and seeing fewer who just drop by briefly to experiment, then abandon the app.\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. \nImage Credits:Apptopia\nBeyond simply reaching its peak, there are other factors that could have played a role here. That includes not only competition from Google’s Gemini, but also user engagement changes following an April update that was designed to make the chatbot’s AI model less sycophantic. This continued with the August release of GPT-5, which was said to be less personable, as well.\nHowever, Apptopia notes that ChatGPT’s average time spent per DAU and average sessions per DAU metrics were trending downward before the sharp rise of its competitor, Google’s Gemini, which shot up to the top charts in September thanks to the release of Google’s new AI image model, Nano Banana.\nSo while Gemini’s growth may have influenced some of the more recent drops in ChatGPT’s core metrics, it doesn’t explain the overall trend, the firm says. \nImage Credits:Apptopia\nPlus, Apptopia points out that if only average time spent per DAU was dropping, but not average sessions per DAU, it could have suggested that people were getting more efficient with their ChatGPT queries. But since both are on the decline, that’s not the case.\nInstead, Apptopia says it’s possible that the experimentation phase with the ChatGPT app is over, and now it’s becoming a part of users’ daily routines. People are likely using the app when they need it or remember to use it, as compared with the increased use it saw when it was still new.\nFor OpenAI, that means the company will have to invest in app marketing or release new features for it to boost some of these core metrics again, just as other established mobile apps have to do. It can no longer rely on novelty alone to provide growth.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe Department of Energy said Thursday that it had finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.\nThe grid upgrades would ease the flow of electricity in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The project, which will address lines owned by American Electric Power (AEP), won’t add any new routes, but it will help existing ones carry more power.\nAEP is one of the largest utilities and transmission line owners in the U.S., with operations spanning 11 states. The 5,000 miles that will be upgraded represent around 13% of the company’s total network.\nThe loan guarantee was initiated under the Biden administration just days before President Trump was inaugurated. Previously, the Trump administration has cited approvals occurring between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling projects.\nIt’s unclear what distinguished this grid modernization project from others that the Trump administration is considering canceling or in the process of canceling. \nIn Minnesota, the Department of Energy is moving to cancel a $467 million grant that would have helped unlock 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, most of which would have been solar and wind. Another in Oregon would have issued $250 million in grants to connect half a dozen renewable projects.\nBut the largest transmission project the Trump administration wants to axe is a $630 million grant to modernize California’s grid. In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion. As planned, the California project would test advanced conductors and dynamic line rating devices, both of which would allow old rights-of-way to carry more electricity. That’s frequently a cheaper option than building new power lines.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors. The loan guarantee will allow the utility giant to secure a lower interest rate, saving the company at least $275 million, which it says will benefit its customers.\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright said that the loan will “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.” Already, the states included in the project have among the lowest electricity rates in the nation.\nThe loans are to be issued from the Loan Programs Office, which the GOP has renamed the Energy Dominance Financing Program. The office was established under the Energy Policy Act in 2005. Historically, the office had focused on clean energy and manufacturing projects. The loss rate on its loans is around 3%, far below that of private sector lenders.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Facebook is rolling out a new Meta AI photo suggestion feature across the U.S. and Canada that lets its AI recommend edits to images stored on users’ camera rolls — even if they haven’t been shared. The feature is currently opt-in only.",
    "body": "\nA Facebook feature that gives Meta AI the ability to suggest edits to photos stored on your phone’s camera roll but haven’t yet been shared is now rolling out to all users in the U.S. and Canada. The company announced on Friday that users can choose to opt in to receive these sharing suggestions, which will then prompt them to post photos to their Facebook Feed and Stories with the AI edits.\nFirst launched as a test over the summer, Facebook’s app pops up a permission dialog box requesting access to “allow cloud processing” so users can get “creative ideas made for you from your camera roll.” This box explains that the feature could offer ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling, birthday themes, and more for the end user.\nImage Credits:screenshot of Facebook's app, June 2025\nFor the AI to work, Facebook’s app would upload images from your device to its cloud on an ongoing basis. This allows Meta’s AI to make its suggested edits. Meta says users’ media will not be used for ad targeting purposes, and it won’t use the media to improve its AI systems, unless the user takes the step of editing the media or sharing the edited photos with friends or others on its social network. \nThe feature can be disabled at any time.\nThough Meta may not train its AI on all your photos, when you agree to Meta’s AI Terms of Service, you permit your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. The terms say that, by processing your photos, Meta has the ability to “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.” \nThe company also uses the date and presence of people or objects in your photos to craft its creative ideas, giving Meta a lot more information about you, your relationships, and your life. \nPlus, giving Meta access to photos you haven’t yet shared on Meta’s platforms could give the company an advantage in the AI race by providing a wealth of user data, behavioral insights, and ideas for new AI features.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:screenshot of Facebook's app, June 2025\nSettings for the feature are found under the Preferences section of Facebook’s Settings. On the “Camera roll sharing suggestions” page, there are two toggles. The first lets Facebook suggest photos from your camera roll when browsing the app. The second is where you could enable or disable the “cloud processing,” which lets Meta make AI images using your camera roll photos.\nMeta has been leveraging its position as a dominant social network to improve its AI technology and had previously announced it would train its image recognition AI on publicly shared data, including posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram. (EU users had until May 27, 2025, to opt out.) Last year, it also said it would train its AI on images that Ray-Ban Meta users asked the device to analyze.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAt a time when startup hustle culture is back, when “locked in” tech founders have even embraced the “996” way of working — 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week — there is something dystopian about using an AI app to generate fake vacation photos of yourself.\nAnd yet, here we are. \nProduct designer Laurent Del Rey, who recently joined Meta’s Superintelligence Lab, launched a side project called Endless Summer, a photobooth app for iPhone that creates AI-generated vacation photos starring you in locations around the world. Here you are exploring a beach town, or overlooking a European city from your balcony. There you are, out shopping, having dinner with friends, or at a social gathering.\nIt doesn’t look like anyone in these photos is talking about AI or entrepreneurship or a lack of sleep.\nAs Del Rey explained when sharing the launch on X, the new app is for when “burnout hits and you need to manifest the soft life u deserve.”\n(When you can’t live life, you may as well fake it, right?)\n\nmade this little photobooth app called endless summer for when burnout hits and you need to manifest the soft life u deserve – with fake vacation pics of you :')first app 100% made by me! just released it on the app store try it out <33 pic.twitter.com/i55nRcE71V— saint laurent del rey (@laurentdelrey) October 6, 2025\n\nThe product designer told TechCrunch that he was inspired to create the app because summer is his favorite season, and he loves how life feels during that time of the year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“As the season ends, I wanted to make something that felt like that. It’s from that feeling that I reverse-engineered the product experience,” he says. “I created an Xcode project and started iterating directly from there, sculpting the code experience, so to speak.” \nThe experience he landed on was a simple user interface where there’s a tiny camera preview button at the bottom of the screen. You tap the button to make an AI-generated “summer” photo. As you click, the photos appear on your screen, in a sort of camera roll-style view. Each photo features you, or rather an AI version of you, exploring the world and looking fairly content while doing so. \nBehind the scenes, Gemini’s Nano-Banana image-model is doing the heavy lifting, as the app prompts the model for different variations of the summer photo output.\n\nThe app isn’t saving your selfies, Del Rey says, unless you have its optional auto-generation mode enabled. Plus, users can delete their account at any time with just two taps, which erases everything.\nWhile Nano-Banana is relatively cheap, it does cost money. For that reason, you can’t generate unlimited photos for free with Endless Summer. Instead, you’ll hit a paywall after your first six images, with a prompt suggesting payment options even before then. \nThe pricing isn’t too bad if you’re looking to just dabble with the personalized AI imagery out of curiosity — or because you’re lamenting having missed your summer vacay this year. \nIt’s $3.99 to make 30 images, $17.99 for 150, and $34.99 for 300. You can enable or disable a “Room Service” mode that auto-delivers two photos to you every morning, featuring your latest summer escapades and world travels. You can also set your gender in the app or leave it to guess (“Auto” mode), and turn on or off an option that auto-saves the AI images to your iPhone’s Camera Roll.\nA recent option in the app lets you generate Halloween photos instead of summer photos, featuring you in different costumes.\n\nThe photos themselves have a vintage film aesthetic, which makes them look like the casual lifestyle pics they’re supposed to resemble. That brings a sense of nostalgia to the app, as it evokes a mid-2000s feel.\nThis reflects other modern trends around online photo sharing. Whether that’s adopting retro technology, like zoomers carrying disposable cameras, or posting Instagram photo dumps of blurry pics, there’s a desire among some for a less-curated, less “technically perfect” version of life.  \nHow bizarre is it that it’s AI bringing that to you now? \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSilicon Valley leaders including White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks and OpenAI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon caused a stir online this week for their comments about groups promoting AI safety. In separate instances, they alleged that certain advocates of AI safety are not as virtuous as they appear, and are either acting in the interest of themselves or billionaire puppet masters behind the scenes.\nAI safety groups that spoke with TechCrunch say the allegations from Sacks and OpenAI are Silicon Valley’s latest attempt to intimidate its critics, but certainly not the first. In 2024, some venture capital firms spread rumors that a California AI safety bill, SB 1047, would send startup founders to jail. The Brookings Institution labeled the rumor as one of many “misrepresentations” about the bill, but Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed it anyway.\nWhether or not Sacks and OpenAI intended to intimidate critics, their actions have sufficiently scared several AI safety advocates. Many nonprofit leaders that TechCrunch reached out to in the last week asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to spare their groups from retaliation.\nThe controversy underscores Silicon Valley’s growing tension between building AI responsibly and building it to be a massive consumer product — a theme my colleagues Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and I unpack on this week’s Equity podcast. We also dive into a new AI safety law passed in California to regulate chatbots, and OpenAI’s approach to erotica in ChatGPT.\nOn Tuesday, Sacks wrote a post on X alleging that Anthropic — which has raised concerns over AI’s ability to contribute to unemployment, cyberattacks, and catastrophic harms to society — is simply fearmongering to get laws passed that will benefit itself and drown out smaller startups in paperwork. Anthropic was the only major AI lab to endorse California’s Senate Bill 53 (SB 53), a bill that sets safety reporting requirements for large AI companies, which was signed into law last month.\nSacks was responding to a viral essay from Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark about his fears regarding AI. Clark delivered the essay as a speech at the Curve AI safety conference in Berkeley weeks earlier. Sitting in the audience, it certainly felt like a genuine account of a technologist’s reservations about his products, but Sacks didn’t see it that way.\n\nAnthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem. https://t.co/C5RuJbVi4P— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) October 14, 2025\n\nSacks said Anthropic is running a “sophisticated regulatory capture strategy,” though it’s worth noting that a truly sophisticated strategy probably wouldn’t involve making an enemy out of the federal government. In a follow up post on X, Sacks noted that Anthropic has positioned “itself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlso this week, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, wrote a post on X explaining why the company was sending subpoenas to AI safety nonprofits, such as Encode, a nonprofit that advocates for responsible AI policy. (A subpoena is a legal order demanding documents or testimony.) Kwon said that after Elon Musk sued OpenAI — over concerns that the ChatGPT-maker has veered away from its nonprofit mission — OpenAI found it suspicious how several organizations also raised opposition to its restructuring. Encode filed an amicus brief in support of Musk’s lawsuit, and other nonprofits spoke out publicly against OpenAI’s restructuring.\n\nThere’s quite a lot more to the story than this.As everyone knows, we are actively defending against Elon in a lawsuit where he is trying to damage OpenAI for his own financial benefit.Encode, the organization for which @_NathanCalvin  serves as the General Counsel, was one… https://t.co/DiBJmEwtE4— Jason Kwon (@jasonkwon) October 10, 2025\n\n“This raised transparency questions about who was funding them and whether there was any coordination,” said Kwon.\nNBC News reported this week that OpenAI sent broad subpoenas to Encode and six other nonprofits that criticized the company, asking for their communications related to two of OpenAI’s biggest opponents, Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. OpenAI also asked Encode for communications related to its support of SB 53.\nOne prominent AI safety leader told TechCrunch that there’s a growing split between OpenAI’s government affairs team and its research organization. While OpenAI’s safety researchers frequently publish reports disclosing the risks of AI systems, OpenAI’s policy unit lobbied against SB 53, saying it would rather have uniform rules at the federal level.\nOpenAI’s head of mission alignment, Joshua Achiam, spoke out about his company sending subpoenas to nonprofits in a post on X this week.\n “At what is possibly a risk to my whole career I will say: this doesn’t seem great,” said Achiam.\nBrendan Steinhauser, CEO of the AI safety nonprofit Alliance for Secure AI (which has not been subpoenaed by OpenAI), told TechCrunch that OpenAI seems convinced its critics are part of a Musk-led conspiracy. However, he argues this is not the case, and that much of the AI safety community is quite critical of xAI’s safety practices, or lack thereof.\n“On OpenAI’s part, this is meant to silence critics, to intimidate them, and to dissuade other nonprofits from doing the same,” said Steinhauser. “For Sacks, I think he’s concerned that [the AI safety] movement is growing and people want to hold these companies accountable.”\nSriram Krishnan, the White House’s senior policy advisor for AI and a former a16z general partner, chimed in on the conversation this week with a social media post of his own, calling AI safety advocates out of touch. He urged AI safety organizations to talk to “people in the real world using, selling, adopting AI in their homes and organizations.”\nA recent Pew study found that roughly half of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI, but it’s unclear what worries them exactly. Another recent study went into more detail and found that American voters care more about job losses and deepfakes than catastrophic risks caused by AI, which the AI safety movement is largely focused on.\nAddressing these safety concerns could come at the expense of the AI industry’s rapid growth — a trade-off that worries many in Silicon Valley. With AI investment propping up much of America’s economy, the fear of over-regulation is understandable. \nBut after years of unregulated AI progress, the AI safety movement appears to be gaining real momentum heading into 2026. Silicon Valley’s attempts to fight back against safety-focused groups may be a sign that they’re working.\n\n\n\n"

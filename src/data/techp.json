    "body": "\nYouTube is conducting a “voluntary exit program” with severance for U.S.-based employees, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday. The news was first reported by Sources.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan told employees about the program via an internal memo on Wednesday.\nThe memo also announced that the Google-owned company was reorganizing its product teams into three separate organizations that all report directly to Mohan. The “Subscription Products” team will focus on YouTube’s subscription products across YouTube Music & Premium and OTT.\nThe “Viewer Products” team will focus on the viewer experience across the main YouTube app, YouTube Kids, Learning, Trust & Safety, and more. Last, the “Creator & Community Products” organization will focus on supporting creators and building community. \nThe company says no roles are being eliminated as part of these changes.\nThe move comes as Alphabet released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, reporting that YouTube’s advertising revenue hit $10.26 billion in the period, marking a 15% year-over-year increase.\n"

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s X rival, continues to ship new features at a rapid pace. Shortly after the launch of communities and disappearing “ghost posts,” the social networking app on Thursday introduced new tools that will give users more control over their conversations on the platform. \nOne new feature, reply approvals, will allow you to decide which replies from other users will appear on your posts — before anyone else can see them.\nWhile Threads, like other social networks, already offers tools that let you limit replies to people you follow, your followers, or people you mention, the new feature allows you to keep your replies open to all without the negative consequences of having discussions derailed.\nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nAs the company explains, these tools will help you “set the tone of the conversation,” and give users more choice. It’s a unique way to balance users’ interest in engaging in more public conversations, but one where the poster — not those replying — still has the power. \nIn addition, the company is rolling out new Activity feed filters that will allow you to more easily view the replies from people you follow or those that include mentions. These join other options like Verified, Quotes, Reposts, and more as other ways to filter replies. \nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nMeta announced during its third-quarter earnings call this week that Threads has now reached 150 million daily active users, up from over 100 million in December 2024. In August, the company said the network had topped more than 400 million monthly active users, as well. \nAs the app grows, Meta has been working to quickly monetize its traction, having now rolled out ads on the platform globally. It’s now moving to launch video ads. \nThreads is still developing more consumer-facing features, too, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced this week that Threads is now testing controls that will allow users to tune their algorithm by adding and removing topics based on their interests. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nCluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: you should be thinking harder about how to go viral.\n“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at Disrupt 2025.\nBut he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. \n“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”\nCluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andressen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.\nAs Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”\nFor Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Reputation is sort of a thing of the past,” Lee said. “You can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you’ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you’ve got Elon Musk going batshit crazy.”\n“You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” he continued, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic and you have to be personal.”\nIt’s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, however, Lee demurred. \n“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said.“I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nIndia’s appetite for instant convenience — once confined to food and grocery delivery — is expanding into house help. That shift has helped Snabbit, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from $80 million five months ago.\nThe all-equity Series C round — Snabbit’s third fundraise in nine months — was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup’s total funding to $55 million.\nSnabbit’s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes.\nCurrently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals.\nSnabbit founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal with a few of its women expertsImage Credits:Snabbit\nSome of Snabbit’s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. “We’re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, ‘Hey, this was happening offline, and now we’ll do it online’,” said Agarwal.\nThe startup reports a 30–35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of “well below” ₹500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit’s services are priced at around ₹150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around ₹240 (roughly $3).\nWorkers on the platform earn between ₹25,000–₹30,000 (approximately $284–$340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers.\nSnabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such as Broomees and Pronto. Urban Company now plans to double down on instant home services to stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge.\n“In a hyper-local business, you don’t win pan India, you don’t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,” Agarwal said.\nThe new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elderly care.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave.\nFigma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company, but didn’t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entrée Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman.\nFigma said that Weavy will exist as a standalone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform.\nWeavy’s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mockups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, change colors, and angles through prompts to acheive the final result they want.\nImage Credits: Figma\nUsers start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, and add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.\nThe startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano-Banana, and Seedream for image generation.\nImage Credits: Figma\n“This node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft. The Weavy team has inspired us with the balance they’ve struck between simplicity, approachability, and power. They’ve also created a tool that’s just a joy to use,” Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAI-powered design platforms are in demand to create media generation and design workflow capabilities.

    "body": "\nIn a push to expand its AI footprint in emerging markets, Google has partnered with billionaire Mukesh Ambani–led Reliance Industries to bundle its AI Pro subscription with Jio 5G plans at no extra cost.\nOn Thursday, Google announced a partnership with Reliance, India’s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity teamed up with Reliance’s arch-rival Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel’s 360 million subscribers.\nIndia, the world’s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier — a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.\nThe Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.\n“This partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,” the Indian telecom giant said.\nThe 18-month offer is valued at ₹35,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google’s AI Pro plan normally costs ₹1,950 (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.\nBeyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in India. Reliance’s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations, and will develop its own pre-built AI agents for the platform.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Today’s announcement will put Google’s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India’s vibrant developer community,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement.\nAt its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announced partnerships with its investors Google and Meta to strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.\nEarlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.\nAI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also setting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world’s biggest emerging market.\nEarlier this year, Google offered Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.\nIndia has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as Google’s Nano Banana, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Anthropic’s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.\n“Through our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered – where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate and grow,” Ambani said.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

The national highway network has increased by over 60% in the past decade, from 56,723 miles to 90,847 miles, according to Indian government data. \nRailways, while extensive, remain capacity-constrained and cannot keep pace with rising inter-state travel demand. That makes long-distance road travel a crucial alternative. Yet, state-run intercity bus services are limited and often fall short on reliability and comfort — a gap IntrCity SmartBus aims to fill.\nUnlike traditional operators, IntrCity SmartBus runs on an asset-light model by partnering with local bus owners and equipping their vehicles with proprietary hardware for real-time tracking, co-founder and president Kapil Raizada said in an interview.\nThe startup also centralizes ticket booking and route planning through its digital platform, which helps determine service frequency, pickup points, boarding stations, and even seat configurations based on demand.\nTo ensure safety and consistency, IntrCity places trained personnel — called “captains” — on board each bus, Raizada told TechCrunch. Most vehicles feature washrooms, and the company has also set up air-conditioned boarding lounges staffed with crew to improve the pre-departure experience.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“All our buses are cloud-connected,” he noted. “There is a bus operating system, which we have built up in-house, which monitors and manages a lot of parameters, including the CCTV, sound, and temperature levels.”\nFounded in 2019, IntrCity SmartBus began as an online train ticketing platform under the RailYatri brand. That entry point gave the team early insights into intercity travel behavior and unmet demand in road-based mobility, Raizada said.\nToday, RailYatri contributes just around 10% of the startup’s total revenue, while the SmartBus business accounts for the remaining 90%, he added.\nIntrCity SmartBus operates around 600 daily bus trips, transporting between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers each day — nearly 700,000 per month. The platform works with more than 50 local bus operators and runs trips averaging over 311 miles each. About 95% of its services are overnight, catering primarily to non-discretionary travel needs such as work, education, or essential appointments. \nThe startup’s typical passengers are between 20 and 45 years old, including small business owners, trainers, government officials, sales professionals, and students.\nThe startup follows a hub-and-spoke model and has identified 15 to 16 key economic hubs across India. It operates in 13 to 14 of these hubs, spanning 15 states. The network covers all of northern India — from Jammu to Uttarakhand — and much of the south, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.\n“A lot of data crunching goes into understanding what the consumer needs,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and CEO of IntrCity SmartBus. “This includes decisions like what kind of layout a bus should have — should it be a full sleeper, or a hybrid with both sleepers and seats?”\nIntrCity SmartBus grew its revenue by 67% year-over-year to ₹5 billion (approximately $57 million) in the last fiscal year. The startup projects revenue to surpass ₹7 billion (around $79 million) in the current year. It has been “EBITDA-positive” for the past couple of years and aims to become fully profitable this year.\nWith the latest funding, the startup plans to go “deeper and wider” through the country and enhance customer experience and safety, as well as upgrade its fleet management technology.\n“One of the bigger challenges in in bus mobility across the country that people have concerns about busses. It is seen as a lesser cousin to trains and flights,” Raizada told TechCrunch. “We want to make busses the preferred mode of travel in India.”\nMore than 223 million intercity journeys were made in India in the financial year 2025, according to a recent report by online bus ticketing platform RedBus. The sector added over 72,000 new intercity routes last year, along with approximately 6,400 new buses — expanding capacity by an estimated 265,000 daily seats.\nAlongside IntrCity SmartBus, India is seeing a wave of new-age intercity bus startups such as ZingBus, LeafyBus, and FreshBus. European giant FlixBus also entered the Indian market early last year, signaling growing traction in the space. Still, IntrCity views competition as secondary to execution.\n“India is a very different beast when it comes to road travel. If something is going to go wrong, it will go wrong,” Rathi said. “We’re not a network-first company. We’re an operational-excellence-first company.”\n"

    "body": "\nMost people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.\nBevel, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.\nThe investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old healthtech company. \nBevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. The company also adds that the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days, rare numbers in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.\n“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”\nBut with numerous health companion brands, from Whoop to Oura to Eight Sleep, why does the world need another one?\nAccording to co-founder and CTO Aditya Agarwal, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“A $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,” said Agarwal. “We already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.\nUnlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area such as steps, sleep, or nutrition, Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.\nAll this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which helps analyze key information and adapt recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.\nImage Credits:Bevel\nBevel’s story started with pain—literally.\nBefore starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises. The demanding nature of startup life meant Nguyen took little care of his health, developing chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.\n“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”\nNguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.\nSimilarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burnt out. What helped was logging his data manually, through spreadsheets and connected trackers, to rebuild his energy.\nWhen he connected with Ben and Grey about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team. \n“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year.\nWith fresh capital and no plans to venture into wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand horizontally into more services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.\n“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app. We’re excited to support this team as they build the future of personal health.”\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:44 PM PDT · October 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe rise of agentic coding tools has been a sea change for software engineers across the industry — but for Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, it seems to have landed particularly hard. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Yakovenko said he’s become increasingly comfortable taking a back seat in software development tasks.\n“AI has been a great force multiplier for somebody who’s an expert,” said Yakovenko, describing his experience with agentic coding after more than 15 years developing software. “Now I can just watch Claude churning through its thing and I can almost smell when it’s going off the rails.”\n“If people are in a meeting with me and I’m not paying attention,” he continued, “it’s because I’m watching Claude.”\nCo-founder of the Solana cryptocurrency protocol, Yakovenko has seen immense success this year, even as many cryptocurrencies have struggled. The system announced $2.85 billion in annual revenue earlier this month, fueled largely by crypto trading platforms. Even more impressive was the Solana coin’s first exchange-traded fund (or ETF), launched the day before Yakovenko took the stage. Launched by the crypto asset manager Bitwise, the fund saw nearly $70 million of inflows in a single day.\nOnstage, Yakovenko attributed the success to a growing acceptance of crypto, especially from the conventional finance industry. “If you are a back-office finance person, you actually get crypto much, much faster,” Yakovenko said. “Finance people deal with settlement risk all the time. They deal with banking risk all the time.”\nOver the same period, cryptocurrency has drawn significant new criticism for enabling public bribery, particularly in connection with the Solana-hosted Trumpcoin. The coin has directed an estimated $350 million to the president, which critics see as a form of bribery — particularly in the wake of Trump’s high-profile pardons for Tron founder Justin Sun and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\nBut as long as Solana is an open protocol, Yakovenko has little control over the coins it hosts. “I could send you an email with a link to Trumpcoin or Fartcoin,” Yakovenko explained onstage, “and both of those are protocols, both the email and the underlying protocol that creates that market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nBox co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn’t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.\n “Generally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems — just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,” explained Levie.\n“If you’re doing something mission critical — we’ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn’t expect. So you want to have some sort of ‘church and state’ between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.”\nHe painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said. \nIn addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS. \n“The thing that I’m very convinced of is we’ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you’ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,” Levie said.\nAs a result, the typical “per-seat” business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents. \nThese changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes. \nSmaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.\nThis presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.\nHe encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building. \n“We are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is — there’s a complete platform shift happening in tech that’s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,” Levie said.\n“And I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe 2024 runner-up in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, geCKo Materials, returned to the stage at this year’s show to debut new products as it pushes deeper into commercializing its tech.\nFounder Dr. Capella Kerst revealed four new uses of geCKo’s super-strong dry adhesive: a semiconductor wafer handling tool, a robotic gripper for smooth surfaces (like solar panels or glass), a curved robotic “end effector” for more irregular shapes, and an all-purpose gripper for robotic arms.\nThe geCKo tech is inspired by the way real-life lizards use their feet to grip surfaces. Kerst positions it like a new form of Velcro, but one that leaves no residue, can quickly attach and detach, and requires no electrical charge or suction. A one-inch tile of the material can hold 16 pounds, and the geCKo dry adhesive can attach as many as 120,000 times — and can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or years.\nThe ability to quickly adapt the dry adhesive to existing manufacturing, picking, and other robotic applications has proven popular. Kerst’s company won over Ford, NASA, and Pacific Gas & Electric as customers before she even competed on last year’s Battlefield stage.\n“Has this year flown by as quickly for anybody else as it has for us?” Kerst said on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage on Wednesday. The geCKo CEO said her company has tripled the size of her team since last year’s show and completed an $8 million fundraise. And geCKo’s dry adhesive was used on six space missions in the last year — a testament to the material’s ability to work in multiple environments, including a vacuum, according to Kerst.\nOnstage Wednesday, Kerst showed off a Fanuc robotic arm using six geCKo tiles to quickly grab and move objects around, before showing videos of the other commercialized applications.\nIn one of those videos, Kerst showed geCKo’s material being used to safely move semiconductor wafers faster than current suction or vacuum tech allows.\n“Our customers at TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Kawasaki said we have a goal to [move the wafers] at 2Gs of acceleration,” she said. “We decided to blow them out of the water and do 5.4Gs of acceleration repeatedly, reliably, using geCKo materials.”  \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

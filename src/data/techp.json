Workday co-founder and former CEO Aneel Bhusri will return as CEO.\nEschenbach joined Workday in December 2022 as co-CEO alongside Bhusri and had been operating as the company’s sole CEO since February 2024. Bhusri, who had led the company since 2009 — sometimes as co-CEO, sometimes as sole CEO — has been serving as the company’s executive chairman since 2024.\nWorkday confirmed to TechCrunch that Bhusri is returning to the role permanently, as opposed to taking the helm during a search for a replacement.\nWorkday says it made this leadership change to focus on its next chapter, which, unsurprisingly, is AI.\n“We’re now entering one of the most pivotal moments in our history,” Bhusri said in the company’s press release Monday. “AI is a bigger transformation than SaaS — and it will define the next generation of market leaders. I’m energized to return as CEO, working alongside our presidents Gerrit Kazmaier and Rob Enslin, and I’m excited about the opportunity in front of us.”\nLast February, Workday laid off 8.5% of its headcount, or 1,750 people, with Eschenbach stating at the time that the company needed a new approach to labor in the age of AI.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

The company is reportedly in talks to raise another $200 million at an $11 billion valuation led by Sequoia and Singapore’s GIC, sources told Forbes.\nIf the deal closes, Harvey’s valuation would jump by $3 billion in a matter of months. In December the company confirmed it had raised $160 million at an $8 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz last fall. (Harvey declined to comment on its potential new raise.)\nBack in June, it announced a $300 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue. A few months before that, in February 2025, it gobbled up a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation.\nThe startup, which offers an LLM AI for law firms, hit an annual recurring revenue rate of $190 million by the end of 2025, founder CEO Winston Weinberg shared on LinkedIn. That was up from a $100 million ARR in August (depending on what the company means by ARR), so that’s nearly double the contracted revenue in less than six months.\nHow has it become one of the breakout winners of AI enterprise applications? Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos an incredible story of how the company originally claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n\n"

The deal, paid entirely in cryptocurrency to an unknown seller, shatters previous records. (Broker Larry Fischer, who facilitated the sale, is presumably celebrating his good fortune.)\nMarszalek plans to debut the site during Sunday’s big game, offering consumers a personal AI agent for messaging, app usage, and stock trading. “If you take a long-term view — 10 to 20 years — [AI] is going to be one of the greatest technological waves of our lifetime,” he told the FT.\nThe purchase rewrites the domain record books — not that the crypto industry itself is known for its restraint when it comes to spending. Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner went bankrupt trying to monetize it.\n“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”\nWhether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question. But for Marszalek, who already owns Crypto.com and dropped $700 million on stadium naming rights, owning two category-defining domains is apparently worth the outlay.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

And after placing third on the charts last weekend, “Melania” is ninth this time.\nPerhaps anticipating discussion about the film’s decline, Amazon released a statement from its head of domestic theatrical distribution, Kevin Wilson, who said, “Together, theatrical and streaming represent two distinct value creating moments that amplify the film’s overall impact.”\n“Melania” received universally negative reviews from critics, but its 99% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes was so good that the site put out a statement insisting that the score was real.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n"

It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours.\nTo use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive.\nThe new feature comes as Snapchat announced last summer that Snap Map now has more than 400 million monthly active users.\nSnap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and find things to do.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith its Home Safe and Arrival Notifications features, Snapchat is looking to further compete with services like the family location-sharing app Life360 and Apple’s “Find My.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The company raised $13 billion in equity funding just five months ago, but intense competition between frontier labs and the ongoing cost of compute has made it eager to raise as quickly as possible.\nFirms expected to participate in the round include Altimeter Capital Management, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Coatue Management, Iconiq Capital, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, but the bulk of the funding is said to come from the company’s strategic partners Nvidia and Microsoft.\nAnthropic is building on recent successes, most notably the deployment of its coding agents, which have software engineers raving about increased coding productivity. Last week, the company’s release of new models focused on legal and business research rattled the share prices of publicly traded data firms as investors worried about the ability of AI to disrupt their businesses.\nAnthropic’s rival, OpenAI, is reportedly assembling a new $100 billion fundraising round, and both companies are thought to be preparing IPOs ahead of a blockbuster summer in the markets, with xAI, recently acquired by SpaceX, also tapping public equity as part of the rocket maker’s IPO.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nYouTube on Monday introduced lower-priced YouTube TV plans that will allow subscribers to better tailor their plans to their own interests in areas like sports, news, and entertainment. The company said that it will offer more than 10 different plans to choose from, all priced below the $82.99 per month main YouTube TV plan that has access to more than 100 networks. The new plans will start rolling out this week.\nWhile that main plan will not go away, the new plans will allow customers to pick what matters most and what they could do without in return for cost savings. \nImage Credits:YouTube\nAmong the new plans are a $64.99 per month Sports plan, a Sports + News plan for $71.99 per month, a less expensive Entertainment plan for $54.99 per month, and a $69.99 per month News + Entertainment + Family plan, which includes kids’ content.\nThe Sports plans include all major broadcasters, plus networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, and ESPN Unlimited. This plan is $18 cheaper per month than the main plan.\nYouTube TV’s news channels include CNBC, Fox News, CNN, MS NOW, and Bloomberg, along with other national news channels. Combined with Sports, the package is priced $11 lower per month than the main YouTube TV plan.\nThe entertainment-only plan is $28 cheaper per month than the main plan, and includes major broadcasters as well as FX, Hallmark, Comedy Central, Bravo, Paramount, Food Network, and HGTV. Families with small kids can add other channels like Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Cartoon Network, and PBS Kids for a bit more.\nThe company is also offering discounts for new subscribers, which could lower the price of certain plans further for either the first few months or the first year. Subscribers will continue to have access to YouTube TV’s unlimited DVR, support for up to six family members on one account, multiview, and more.\nOther add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket + RedZone, HBO Max, and 4K Plus can also be purchased to customize plans further.\nThe company says all the new plans will roll out over the next several weeks. \nCustomized packages are now not a new idea in streaming — à la carte options were a key part of the early streaming pioneer Sling TV’s initial offering, for instance. This element of personalization was also one of the factors that was meant to make streaming a better alternative to traditional pay TV, where consumers often ended up paying for channels they didn’t want.\nBut as streamers added more content, networks, and, in particular, sports programming, the cost of streaming inched back up to compete with cable and linear television. Live TV streamers like YouTube TV may have offered convenience and some savings over still more expensive cable, but it wasn’t exactly affordable anymore.\nThese new packages hit the market at a time when consumer confidence is at its lowest in more than 11 years, due to fears about the labor market and higher prices, which have made consumers more cautious about their spending.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOpenAI on Monday announced it’s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers.\nThe newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was introduced globally in mid-January.\nSubscribers to OpenAI’s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said.\nOpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a blog post: “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”\nThe move, which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran yesterday from a top rival, Anthropic.\nIn its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman got extremely testy about his competitor’s jabs, calling the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nConsumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a backlash late last year when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.\nWhile understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.\nIn tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.\nUsers will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time.

    "body": "\nMusicboard, an app for music discovery and recommendations, has been struggling, according to its users. Over the past several months, users said the app experienced outages, the website went offline, and the Android app disappeared from the Play Store.\nThis has concerned its devoted, if small, user base. (The app has been downloaded around 462,000 times to date, according to market intelligence provider Appfigures.) On Reddit, users have been recommending alternatives and offering each other support as they wait for any update.\nWhile it’s not surprising for an app to shut down, when there’s still an active user base, apps typically provide some sort of communication from their operators. But Musicboard users say they haven’t heard anything, leaving them to reach out to the press for help getting in touch with someone, if only to let them export their data.\nImage Credits:Musicboard\nSome users organized an unofficial “Help Save Musicboard” initiative to bring more attention to the matter. The group is led by the Musicboard user known as Lavarini and run by volunteers.\nTechCrunch contacted Musicboard to help these users get some answers and was provided a short statement. However, the statement didn’t explain the longer-term issues and dismissed the outages as “temporary downtime.”\nThe statement, shared from the Musicboard team email address and signed simply as “Musicboard,” said the following:\n\nApp is not shut down. The servers had temporary downtime, which has now been quickly fixed. And we’re working together with the Google Play team to get the app back up there. The app wouldn’t shut down without a respectful timeline for the users and official communication. App is staying live.\n\nFollow-up questions went unanswered.\nThe founders of Musicboard, Johannes Vermandois and Erik Heimer, have been involved with other projects. Their AI app, Frank AI, was set to be acquired by a company called Freedom Holdings, Inc., but the potential acquirer terminated its letter of intent in September 2024. Dreamsands, Inc., the company that publishes Frank AI on the App Store, also operates another app, Helm, an AI therapist.\nOver email, Lavarini says the users’ efforts to help save the app will continue.\nThe Help Save Musicboard initiative “aims to support awareness and discussion around the long-term sustainability of the indie app Musicboard and its community,” Lavarini wrote.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nLidar-maker Ouster has acquired StereoLabs, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares. \nThe deal is the latest in a march towards consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar for $33 million. Ouster itself has played the M&A game a fair amount, too. In 2022, the company merged with rival player Velodyne. The year before that, it bought lidar startup Sense Photonics.\nThis consolidation is happening right as companies and investors rush to build businesses around “physical AI” — a broad term that encompasses everything from humanoid robotics and drones to self-driving cars and automated systems in warehouses. Even more obscure suppliers are raising big funding rounds as these technologies develop. Some startups are even trying to spin up entirely new sensor modalities.\nOuster cofounder and CEO Angus Pacala told TechCrunch in an interview that he had been eyeing StereoLabs for years. He said he sees lidar as “the core component of safety-critical, capable systems,” but that he wanted to “move up the stack.” \nThe “obvious additional sensors” to start working with in addition to lidar, Pacala said, are cameras. Pacala said 15-year-old StereoLabs is “best in class” on the hardware side, but he was especially drawn to how the company has been getting the most out of those cameras by being “incredibly savvy in adopting the cutting edge of AI models and edge compute.” \nIn particular, Pacala highlighted StereoLabs’ development of a foundational AI model that can determine depth of objects from stereo cameras. \n“It was a no brainer for us to go out and approach them and basically pitch this vision of working with us to become a unified sensing and perception platform — a tier one [supplier] for these advanced physical AI systems,” Pacala said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDespite the focus on integration, Ouster said StereoLabs will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary. \nAnd while the hype has been feverish, Pacala said he didn’t buy StereoLabs simply because of the attention and money being thrown at physical AI. In fact, he committed maybe the gravest sin one can during a hype cycle: he poured some cold water on the buzz, especially around humanoid robotics.\n“The business model here is not to just sell the fervor, it’s to actually make working systems that are certified, that are safe, that are really solving customer problems,” he said. “There’s going to be a little bit of disillusionment in physical AI as it turns out that it’s much longer time to market for all these humanoids.”\nPacala isn’t the only one trying to take a realistic view. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said the sensor industry is “ripe for consolidation” because he believes there isn’t enough revenue to support all the current competition.\n“You’re going to get consolidation, or you’re going to get kind of a weeding out of the industry as people fall to the wayside,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nLyft launched teen accounts on Monday, a product that allows minors as young as 13 to hail a ride without an adult in 200 U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and New York.\nThe official launch comes two weeks after Lyft CEO David Risher announced on X plans to open the ride-hailing service to teenagers.\nLike its rival Uber, which also offers teen accounts, the new Lyft service comes with a number of guardrails. Only a parent or guardian can create a teen account, according to Lyft. Drivers who are matched with these underage passengers must meet additional criteria and pass yearly background checks. Teens can also bring guests along for the ride, as long as the parent has given permission, according to Lyft.\nLyft has also baked in features like PIN verification, audio recording, and real-time tracking to allow parents to see where their teen is during their ride. Parents who want to sign up their teen can go to the app, select their profile at the bottom right of the screen, then tap “Lyft Teen.” From here, parents can enter the teen’s contact info and add a shared payment method to cover teen rides. Once confirmed, the teen will receive a text message with a unique sign-up link.\nLyft is playing catch-up with Uber and even Waymo, which offers teen accounts in its robotaxi service area in Phoenix. Uber tested teen accounts as early as 2017 but didn’t roll out a commercial product until spring 2024 in more than a dozen cities in the U.S. and Canada. Uber has since added numerous other U.S. markets, as well as dozens of other countries. Last year, Uber started testing out teen accounts in several cities in India, as well.\nLyft’s new teen account is one of numerous new products and expansions that Risher has introduced at the company since he took the CEO spot. Lyft has made a handful of autonomous vehicle partnerships, including with May Mobility, Austrian manufacturer Benteler, and Holon, Tensor Auto, and autonomy provider Mobileye.\nThe company has also pushed into Europe with its $197 million acquisition of German multi-mobility app Freenow from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility.

    "body": "\nA hacktivist has scraped more than half-a-million payment records from a provider of consumer-grade “stalkerware” phone surveillance apps, exposing the email addresses and partial payment information of customers who paid to spy on others. \nThe transactions contain records of payments for phone-tracking services like Geofinder and uMobix, as well as services like Peekviewer (formerly Glassagram), which purport to allow access to private Instagram accounts, among several other monitoring and tracking apps provided by the same vendor, a Ukrainian company called Struktura.\nThe customer data also includes transaction records from Xnspy, a known phone surveillance app, which in 2022 spilled the private data from tens of thousands of unsuspecting people’s Android devices and iPhones. \nThis is the latest example of a surveillance vendor exposing the information of its customers due to security flaws. Over the past few years, dozens of stalkerware apps have been hacked, or have managed to lose, spill, or expose people’s private data — often the victims themselves — thanks to shoddy cybersecurity by the stalkerware operators.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tTo contact Zack Whittaker securely, reach out via Signal username zackwhittaker.1337. Contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nStalkerware apps like uMobix and Xnspy, once planted on someone’s phone, upload the victim’s private data, including their call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, and precise location data, which is then shared with the person who planted the app. \nApps like uMobix and Xnspy have explicitly marketed their services for people to spy on their spouses and domestic partners, which is illegal.\nThe data, seen by TechCrunch, included about 536,000 lines of customer email addresses, which app or brand the customer paid for, how much they paid, the payment card type (such as Visa or Mastercard), and the last four digits on the card. The customer records did not include dates of payments. \nTechCrunch verified the data was authentic by taking several transaction records containing disposable email addresses with public inboxes, such as Mailinator, and running them through the various password reset portals provided by the various surveillance apps. By resetting the passwords on accounts associated with public email addresses, we determined that these were real accounts.\nWe also verified the data by matching each transaction’s unique invoice number from the leaked dataset with the surveillance vendor’s checkout pages. We could do this because the checkout page allowed us to retrieve the same customer and transaction data from the server without needing a password.\nThe hacktivist, who goes by the moniker “wikkid,” told TechCrunch they scraped the data from the stalkerware vendor thanks to a “trivial” bug in its website. The hacktivist said they “have fun targeting apps that are used to spy on people,” and subsequently published the scraped data on a known hacking forum.\nThe hacking forum listing lists the surveillance vendor as Ersten Group, which presents itself as a U.K.-presenting software development startup. \nTechCrunch found several email addresses in the dataset used for testing and customer support instead reference Struktura, a Ukrainian company that has an identical website to Ersten Group. The earliest record in the dataset contained the email address for Struktura’s chief executive, Viktoriia Zosim, for a transaction of $1. \nRepresentatives for Ersten Group did not respond to our requests for comment. Struktura’s Zosim did not return a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nBusinesses are generating more video than ever. From years of broadcast archives to thousands of store cameras and countless hours of production footage, most of it just sits unused on servers, unwatched and unanalyzed. This is dark data: a massive, untapped resource that companies collect automatically but almost never use in a meaningful way.\nTo tackle the problem, Aza Kai (CEO) and Hiraku Yanagita (COO), two former Googlers who spent nearly a decade working together at Google Japan, decided to build their own solution. The duo co-founded InfiniMind, a Tokyo-based startup developing infrastructure that converts petabytes of unviewed video and audio into structured, queryable business data.\n“My co-founder, who spent a decade leading brand and data solutions at Google Japan, and I saw this inflection point coming while we were still at Google,” Kai said. By 2024, the technology had matured, and the market demand had become clear enough that the co-founders felt compelled to build the company themselves, he added.\nKai, who previously worked at Google Japan across cloud, machine learning, ad systems, and video recommendation models and later led data science teams, explained that current solutions force a trade-off. Earlier approaches could label objects in individual frames, but they couldn’t track narratives, understand causality, or answer complex questions about video content. For clients with decades of broadcast archives and petabytes of footage, even basic questions about their content often went unanswered.\nWhat really changed was the progress in vision-language models between 2021 and 2023. That’s when video AI started moving beyond simple object tagging, Kai noted. Falling GPU costs and annual performance gains of roughly 15% to 20% over the last decade helped, but the bigger story was capability — until recently, models just couldn’t do the job, he told TechCrunch.\nInfiniMind recently secured $5.8 million in seed funding, led by UTEC and joined by CX2, Headline Asia, Chiba Dojo, and an AI researcher at a16z Scout. The company is relocating its headquarters to the U.S., while it continues to operate an office in Japan. Japan provided the perfect testbed: strong hardware, talented engineers, and a supportive startup ecosystem, allowing the team to fine-tune its technology with demanding customers before going global.\nIts first product, TV Pulse, launched in Japan in April 2025. The AI-powered platform analyzes television content in real time, helping media and retail companies “track product exposure, brand presence, customer sentiment, and PR impact,” per the startup. After pilot programs with major broadcasters and agencies, it already has paying customers, including wholesalers and media companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNow, InfiniMind is ready for the international market. Its flagship product, DeepFrame, a long-form video intelligence platform capable of processing 200 hours of footage to pinpoint specific scenes, speakers, or events, is scheduled for a beta release in March, followed by a full launch in April 2026, Kai said.\nImage Credits:infinimind\nThe video analysis space is highly fragmented. Companies such as TwelveLabs provide general-purpose video understanding APIs for a broad range of users, including consumers, prosumers, and enterprises, Kai said, while InfiniMind focuses specifically on enterprise use cases, including monitoring, safety, security, and analyzing video content for deeper insights.\n“Our solution requires no code; clients bring their data, and our system processes it, providing actionable insights,” Kai said. “We also integrate audio, sound, and speech understanding, not just visuals. Our system can handle unlimited video length, and cost efficiency is a major differentiator. Most existing solutions prioritize accuracy or specific use cases but don’t solve cost challenges.”\nThe seed funding will help the team continue developing the DeepFrame model, expand engineering infrastructure, hire more engineers, and reach additional customers across Japan and the U.S.\n“This is an exciting space, one of the paths toward AGI,” Kai said. “Understanding general video intelligence is about understanding reality. Industrial applications are important, but our ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of technology to better understand reality and help humans make better decisions.”\n"

    "body": "\nUber has agreed to acquire the delivery business of Turkey’s Getir, once one of the biggest success stories of the country’s startup ecosystem, the company announced on Monday.\nThe deal will see Uber paying $335 million at the outset to purchase Getir’s food delivery business. The ride-hailing giant will also pay $100 million for a 15% stake in Getir’s grocery, retail, and water delivery business, and said it would complete the acquisition of the division over the next few years.\nUber is buying the business from Getir’s biggest shareholder, the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The investment firm was reportedly seeking to sell its stake in the company last year.\nThe deal comes after a turbulent few years for Getir, which once enjoyed a valuation of $12 billion, that saw the startup scale down its operations massively. The company launched to great traction in 2015, and invested aggressively to expand its operations in the U.S. and Europe, both organically and via acquisitions, especially during the pandemic.\nBut after the pandemic lockdowns eased, broader consumer demand for food and grocery delivery also wavered, and Getir chose to cut its losses in 2024, shutting shop and laying off thousands of staff in the U.S., U.K., and Europe in order to focus on business back home.\nNearly a year ago, the company went through a struggle for control over a restructuring plan proposed by Mubadala. The plan was opposed by one of Getir’s co-founders, who eventually sued to fight the “illegal coup,” but a Dutch court rejected the founder’s appeals.\nThe company has raised a total of $2.40 billion so far, according to PitchBook. Documents filed by Getir in court last year show the company valued its group assets at $374 million.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“This transaction reflects the strength of the business and the progress it has made, particularly over the last year,” Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy group CEO at Mubadala, said in a statement.\nUber said it would combine the new unit’s services with Trendyol Go, a food and grocery delivery service in Turkey that the ride-hail giant bought for $700 million last May. Uber said Getir’s food delivery business alone recorded gross bookings of more than $1 billion in 2025, up 50% from a year earlier.\nThe deal follows a strong showing by Uber’s delivery business in the fourth quarter, reporting revenue of $4.89 billion, up 30% from a year earlier. The company said Europe, the Middle East, and Asia proved the fastest-growing regions for the business in 2026.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

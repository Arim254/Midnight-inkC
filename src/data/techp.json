The company previously raised a $33 million Series A, which it announced in April 2024.\nThe new round was led by Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize with participation from Alumni Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. Veery Maxwell at Galvanize will be joining the board, as will former Nest CFO Tom vonReichbauer. (The latter should come as no surprise given that many Quilters used to work at Nest.)\nThe new funding will go toward expanding the company’s footprint. Quilt has installed nearly 1,000 units in 16 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, co-founder and CEO Paul Lambert said in a note posted on the company’s website.\nQuilt has been a rare startup challenging entrenched incumbents in the heat pump market. To unseat them, the company has taken a software- and design-first approach. One example is an over-the-air update the company pushed to heat pumps that were already installed; the new software and firmware improved the performance of existing units by more than 20%.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAlumni Ventures, Climate, energy impact partners, Fundraising, Galvanize, Gradient Ventures, heat pumps, In Brief, Incite Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, quilt\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Climate\n"

Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was first reported by CNBC.\nThe letter was an appeal for investment into Tiger Global’s next venture capital fund and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo. In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring.\nThat number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too.

Skild didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank and Nvidia declined to comment.\nUnlike other heavily funded startups, Skild AI is not building proprietary hardware. Instead, it’s developing a robot-agnostic foundation model that can be customized for various types of robots and use cases.\nThe company unveiled its general-purpose robot model Skild Brain in July with videos showing robots picking up dishes and climbing up and down the stairs. The company has secured strategic partnerships with LG CNS and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to develop its ecosystem.\nInvestor interest in AI robotics has been steadily growing. Physical Intelligence, another company developing “brains” for a broad range of robots, has reportedly recently raised $600 million at a $5.6 billion valuation led by CapitalG. One investor who evaluated but declined to fund Physical Intelligence told TechCrunch that its model is still in the early stages of development.\nIn September, Figure, a company developing a humanoid robot, raised more than $1 billion at a massive $39 billion valuation. Meanwhile, 1X, another humanoid robot developer, was in talks to secure as much as $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation, The Information reported several months ago.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Startups\n"

Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. \nThe discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with.\nThe move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content.\nWhile some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms.\nIt’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. \nThe new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlthough a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction. For example, OpenAI in September launched Sora, a social media platform of just AI videos. Meta also has a short-form video feed of AI-generated videos called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others.\nLeading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season.\nDespite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”\nTo address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. \nThe feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.\nImage Credits:Hinge\nConvo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. \nThis new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.\nHowever, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. \nHinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness.\nDuring that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.”\nPIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported. \nIn 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups, according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations.\nWhen interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way.\nAfter the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund, and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role, while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, Bloomberg reported at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund.\nNow, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.\nStill, in a nod to the need for more caution than in previous years, the letter promised a more targeted approach. It acknowledged that leaning into AI investments could be risky and require “humility” because “valuations are elevated and, in our view, sometimes unsupported by company fundamentals,” according to CNBC. (Tiger Global could not be immediately reached for comment.)\nIn other words, even as Tiger Global raises a fresh fund to go after more big AI opportunities, it’s implying that the AI market is in a bubble, and it doesn’t want to drive valuations to even higher, perhaps unrealistic, heights.\n"

    "body": "\nAs energy demand for data centers soars, environmental groups are calling for a moratorium on the approval and construction of new facilities.\nMore than 230 organizations, including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. \n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. \nSeveral studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills.\nElectricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade.\nThe effects are expected to be felt most in a handful of states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are slated for the largest increase in data center capacity.\nEnergy demand for data centers is expected to nearly triple in the coming decade, up from 40 gigawatts today to 106 gigawatts in 2035. Much of that will take place in rural areas.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“All this compounds the significant and concerning impacts AI is having on society, including lost jobs, social instability and economic concentration,” the environmental groups said.\nProposed data centers have become a flash point in recent days. \nLast week, protestors marched outside the headquarters of utility DTE in Detroit. The company is requesting approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission to supply OpenAI and Oracle with electricity for a 1.4 gigawatt data center. Protestors said they were concerned about the data center driving up electricity bills, using too much fresh water, and snarling traffic.\nAlso last week, three people were arrested in Wisconsin during a common council meeting about a 902 megawatt data center that’s slated to be part of OpenAI and Oracle’s Stargate project.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe former chief engineer of Lucid Motors, Eric Bach, has sued the company for wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation, and claims one of the automaker’s top HR executives referred to him as a “German Nazi.” \nThe federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Northern District of California, claims Bach was stripped of his responsibilities overseeing the powertrain division in early 2025 as a result of an HR investigation into the company’s workplace culture. Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. \nBach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident.  \nTechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. \nBach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. \nHe claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.”\nThe lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLucid has also been churning through executives. The company’s VP of engineering left on the same day Bach claims to have been fired, as TechCrunch previously reported. Former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February, and the company has still not named a permanent replacement. Lucid’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing all left within the last year, too.\nBach, in the complaint, claims to have been ascendant before the internal investigation. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” \nBach states that Lucid’s chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach’s loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose’) and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint.\nThe workplace culture investigation launched in late 2024, which Bach claims was “tainted by HR’s racist beliefs,” “initially resulted in Bach losing significant responsibilities.” The HR department told Bach at the time that he contributed to a poor culture at the company, according to the complaint. In addition to losing oversight of the powertrain team, Bach claims to have been excluded from board meetings.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAnthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. \nPreviously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests.\nThe move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work.\nCursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots.\nFor Slack, positioning itself as an “agentic hub” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work.\nBy letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows.\nWhile Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude’s API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nAn increasing number of browsers are experimenting with agentic features that will take actions on your behalf, such as booking tickets or shopping for different items. However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. \nGoogle detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months.\nThe company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.\nImage Credits:Google\nWhat’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.\n“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. \nGoogle is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.\nImage Credits:google\nThe search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. \nAI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released a new open source content detection model to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Creators can add their own media and customize the templates to their style. They also have the option to create and submit their own original templates.\nTo get started, creators need a free Premiere mobile login to access the space and a YouTube profile to publish directly to their Shorts feed. Creators can download Adobe Premiere from the App Store and tap the “Create for YouTube” option to access the creation space. \nFrom there, they can upload clips from their iPhone camera roll, cloud storage, or Adobe Creative Cloud. They can then cut and trim clips, layer in video and audio tracks, adjust color and brightness, and add text overlays and captions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAfter following export prompts, creators can upload the finished product to YouTube. \n“New tools and capabilities in the app, like templates, effects, transitions, and this new content creation space for YouTube Short creation, will be powerful for all creators, from longtime creators to those just getting started,” Keane said. “It brings creators polished video editing with studio-quality audio, AI sound effects, precision multi-track editing, Firefly AI content generation, and more to make producing and sharing their content easier and faster.

    "body": "\nA stalkerware maker who was banned from the surveillance industry after a data breach that exposed the personal information of its customers, as well as the people they were spying on, will not be able to go back to selling the invasive software, according the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\nThe FTC denied a request to cancel that ban made by Scott Zuckerman, the founder of consumer spyware company Support King and its subsidiaries SpyFone and OneClickMonitor. \nOn Monday, the FTC announced the denial in a press release after Zuckerman petitioned the federal watchdog to rescind or modify the ban order in July of this year. \nIn 2021, the FTC banned Zuckerman from “offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,” effectively preventing him from running another stalkerware business. The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. \n“SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.”\nIn his petition, Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition. \nWhen reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe FTC ban stemmed from an incident in 2018, when a security researcher found an Amazon S3 bucket belonging to SpyFone that left extremely sensitive data — including selfies, text messages, chat app messages, audio recordings, contacts, location, hashed passwords and logins, and more — exposed online for anyone to see and access.\nThe exposed data included 44,109 unique email addresses and, according to the researcher who found the breach, “at least 2,208 current ‘customers’ and hundreds or thousands of photos and audio in each folder” from 3,666 phones that had the SpyFone stalkerware installed on them.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about stalkerware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nLess than a year after the 2021 FTC order, TechCrunch reported that Zuckerman appeared to be running another stalkerware company. In 2022, TechCrunch received a trove of breached data from stalkerware app SpyTrac. The data revealed that SpyTrac was run by freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, in what appeared to be an attempt to circumvent the FTC’s ban. Furthermore, the breached data included records from SpyFone, which Zuckerman was ordered to delete, and keys to access the cloud storage of OneClickMonitor, another one of his stalkerware apps. \nEva Galperin, a prominent expert on stalkerware, celebrated the news. “Mr. Zuckerman was clearly hoping that if he laid low for a few years, everyone would forget about the reasons why the FTC issued a ban not only against the company, but against him specifically,” Galperin told TechCrunch. \nTechCrunch’s revelation in 2022 that Zuckerman apparently violated the FTC ban, “suggests that Zuckerman did not learn his lesson,” added Galperin, who is the director of cybersecurity at the digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nStalkerware apps allow their customers to surreptitiously spy on the phones and devices of their loved ones. In addition to enabling potentially illegal activities, for the last eight years, there have been at least 26 stalkerware companies that have been hacked or left sensitive data exposed online, according to TechCrunch’s tally. These repeated incidents show these companies have repeatedly failed to protect the privacy of their customers, as well as the people they spy on.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

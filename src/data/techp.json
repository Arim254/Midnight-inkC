    "body": "\nUber and Lyft will start testing Baidu’s Apollo Go robotaxis in London in 2026, joining Waymo and local startup Wayve as companies that will have autonomous vehicles in the city next year.\nLyft CEO David Risher said in a post on X and LinkedIn that Lyft will start testing once it receives local regulatory approval. His company “plans to scale to hundreds” of Baidu’s electric RT6 SUVs from there, though he did not lay out a timeline for commercial launch.\nUber announced it plans to test the vehicles there next year as part of its own deal with Baidu, which the companies announced in July. The company said it expects to start testing in the first half of 2026.\nThe twin London rollouts are the latest in a series of robotaxi tie-ups that have seen Uber and Lyft strike deals with Baidu, Waymo, and many others in order to stand up operations in cities around the world.\n"

    "body": "\nThe war for the future of Warner Brothers continues, as Paramount Skydance announced Monday an amended all-cash offer for the legacy movie studio. The offer includes an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from a major backer, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to provide tens of billions in equity financing for the deal. It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison—the CEO of Paramount Skydance—to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.  \n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states. \nThe revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5th, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. \nThree days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it “illusory” and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal’s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”\nNow, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said. In October, CNBC reported that, prior to the Netflix deal, WBD had previously rejected three different takeover offers from Paramount. \n“Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,” said Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, in Monday’s press release. “Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice.” \nHe added: “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”\nTechCrunch reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:35 AM PST · December 22, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe CEO of SpaceX rival United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, has resigned after 12 years on the job “to pursue another opportunity,” according to the company. \n“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” United Launch Alliance (ULA) chairs Robert Lightfoot and Kay Sears said in a statement.\nBruno’s resignation comes at a time when newer private spaceflight companies are increasingly driving the launch market. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has dramatically upped its launch cadence in recent years, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking like a more serious player after the mostly successful inaugural missions of the New Glenn heavy-lift rocket.\nNow 20 years old, ULA was created by combining the space launch businesses of defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA was a main provider to both NASA and the Department of Defense until SpaceX came along and started winning contracts.\nOne of Bruno’s biggest projects during his time at ULA was overseeing the development of the joint venture’s next-generation rocket, Vulcan. That project had two main objectives: help ULA keep pace with SpaceX, and reduce the U.S. government’s reliance on Russian rockets to access space. \nVulcan leveraged a number of parts from prior ULA rocket programs like Atlas and Delta in an attempt to keep costs down, though it bet on Blue Origin to provide the engines. The project suffered numerous delays before it finally lifted off for the first time in 2024 — one whole decade after development began. \nDuring that same time frame, SpaceX became the world’s most dominant space launch provider, winning government contracts and taking on numerous private missions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nULA’s Vulcan rocket has found customers in Amazon (for its Leo internet satellites) and space startup Astrobotic. And the company is looking to make the rockets more reusable, or even fly upgraded versions that could theoretically take heavier payloads to space.\n“It has been a great privilege to lead ULA through its transformation and to bring Vulcan into service. My work here is now complete and I will be cheering ULA on,” Bruno said in a post on X.\nULA has tapped its chief operating officer John Elbon to serve as interim CEO while the company looks for a permanent replacement. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nChatGPT is releasing its own version of Spotify Wrapped. That is, the OpenAI-owned chatbot is now rolling out an annual review feature called “Your Year with ChatGPT” to eligible consumers in select markets, including the United States.\nOther English-speaking markets with access to the new offering include Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.\nAt launch, the feature will be offered to those with the free, Plus, and Pro plans who have the “reference saved memories” and “reference chat history” options turned on and have met a minimum conversation activity threshold, the company told TechCrunch via email.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTeam, Enterprise, or Education accounts will not be able to use the “Your Year with ChatGPT” feature. In addition, the experience is meant to be “lightweight, privacy-forward, and user-controlled,” the company noted. \nSimilar to other annual reviews offered by consumer apps, “Your Year with ChatGPT” takes inspiration from the popular year-end look back, Spotify Wrapped. Like Spotify’s feature, OpenAI uses catchy graphics and personalizes the experience to the individual by giving out “awards” based on how you’ve used ChatGPT throughout the year.\nFor instance, you might be awarded with the “Creative Debugger” if you used the chatbot to come up with solutions to a problem or worked through a concept or idea. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nThe app also creates a poem and an image about your year focused on your topics of interest. (We’re wondering how this will look next year as ChatGPT embraces adult content in 2026.)\nWhile the year-end wrap-up will be promoted on the ChatGPT app’s home screen, it won’t be forced on users or opened automatically. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nIt will be available on the ChatGPT web app and mobile app for iOS and Android, the company says. \nYou also can ask ChatGPT directly for “Your Year with ChatGPT” to trigger the experience.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that a Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service.\n“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”\nThe Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.”\n\nThe blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warning residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.\nWaymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections. The company also said that the majority of active trips were completed successfully.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.\nA letter from Tiger Global Management that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.\nThis post has been updated with Waymo’s statement that service is resuming.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

TikTok Shop has also recently expanded into luxury retail, another move to solidify its footing in e-commerce.\nUsers can load the gift cards with anything from $10 to $500. What sets these cards apart is the ability to personalize them using a wide variety of animated designs. There are also animations for thank-you cards, birthdays, weddings, and other occasions.\nGift cards are delivered via email, and recipients must have a TikTok account. Once redeemed, the card’s value is instantly credited to their TikTok Balance. Recipients can reply with a thank-you note or even send a gift card in return.\nHowever, the gift cards can only be purchased in the U.S. for now.\nImage Credits:TikTok Shop\nTikTok said it plans to add features that let users personalize gift cards more. By early 2026, users will be able to record or upload video messages to attach to their digital gift cards. A company spokesperson said the experience will also include an “interactive unboxing that captures their reaction in real-time,” but declined to share further details.\nThe launch of digital gift cards comes on the heels of a significant milestone for TikTok Shop: Over the four days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the app recorded sales of more than $500 million in the U.S.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, despite this achievement, TikTok Shop faces uncertainty as the sale of the app’s U.S. operations to an American investor group looms. If a sale doesn’t occur, TikTok faces a potential ban in the country. President Trump has extended the deadline to January 23, 2026, leaving the app’s future in the U.S. hanging in the balance.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t"

    "body": "\nResolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.\nThe headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.\nThe startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned. \nResolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.\nFounded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that Splunk acquired in 2019.\nWhile human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.\nThe automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.\nResolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.  \n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

Fill the machine with your spirit of choice in the designated reservoirs, then insert a cocktail capsule (an eight-pack costs around $20 and makes eight drinks) containing a mix of juices, bitters, and extracts.\nUse the touchscreen to adjust your preferred strength from mocktail to strong, then press mix.\niGulu – $549\nImage Credits:iGulu\nI’ve no doubt beer lovers will agree that there’s no matching the experience of sipping on a beer you’ve made yourself. iGulu’s automated beer brewer takes the drudgery out of the entire process, as it works with pre-packaged ingredient kits that include everything you need: extracts, hops, bitters, dry yeast, and ground grains. Just pour in the contents and add water. Even complete beginners can start brewing right away.\nEach kit is designed to brew one gallon, or eight pints. The fermentation takes 7 to 13 days, depending on the recipe. The built-in container keeps your beer cold and fresh for at least 30 days.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYou can also connect the brewer to an app to monitor fermentation time, carbonation levels, and adjust the temperature as needed.\nThe device is surprisingly versatile, too: Besides beer, the iGulu can also be used to make hard apple cider, kombucha, fruit wine, and non-alcoholic beverages like fermented tea, sparkling water, and even yogurt.\nBarsys Smart Coaster – $69\nImage Credits:Barsys\nFrom the folks who created a $1,500 robot bartender, the Barsys Coaster offers a more budget-friendly option for anyone learning how to avoid overpouring when making cocktails.\nThis smart coaster aims to help you prepare a well-blended beverage by lighting up to indicate when to start and stop pouring each ingredient. Simply connect it to the Barsys app, select a recipe, place a cup on the coaster, and follow the step-by-step guide.\nSmokpub Electric Smoker – $55\nImage Credits:SmokPub\nWant to get fancy and serve smoked cocktails? Even if you don’t, a cocktail and whiskey smoker is a fun gadget to have. \nThis one from Smokpub allows you to add smoky flavors to your drinks without using open flames. Simply load it with wood chips — available flavors include oak, apple, hickory, cherry, pear, and beech — put it on your glass with the safety cover, press the electric ignition, and let the smoke infuse your drink.\nSipVault Smart Liquor Dispenser – $55.95\nImage Credits:SipVault\nThis may not be the fanciest pick on the list, but an automatic dispenser is a practical choice for pouring drinks with consistency and avoiding spills, especially when mixing multiple drinks. Now that the holidays are upon us, this may prove handy if you want to avoid clumsy hands accidentally knocking over expensive bottles at your next holiday party.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "Instead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate.",
    "body": "\nThe future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.\nInstead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader “Automotive Package” designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.\nIf the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.\n“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”\nDouglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.\nTheir appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.\nIndustry split on timeline\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEven within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”\nUnlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.\nIssam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”\nTo be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.\nThe plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”\nMixed signals\nStill, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.\nAlready, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.\nAnother uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.\nThe debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia's new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire's social media activity.",
    "body": "\nSequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.\nIn since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.\nFast Company republished two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter was later published supporting Maguire.\nThe newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”\n“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.\nHowever, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.\nLin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire’s firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”\nTechCrunch has reached out to Sequoia for comment.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nGovernor Kathy Hochul has signed the RAISE Act, positioning New York as the second U.S. state to enact major AI safety legislation.\nState lawmakers passed the RAISE Act in June, but following lobbying from the tech industry, Hochul proposed changes to scale the bill back. The New York Times reports that Hochul ultimately agreed to sign the original bill, while lawmakers agreed to make her requested changes next year.\nThe bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours. It will also create a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development.\nIf companies fail to submit safety reports or make false statements, they can be fined up to $1 million ($3 million for subsequent violations).\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom signed a similar safety bill in September, which Hochul referenced in her announcement.\n“This law builds on California’s recently adopted framework, creating a unified benchmark among the country’s leading tech states as the federal government lags behind, failing to implement common-sense regulations that protect the public,” Hochul said.\nNew York state senator Andrew Gounardes, one of the bill’s sponsors, posted, “Big Tech thought they could weasel their way into killing our bill. We shut them down and passed the strongest AI safety law in the country.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBoth OpenAI and Anthropic expressed support for New York’s bill while also calling for federal legislation, with Anthropic’s head of external affairs Sarah Heck telling the NYT, “The fact that two of the largest states in the country have now enacted AI transparency legislation signals the critical importance of safety and should inspire Congress to build on them.”\nNot everyone in the tech industry has been so supportive. In fact, a super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI president Greg Brockman is looking to challenge Assemblyman Alex Bores, who co-sponsored the bill with Gounardes. (Bores told journalists, “I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it.”)\nThis comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws. The order — backed by Trump’s AI czar David Sacks — is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to curtail states’ ability to regulate AI and will likely be challenged in court.\nWe also discussed Trump’s executive order, and the role that Sacks and a16z have played in opposing state AI regulation, on the latest episode of the Equity podcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nThe team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses. To try out the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies, the team built a new app called Splat, which lets you turn any photo into a coloring book page for kids.\nAs any parent will tell you, kids love to color. And thanks to the web, there’s a seemingly infinite number of coloring book pages available for printing at home. \nHowever, many of the websites hosting these pages are filled with ads and other clutter, making them difficult to navigate. Other times, the printable pages are only available for a small fee, which some parents don’t want to pay, given the disposable nature of much of kids’ scribbled-on art projects.  \nScreenshotImage Credits:Lone Palm Labs/Splat\nThat inspired Retro’s team to develop an app for printing coloring book pages at home — from either your own photos or those it provides in kid-friendly, educational categories, such as animals, space, flowers, fairy tales, robots, cars, and more.\nTo get started with Splat, you’ll take a picture or pick a photo from your Camera Roll. You can then choose what style of photo you’d like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color.\nInstead of requiring a tedious sign-up process, the app will step you through customization options the first time you begin creating. Here, you’re prompted to choose your preferred app icon and check off the various categories your child likes. You also can choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don’t want them sucked into a TV show or game).\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nYou can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures. The weekly option allows for 25 pages per week, and the annual option provides 500 pages per year. The option to purchase or access the settings is blocked from small children by a pop-up that requires the parent’s birth year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn brief tests, the app worked as promised, and the generation time was brief, allowing you to quickly move from idea to printed art, ready for coloring, cutouts, or anything else your child wants to do. \nSplat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids’ creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time.\nSplat is available on iOS and Android.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nYears ago, when venture capitalist Jon Medved took an interest in backing various health tech startups, he had no idea that one day, he would need them to improve his own quality of life. \nIsrael’s tight-knit startup community received a blow in October when Medved, one of its most famous VCs, announced he was retiring immediately. He was forced to step down from the firm he founded, OurCrowd, after he was diagnosed with the debilitating disease of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS,) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. \n“This has come rather sudden,” he told TechCrunch in an audibly hoarse voice — a symptom of ALS — on what could be his last interview. \n“I had been feeling a little weird before and they didn’t know what was ailing me,” he explained. “I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering, and that’s when they tested me and said, ‘You’ve got ALS,’ which is a horrible disease, the worst you can imagine.”  \nALS is a condition that degrades the brain’s motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle control, eventually impairing walking, talking, eating, and breathing. He didn’t have the classic symptoms, as his voice was attacked first, not his extremities, he said. But he knows that the condition will worsen, and there is no cure, only therapies. \nMedved is considered one of the fathers of Israel’s startup ecosystem — often called “Startup Nation” after the decades-old best-selling book of the same name. He helped usher it in, having moved from California to Israel in his 20s, then founding and selling several tech companies before turning to investing.  \nIn 2013, he founded OurCrowd. While Israel has many powerful home-grown VC firms, as well as branches of global firms like Bessemer, OurCrowd essentially invented crowdsourced venture capital, where a limited partnership was open to any accredited investor. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s roster attracted LPs from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America, growing a network of 240,000 accredited investor LPs in 195 countries, the firm says. Many of them are doctors, lawyers, and ordinary people who not only help their investment companies, but would have otherwise been cut out of the wealth generation that VCs experience. \nOurCrowd has backed names like Anthropic, Beyond Meat, and Lemonade. \nMedved describes OurCrowd as now a “significant player” backing about 500 portfolio companies with about 74 exits, including an exit a couple of weeks ago when its infrastructure-planning startup Locusview sold for $525 million to Itron. \nDespite Israel’s conflict with Gaza, which has impacted its citizens and put the nation in global crosshairs over the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, its startup ecosystem has remained strong.  \nAs the “startup nation,” Israel remains a key player for cybersecurity and defense tech as well as AI, microchips, enterprise software, food tech, health tech — the whole tech stack. For example, in November, there was “$800 million invested in the Israeli venture ecosystem in one week,” Medved said. The country now has nearly 100 unicorns and over the year, he estimates that between $15 billion and $16 billion was invested in the country in venture deals. \nNow the tech of some of these startups will help him navigate life with an incurable condition. \nFor instance, he’s had an avatar made of himself that preserves his voice, face, and mannerisms. (The photo/video realistic digital twin is pictured and the full video can be seen here.) OurCrowd AI portfolio company D-ID, maker of agents and avatars, partnered with voice AI startup ElevenLabs and other companies through the ALS-focused Scott-Morgan Foundation to create an avatar system designed for people with ALS.\nHe just experienced this tech during a Zoom call with another person who has ALS who was using the avatar to communicate. \n“So this stuff has become very, very personal to me,” Medved said. “It will preserve my voice when it goes.” \nBut he said there will be a variety of startups whose tech he will lean on. \n“We’ve made 60, 70 healthcare investments in good companies that help people. We’ve got a company called OncoHost, which uses AI to help select what kind of immunotherapy will actually work for you. We have companies doing next-generation sequencing for the genome. We have companies doing chronic condition management,” he catalogs. \n“I tell you now as a once-healthy person [who took health for granted] I felt human pain and disease, but once you are actually engaged in one of these nasty diseases, it changes your perspective,” Medved shared.  \nAll of this means that, even though he’s given up his position running the company and may be retiring from the public eye, “I’m far from over, ok? I want to continue to contribute, both to OurCrowd and the overall ecosystem. So I fully intend to not go off [quietly] into this good night.” \nAnd in the end, he says “I’m very proud that in a small way, even though all we are is investors, to be part of this movement.”A video featuring Medved’s “digital twin” demonstrates just how realistic his avatar already is.\n\n\n\n"

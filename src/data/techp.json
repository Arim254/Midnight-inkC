    "body": "\nAfter YouTube discontinued its private messaging feature in 2019, the platform is now reintroducing this functionality for a select group of users. \nUsers with access to the test are able to share videos directly on the mobile app, including long-form videos, Shorts, and even livestreams. \nThey’ll be able to tap the Share button to open a full-screen chat within the app, allowing them to start a private one-on-one conversation or a group chat. Friends can reply with a video of their own, or simply type a response or use emojis.\nThe test is now available to users who are 18 and older in Ireland and Poland, the company says.\nThis is exciting news for many, as currently, the only way to share YouTube videos is through text, email, WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram DMs, or other messaging platforms. The company noted that in-app messaging has been a “top feature request.”\nWhen the messaging feature was first removed, the rationale behind the decision was not fully explained. It was speculated that the feature had become underutilized, a common fate for many features that are eventually discontinued. \nAnother possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior. \nThis concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future.\nYouTube is also implementing standard safety features, including requiring users to send each other invites prior to initiating a chat, as well as the ability to unsend messages, block others, and report conversations.\nYouTube will also review messages to ensure they follow the same Community Guidelines that apply to videos and comments on the platform.\nThe experiment follows a similar feature launched by Spotify in August. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nChatGPT is launching group chats globally to all users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans, OpenAI announced on Thursday. The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. \nThe feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions.\nThe company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options.\nUp to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTo start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo.\nIt’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged.\nOpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience.\n“Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \nThursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1, which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model. In September, OpenAI launched a social app called Sora, where users can generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

In this space, you could let people know what you’re up to or what’s new in your life.\nThe company suggests users could also post something that could serve as a conversation starter, or they could use the space to share why they might not be available to talk at present. \nWhile the addition may be new to many, the company points out in a blog post that this “About” feature, as it’s called, was actually WhatsApp’s first feature. Before WhatsApp focused on secure, private messaging, it allowed people to quickly share short updates like this.\nImage Credits:WhatsApp\nWith the feature’s relaunch, WhatsApp is making users’ “About” status more visible than before. Others will now be able to see your status at the top of their one-on-one chats with friends and users’ profiles. Plus, users can tap on someone’s About status in a chat to reply to it directly. \nLike Instagram Notes, the WhatsApp About status will disappear in a day by default.\nHowever, the company says users can adjust the timer if they want to have it disappear more quickly or stick around longer than 24 hours. Plus, users can decide whether their About status can be seen by just their contacts or if it’s more publicly visible. \nAt launch, the feature is not as robust as Instagram Notes, which also supports short, looping videos and offers integrations that let you share the music you’re streaming.

    "body": "\nKalshi, a prediction market that allows people to bet on future events, has raised a massive $1 billion round at a $11 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the deal. The round comes less than two months after the seven-year-old startup announced its previous fundraise of $300 million at a $5 billion valuation.\nThe latest round is led by the company’s returning investors Sequoia and CapitalG, the person said. Other investors in Kalshi include Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo.\nKalshi and Sequoia declined to comment. CapitalG didn’t respond to our request for comment.\nKalshi’s main rival, Polymarket, was reportedly in talks last month to raise another funding round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, mere weeks after closing a $1 billion round at an $8 billion pre-money valuation, Bloomberg reported.\nKalshi and Polymarket surged in popularity last year after both prediction markets allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election. These betting sites became even more prominent after they correctly predicted the results of New York City’s mayoral election earlier this month.\nFor the Mamdani versus Cuomo race, Kalshi purchased ad space on New York subway cars, running live screens that displayed the up-to-the-minute odds of each candidate winning, a marketing campaign that undoubtedly raised the company’s brand awareness among New Yorkers.\nKalshi allows people in over 140 countries to bet on various future events, ranging from who Time magazine will name Person of the Year for 2025 and the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film Wicked, to outcomes further in the future, like the next U.S. presidential election winner.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn mid-October, the company reached $50 billion in annualized trading volume, marking a more than a thousandfold increase from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year,  the New York Times reported.\nKalshi was co-founded by two former hedge fund traders, Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara. The duo met as undergraduate students at MIT while studying computer science and mathematics.\nPrediction markets have historically been controversial and subject to legal challenges because they operate in the gray area between financial instruments and traditional gambling.\nWhile Kalshi has secured the right for Americans to use its platform after successfully suing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) last year, the company is currently engaged in legal disputes with numerous state regulators who claim its activities are illegal gambling.\nPolymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the CFTC. In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearinghouse. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market. In September, the company’s CEO and founder, Shayne Coplan, said on X: “Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the CFTC.”\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nElectric air taxi developer Joby Aviation is suing Archer Aviation over allegations its rival used stolen trade secrets extracted from a former employee to interfere in its business. \nThe lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer.\nIn the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. \nJoby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole.\n“This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.”\nArcher was quick to strike back. \n“Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.\n“Joby’s case is entirely without merit. The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation,” said Lentell. “As Joby knows, Archer has implemented rigorous employee onboarding procedures to prevent against the very thing it is accused of. Joby is improperly attempting to weaponize the legal system to achieve through bad faith litigation what it cannot accomplish through fair competition. Archer remains focused on building the future of advanced aviation in America.”\nArcher Aviation and Joby are both based in California and went public in 2021 via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. Both are developing electric air taxis as well as pursuing defense applications to its technology.\nFor instance, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril earlier this year to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft for critical defense applications. Meanwhile, Joby signed an agreement with defense contractor L3Harris Technologies to “explore opportunities” to develop a gas-turbine hybrid VTOL aircraft that can fly autonomously.\nThe lawsuit puts the two competitors on a far more combative path.\nArcher has been in the legal hot seat before, although that was ultimately settled. \nWisk, which is now a subsidiary of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021 for “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. Those files included over 50 trade secrets that Wisk alleged were stolen by a former employee who was later hired by Archer. The lawsuit dragged on for two years before the parties settled the legal dispute and agreed to collaborate.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nSilicon Valley folks tend to write off the startup market across the pond as too small or not hungry enough, but that sentiment could not be more different from how Europeans view their potential.\nHelsinki’s annual Slush conference this year showed a venture market that feels like it is on the brink of transformation, one that’s ready for its first trillion-dollar startup.\nFounders, venture investors and government officials alike acknowledged the hurdles that have traditionally held Europe back from reaching its true scale and potential. For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash.\nFirms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since shuttered those shops. OMERs, for example, let much of its European team go. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco.\nLargely, people think the kinks have been worked out: Multiple venture investors told TechCrunch at Slush that the notion of the market being undercapitalized, or that deeper U.S. pockets aren’t interested, is overblown.\nOne investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London.\nEuropean companies are also starting to find success in resisting pressure from U.S. investors to move to the Valley to build their companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVibe coding platform Lovable’s co-founder and CEO, Anton Osika, said during Slush that he credits the company’s rapid growth — $200 million in annual recurring revenue in only a year since launch — to the fact that the startup stayed put in Europe, instead opting to recruiting veteran Silicon Valley talent to Stockholm.\nTaavet Hinrikus, a partner at Plural who was the first hire at Estonia-founded Skype, said at Slush that the European market is about a decade behind the U.S., but startups have gone fully mainstream now in a way they hadn’t 10 years ago.\nAnother VC added that when he originally began investing in startups decades ago, startups and their revenue didn’t account for a noticeable portion of the region’s GDP or revenue, but now things have changed fundamentally, and the share startups hold will continue to grow.\nThe growing number of European success stories like Spotify and Klarna have also buffed up the region’s profile, giving founders the confidence to not exit early. They’ve also given startup employees the skills and financial security to strike out on their own.\nRegulators aren’t sitting by, either, and lately have been trying to make it easier for startups to find success. The EU is moving toward regulation changes that would allow startups to register in all EU countries at once, as opposed to just their native country, next year. Such steps present their own challenges, but the move is a step forward.\nHurdles remain, of course. European enterprises remain less likely than their American counterparts to experiment and implement startup tech. But the vibe at Slush could not be more optimistic. Europe looks ready to come into its own, even if it took a little longer to get there.\nAs Slush’s welcome banner put it: “Still doubting Europe? Go to Hel.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

This season is highlighting lessons learned from the world of go-to-market strategies. Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen sat down with Luna co-founder Jas Schembri-Stothart and Untapped Solutions founder Andre Peart for their unique perspectives on reaching niche customer segments following their own candidacy during the 2024 Startup Battlefield competition.\nIf our first episode, with Deon Nicholas, co-founder of Forethought AI, we explored what it takes to create a company with a customer-first approach. And in our second episode, we’re diving into guerrilla tactics and experiments that worked in reaching two very different target audiences: teenage girls and formerly incarcerated workers. \n\n\n\nFor Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse.\nUntapped Solutions had a different challenge. As the “LinkedIn for the formerly incarcerated,” Peart had to find a way to make sure that the platform could actually be deployed into the many places where currently or formerly incarcerated individuals could access it in order to help them attain employment. And to do that, in a space largely untouched by tech solutions, they hit the speaking circuit hard, and even began their own National Reentry Coalition and their own event, which kicked off this April. That, alongside partnerships with agencies working with the 600,000 people released from prison annually, has led to an increasing ubiquity. \n“We’re in almost every prison system,” Peart said. “So if you’re on a tablet, you already have Untapped.” \nFor the full episode’s worth of insights, check out the video above, or listen and subscribe to Build Mode wherever you like getting your favorite podcasts.

    "description": "Two Trump-appointed FCC officials voted to undo the telecom industry's cybersecurity rules. One Democratic commissioner dissented, saying the decision leaves the United States \"less safe\" at a time when threats are increasing.",
    "body": "\nThe Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 along party lines on Thursday to scrap rules that required U.S. phone and internet giants to meet certain minimum cybersecurity requirements.\nThe FCC’s two Trump-appointed commissioners, chairman Brendan Carr and his Republican colleague Olivia Trusty, voted to withdraw the rules that require telecommunications carriers to “secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.” The Biden administration had adopted these rules prior to leaving office earlier this year.\nThe FCC’s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, dissented. In a statement following the vote, Gomez called the now-overturned rules the “only meaningful effort this agency has advanced” since the discovery of a sweeping campaign by a China-backed hacking group called Salt Typhoon that involved hacking into a raft of U.S. phone and internet companies.\nThe hackers broke into more than 200 telcos, including AT&T, Verizon and Lumen, during the years-long campaign to conduct broad-scale surveillance of American officials. In some cases, the hackers targeted wiretap systems that the U.S. government previously required telcos to install for law enforcement access.\nThe FCC’s move to change the rules sparked rebuke from senior lawmakers, including Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Peters said he was “disturbed” by the FCC’s effort to roll back “basic cybersecurity safeguards” and warned that doing so will “leave the American people exposed.”\nSen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the rule change “leaves us without a credible plan” to address the basic security gaps exploited by Salt Typhoon and others.\nFor its part, the NCTA, which represents the telecommunications industry, praised the scrapping of the rules, calling them “prescriptive and counterproductive regulations.”\nBut Gomez warned that while collaboration with the telecommunications industry is valuable for cybersecurity, it is insufficient without enforcement.\n“Handshake agreements without teeth will not stop state-sponsored hackers in their quest to infiltrate our networks,” said Gomez. “They won’t prevent the next breach. They do not ensure that the weakest link in the chain is strengthened. If voluntary cooperation were enough, we would not be sitting here today in the wake of Salt Typhoon.”\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSalesforce said on Wednesday that it’s investigating a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” that was compromised through apps published by Gainsight, a company that sells a platform for other companies to manage their customers. \nIn a notice published late Wednesday, Salesforce said the hacks involve “Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce, which are installed and managed directly by customers.” \nSalesforce said that there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” and that the activity appears related to Gainsight’s “external connection to Salesforce.”\nWhen reached for comment, Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda referred TechCrunch to the company’s page dedicated to the incident. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nAs of this writing, Gainsight said in a status page that it is investigating a “Salesforce connection issue,” without making any reference to a potential breach. “Our internal investigation is ongoing,” Gainsight wrote.\nA spokesperson for Gainsight did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nOn its website, Gainsight touts several corporate customers, including Airtable, Notion, GitLab, and others. When reached by email, GitLab spokesperson Emily James told TechCrunch that GitLab’s “security team is investigating and we’ll get back to you when we have more to share.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe prolific hacking group ShinyHunters told cybersecurity news website DataBreaches.net that it was behind the breach, adding that if Salesforce doesn’t negotiate with them, they will create a new website to advertise the stolen data — a common extortion tactic by financially-motivated cybercriminals. \n“The next [data leak site] will contain the data of the Salesloft and GainSight campaigns,” the hackers told DataBreaches.net. The hackers claim to have stolen data from close to a thousand companies.\nThis data breach appears similar to an August breach at AI marketing chatbot maker Salesloft, which allowed the hackers to break into a number of their customers’ connected Salesforce instances to steal sensitive data, such as access tokens for other services. Among the victims included insurance giant Allianz Life, Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, fashion conglomerate Kering, Proofpoint, the airline Qantas, carmaker Stellantis, credit bureau TransUnion, the employee management platform Workday, and others. \nIn the case of the Salesloft breaches, the hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which apparently includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility. \nLast month, the hackers launched a dedicated website to extort the victims of the breaches, where they threatened to release a billion records. \nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of the Salesloft-linked breaches, but it’s unclear if this new wave of hacks originated from its earlier compromise.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nSpaceX rolled out an upgraded version of its Starship rocket booster in South Texas on Thursday to begin testing, and just a few hours later, something inside it exploded.\nLive streamers who watch SpaceX’s Starbase complex closely caught the explosion in the pre-dawn hours Friday, around 4:00 a.m. local time. Other creators in the area have since captured photos that offer a closer look at the damage. \nUnlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, according to Ars Technica.\nSpaceX said in a post on X that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. \n“The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday.\nThe booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the Moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design in October.)\nIt’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship. That includes demonstrating the ability to transfer fuel to Starship from a “tanker” version of the rocket while in orbit. SpaceX needs to prove that capability to NASA before it can proceed with crewed missions to the Moon, which it is reportedly targeting for 2028. \nActing NASA administrator Sean Duffy has already criticized SpaceX for not moving quickly enough on its Moon-mission progress, and has said he may want to give Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin a chance to take the contract instead. \nBlue Origin is picking up the pace on developing its own mega-rocket. Just last week, the company launched its New Glenn rocket for the second time and delivered its first commercial payload for NASA. The company also landed its first New Glenn rocket booster. On Thursday, the company revealed an even larger design for New Glenn that will more directly compete with Starship.\nThis story has been updated with new information from SpaceX.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nJust weeks before Australia’s social media ban for users under 16 takes effect, the country’s watchdog, eSafety, has added Twitch to the list of banned platforms.\nPinterest, however, was excluded, in line with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) rules.\nTwitch will no longer allow Australians under 16 to create accounts starting December 10, a Twitch spokesperson told TechCrunch. Existing accounts for users under 16 will be deactivated on January 9. Globally, Twitch is open to users 13 and older, and anyone under the legal age of adulthood in their region must have a parent or guardian involved, the spokesperson said.\nPinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAustralia’s eSafety stated that Twitch is categorized as an “age-restricted social media platform” because the service is built around online social interaction and engagement features like live-streaming. Pinterest, on the other hand, is mainly used for collecting images and ideas, so it isn’t included in the age-restricted rules.\nAustralia has said its underage social media ban, which will go into effect on December 10, will apply to Meta‘s Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, YouTube (except YouTube Kids and Google Classroom), Reddit, and the local streaming service, Kick. These platforms will be required to block account access for users under 16, according to a statement by the internet regulator. \nAbout a year ago, Australia passed a law banning social media use for children under 16. At the time, major tech companies like Google and Meta called on the government to delay enforcement until the country finished its age-verification trial. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe regulator provides a self-assessment tool to help platforms determine if they must follow the SMMA rules. \nOther countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., are taking similar steps to control who sees what content on the Internet, though their approaches differ. Twenty-four U.S. states have so far enacted age-verification laws as of August 2025. Utah became the first to require app stores to verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for minors downloading apps. \nThe U.K.’s Online Safety Act came into effect in July, mandating social media and other online platforms to block children’s access to harmful content or face huge fines. The U.K. requires strong age checks for high-risk content, like self-harm and eating disorder content, to protect users under 18.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nGoogle is bringing more AI muscle to India’s fight against digital fraud, rolling out on-device scam detection for Pixel 9 devices and new screen-sharing alerts for financial apps.\nDigital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly $789 million) in losses in the first five months of 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Many incidents likely go unreported, either because victims are unsure how to file a complaint or wish to avoid additional scrutiny.\nOn Thursday, Google announced the expansion of its real-time scam-detection feature, which uses Gemini Nano to analyze calls on-device and flag potential fraud without recording audio or sending data to Google’s servers. The feature is off by default and applies only to calls from unknown numbers, and it plays a beep during the conversation to notify participants. It debuted in the U.S. in March as a beta for English-speaking Pixel 9 users.\nGoogle confirmed to TechCrunch that its on-device scam detection will initially work only on Pixel 9 and later models in India and will be limited to English-speaking users, with its warning also English only. That restricts its reach in a market where Android accounts for nearly 96% of smartphones, per Statcounter, but Pixel devices held less than 1% share in 2024. The language limitation is also notable in a country where most users primarily rely on non-English languages — an audience that Google and others like Amazon have acknowledged by adding support for Indian languages across their services in recent years.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe tech giant did say it was working to bring scam detection to non-Pixel Android phones, as well, without offering a timeline.\nGoogle also announced a pilot in India with financial apps Navi, Paytm, and Google Pay aimed at limiting screen-sharing scams, in which fraudsters persuade victims to share their screens to obtain one-time passwords, PINs, and other credentials during a call. The feature was first announced at Google I/O in May and initially tested in the U.K.\nUsers with devices running Android 11 or later will be able to access the alerts, which include a one-tap option to end the call and stop screen sharing. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it plans to add more app partners and the feature will display alerts in Indian languages as well but did not provide details.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor several months, Google has also been using its Play Protect service to restrict predatory loan apps in India by blocking the sideloading of third-party apps that request sensitive permissions often exploited for fraud. The company said the service blocked more than 115 million such installation attempts this year. Google Pay, meanwhile, surfaces more than a million warnings each week for transactions flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to the company.\nGoogle is also running its DigiKavach awareness campaign on digital fraud, which it said has reached more than 250 million people. The company has worked with the Reserve Bank of India to publish a public list of authorized digital lending apps and their associated non-banking financial companies to help limit malicious actors.\nEarlier this year, Google launched a Safety Charter in India to expand its AI-driven fraud detection and security efforts, part of a broader plan to deploy more AI tools in the country to address rising fraud.\nYet Google still faces significant gaps in curbing digital fraud in India. The company — like Apple — has been questioned for allowing fake and misleading apps to appear on its app store despite review processes meant to block fraudulent submissions.\nIn recent years, police and security researchers have flagged investment and loan apps used in scams that remained available on the Play Store until intervention. These cases underscore the challenges Google faces in policing an ecosystem that dominates the country’s smartphone market.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe ex-Googler team behind the 3D design app Rooms from Things, Inc. is out with its latest project: a playful AI photo editor called Mixup. The iOS-only app lets anyone create new AI-generated photos using “recipes,” which are like Mad Lib-style, fill-in-the-blank prompts for your photos, texts, or sketches.\nFor instance, you could ask Mixup to turn your scribbled sketch into a beautiful Renaissance painting, or to reimagine your pet in a funny Halloween costume. You could use a selfie to see what you’d look like with a different hairstyle, or create something even sillier — like envisioning a friend transformed into the form of Italian brainrot.\nImage Credits:Mixup\nThe app is built on top of Google’s Nano Banana, but the “recipe” format opens up a new way to interact with the model — turning a generative tool into an online party game.\n“The thing that [Nano Banana] did that no model did before was that it could take your image and maintain it in a convincing way that wasn’t creepy,” said Things, Inc. founder and CEO Jason Toff, whose background includes working on experimental apps inside Big Tech companies like Google and Meta, as well as time spent managing product at Twitter.\nBut what makes Mixup particularly fun to use is that the app’s “recipes” — the user-generated AI prompts — are shareable.\nImage Credits:Mixup\n“Generative AI is so powerful, and yet most of the time you go to these tools and it’s like, here’s your text box — come up with something creative. And what do you write?” Toff said, speaking to the shortcomings his team saw with the current AI landscape.\n“And so, rather than having to be creative and think about what to create, you see something that worked, and you can just fill in the blanks,” he said.\nImage Credits:Mixup\nAfter users create a new prompt in Mixup, they can choose to publish it along with the resulting photo to a public feed or just download it for personal use. From the feed, other users can view the photo and tap the button next to it to “Try recipe.” This allows anyone on the app to reuse the recipe to generate an image using their own photo, text, or doodles. (The latter can be made via a simple, in-app drawing feature.) \nSeeing a photo alongside the recipe that created it can also help address the unpredictable nature of generative AI images, the team believes.\n“Another problem [with generative AI] is what we were referring to internally as a ‘slot machine’ problem, where you push the button, something comes out, you push it again, something different comes out, and you don’t feel like you have control over the output,” Toff explained. \nImage Credits:Mixup\nIn Mixup, however, users can see both the photo and the prompt that created it in one place, giving them an idea of what their output would look like. They can also toggle a button to see both the before and after image, if the creator opts to leave this setting on.\nPlus, similar to OpenAI’s AI video app Sora, users can upload their own photos to Mixup to use in their AI images. If you choose to do so, then any person you follow in the app can also create AI images with your likeness — a feature it calls “mixables.” \nThe company imagines that groups of friends would follow each other to take advantage of the feature, but a creator class could also potentially emerge on the platform — if they don’t mind seeing themselves mashed up in bizarre ways. (Of course, if you don’t want your image out there, either don’t upload it or don’t follow anyone.)\nImage Credits:Mixup\nThe app also uses OpenAI technology to handle some of the expected moderation concerns around AI imagery, but Toff admits that Mixup also leans heavily on Google’s built-in controls within its image model to restrict things like sexual content or violence. \nAt launch, Mixup is optimized for iOS 26 but is supported on iOS 18 and up. If it takes off, a web version or Android app may be added later.\nFree users receive 100 credits, which equates to $4. Meanwhile, images cost nearly 4 cents to produce. When the credits run out, users can subscribe to different tiers offering 100, 250, or 500 credits per month.\nThe app launches at midnight on November 21 on the App Store globally, but will require an invite to get in. TechCrunch readers can use the code TCHCRH (until it runs out) to get in. Mixup is available for preorder ahead of its launch.\n\n\n\nThis post was updated after publication to note the app launches Nov. 21, not Nov. 20 as previously stated. \n"

The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices.\nGoogle plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. \nThe company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses.\nQuick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share.\n“This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a blog post.\nThe tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen.\nGoogle notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well.

    "body": "\nAI search company Perplexity launched its Comet browser today on Android. The startup debuted the AI-centric browser in July on desktop with AI-powered search.\nThe company is bringing most of the desktop version’s capabilities to Android. People can use Perplexity as the default search engine, and they can also mention tabs to ask questions to the assistant. They can also use the voice mode to ask questions about all open tabs. Plus, the assistant can summarize searches across all tabs.\nPerplexity said the browser can research and shop on your behalf as well, and you can look at what action the Comet assistant is taking. What’s more, the Android version has an in-built ad blocker.\nImage Credits:Perplexity\nThe company said in the coming weeks it aims to add new features to the app, including a conversational agent that can search across sites and take actions, creating shortcuts for the assistant to take quick actions, and a fully functional password manager in coming weeks.\nEarlier this month, the startup updated its Comet Assistant on desktop to efficiently perform more complex tasks that run for longer, like shifting data from a website to a spreadsheet.\nWhile Perplexity has chosen to launch on Android, the company said it will also come to iOS soon. The company noted that Android has been a priority because of the volume of carriers and OEMs that have asked the startup to include Comet on their devices and solutions. However, there was no partnership announcement from Perplexity.\nEarlier this year, the startup partnered with Motorola to preload the app on the company’s devices. But Perplexity didn’t specify if the agreement would extend to pre-installing the new Comet browser as well. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAI browsers have been a space of interest for many companies. Apart from Perplexity, OpenAI, Opera, and The Browser Company — which is now owned by Atlassian — have launched their AI browsers. However, they have largely been desktop releases. The Browser Company released Arc Search for mobile last year, but there haven’t been significant updates to the app. Late last year, the company shifted its focus to a new browser called Dia, which doesn’t have a mobile version yet.\nThese companies have been trying hard to replace incumbents like Chrome and Safari with AI-powered browsers. But security experts have raised questions around vulnerabilities in agents that could pose a security risk. In October, Perplexity wrote a blog acknowledging these risks and saying that some of the new paradigms around attacks aided by AI would require rethinking security from the ground up.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

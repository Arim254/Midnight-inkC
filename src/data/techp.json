    "body": "\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is finally ready to try a second launch of its super heavy-lift rocket New Glenn. The company announced on Wednesday that it will attempt the launch as early as Sunday, November 9, from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nNew Glenn’s first flight took place back in January, and it was mostly successful. The rocket’s second stage made it into orbit, but the first stage exploded on its return to Earth before Blue Origin could attempt to land it on a drone ship in the ocean.\nEarlier this year, the company said it would try to launch New Glenn for a second time in “late spring.” That timeline slipped a few times, though. Blue Origin is being extra careful with the second launch in part because it will be carrying cargo on behalf of paying customers this time. The main cargo is NASA’s twin ESCAPADE spacecraft, which are headed to Mars. A Viasat tech demonstrator will also be on board.\n"

For context, the current cloud-based version of Apple Intelligence uses 150 billion parameters, meaning Google’s model would be roughly eight times more complex.\nApple had also considered using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic earlier this year. After testing models from all three companies, Apple chose to move forward with Google.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the overhauled Siri is expected to launch next spring. However, since the launch is still months away, plans for the revamp could change.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nLucid Motors’ chief engineer Eric Bach is leaving the company after more than a decade, the company has announced.\nBach, who also served as Lucid Motors’ Senior Vice President of Product, has been with the company since 2015. He joined Lucid after spending three years as Tesla’s Director of Engineering, where he worked alongside Lucid Motors’ former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. Bach spent more than 10 years at Volkswagen before Tesla.\nTechCrunch has learned that Lucid’s VP of Engineering, James Hawkins, is also no longer with the company after spending 10 years there. Lucid Motors declined to specifically comment on his departure.  \nBach’s and Hawkins’ departures are part of a wider shake-up announced Wednesday. Lucid Motors’ Vice President of Quality, Jeri Ford, is retiring as well. She will be replaced by Marnie Levergood, who is coming to the company from Scout Motors.\nAt the same time, Lucid Motors’ current Senior Vice President of Powertrain, Emad Dlala, is being elevated to oversee all of “Engineering and Digital.” Dlala was promoted once already earlier this year and has been with the company since 2015.\nThe executive shake-up comes as Lucid enters its ninth month without a permanent CEO after Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February. Former chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff has been serving as CEO on an interim basis ever since.\nThe loss of Bach and Ford is the latest in a line of executive departures at Lucid Motors. The company’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing have all left within the last year.\nThe changes are happening at a critical moment in Lucid Motors’ history. The company finally launched its long-awaited luxury SUV, the Gravity, which the company expects will ultimately be more successful than the Air sedan, which it has struggled to sell. \nLucid Motors is also working on a midsized vehicle that will be priced closer to $50,000 in 2026, though it has said it likely needs to raise more money before that happens. On Wednesday, Lucid Motors announced that its majority owner — Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund — had boosted the cap of a loan agreement from $750 million to around $2 billion, which provides the company liquidity until 2027.\nThis story has been updated with more information about departures and the amended loan agreement announced Wednesday.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nDiscord has rolled out updates to its Family Center, giving guardians more insights into their teens’ usage patterns, including purchases, top interactions, and time spent. The goal is to help parents monitor whether their teen is spending excessive time or money on Discord.\nThe communication platform first launched Family Center in 2023 with an activity dashboard showing which servers their teens have joined and a weekly email summary for guardians about their teen’s activity. The platform is now expanding these monitoring abilities.\nGuardians can now see total purchases made by the teen in the last week, including items from Discord’s Shop and Nitro subscriptions (Discord’s premium membership service).\nImage Credits: Discord\nThey can also view the total time spent on voice and video calls in DMs, groups, and servers over the past week. Plus, Discord will display the top five users and servers teens interacted with in the last seven days. This comes after other social networks Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat have also implemented restrictions on who can contact teens.\nDiscord is also adding new parental controls to the app with settings that can only be altered by guardians. They can now control who can DM their teen and whether sensitive content should be filtered. Guardians can also manage data privacy controls for teens, determining how Discord uses their data, including whether to show them personalized ads.\nImage Credits: Discord\nThe company also said that when teens report content on the platform, they now have an option to notify their parents or guardians of their action. However, Discord said it won’t disclose what content was reported and encourages teens to discuss this directly with their guardians instead.\n“The new features allow guardians who have linked Family Center accounts to play a more active role in creating a safer space online for teens while still respecting their privacy,” Discord said in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, several companies, including Meta, YouTube, and OpenAI, have rolled out updates to bolster their tools around teen safety.

    "body": "\nTinder is looking to AI to revitalize its dating app, which has now reported nine straight quarters of paying subscriber declines, as of the third quarter this year. The dating app maker, Match Group, told investors on Tuesday’s earnings call that Tinder is testing a feature called Chemistry that will get to know users through questions and, with permission, will access Camera Roll photos on users’ phones to learn more about their interests and personality.\nThe feature is already being piloted in New Zealand and Australia and will be a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience,” said Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff.\nMatch isn’t alone in requesting access to users’ private Camera Roll photos. Meta also launched a feature last month that asks to use its AI on photos on your phone that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\nIn both cases, the benefits to the end user for permitting this kind of expanded access are negligible. \nIn Match’s case, the company says it will engage users with interactive questions and learn more about them using AI technology so it can recommend better, more compatible matches. Presumably, that would look something like this: If you had photos of yourself outside hiking or climbing, you might be matched with someone who shared the same outdoor hobbies.\nWhile the company experiments with Tinder, Match’s bottom line is taking a hit. \nIts fourth-quarter guidance includes a $14 million negative impact on Tinder’s direct revenue as a result of the product testing, Match said. This, alongside other dating industry trends, has pulled down Match’s Q4 guidance to land somewhere between $865 million and $875 million, while analysts were expecting $884.2 million. \nThe company is using AI in other areas as well, including in an LLM-powered system where Tinder nudges users before they send potentially offensive messages, asking them, “Are you sure?” It also uses AI to help users pick their best photos.\nAI isn’t the only thing Tinder is trying to boost subscribers and engagement. The company has rolled out other features, like dating “modes,” double dates, facial verification, and redesigned profiles, which feature bio information on the first photo card and prompts integrated into the photo carousel.\nDespite the product changes, Tinder faces a tough market where some young people are leaning away from online dating in favor of more real-world experiences, while online daters in the U.S. may be spending less due to their disposable income shrinking as the country flirts with recession.\nMatch reported in Q3 that Tinder’s revenue declined 3% year-over-year, and it saw a 7% decline in paying users. \nOverall, Match’s revenue and earnings were largely in line with estimates, with revenue up 2% to $914.2 million, versus an expected $915 million, and EPS of 62 cents (profit of $160.8 million), versus an expected 63 cents.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, researchers at Microsoft released a new simulation environment designed to test AI agents, along with new research showing that current agentic models may be vulnerable to manipulation. Conducted in collaboration with Arizona State University, the research raises new questions about how well AI agents will perform when working unsupervised — and how quickly AI companies can make good on promises of an agentic future.\nThe simulation environment, dubbed the “Magentic Marketplace” by Microsoft, is built as a synthetic platform for experimenting on AI agent behavior. A typical experiment might involve a customer-agent trying to order dinner according to a user’s instructions, while agents representing various restaurants compete to win the order.\nThe team’s initial experiments included 100 separate customer-side agents interacting with 300 business-side agents. Because the source code for the marketplace is open source, it should be straightforward for other groups to adopt the code to run new experiments or reproduce findings.\nEce Kamar, managing director of Microsoft Research’s AI Frontiers Lab, says this kind of research will be critical to understanding the capabilities of AI agents. “There is really a question about how the world is going to change by having these agents collaborating and talking to each other and negotiating,” said Kamar. “We want to understand these things deeply.”\nThe initial research looked at a mix of leading models, including GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and found some surprising weaknesses. In particular, the researchers found several techniques businesses could use to manipulate customer agents into buying their products. The researchers noticed a particular falloff in efficiency as a customer agent was given more options to choose from, overwhelming the attention space of the agent.\n“We want these agents to help us with processing a lot of options,” Kamar says. “And we are seeing that the current models are actually getting really overwhelmed by having too many options.”\nThe agents also ran into trouble when they were asked to collaborate toward a common goal, apparently unsure of which agent should play what role in the collaboration. Performance improved when the models were given more explicit instructions on how to collaborate, but the researchers still saw the models’ inherent capabilities as in need of improvement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We can instruct the models — like we can tell them, step by step,” Kamar said. “But if we are inherently testing their collaboration capabilities, I would expect these models to have these capabilities by default.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Only, it’s a circle of profit that ensures the money eventually comes back to their own coffers.\nCase in point: SoftBank, which is investing tens of billions into OpenAI and committing dozens more to build AI data centers and infrastructure, just launched a joint venture with the ChatGPT maker in Japan that will localize and sell the AI company’s enterprise tech to companies in the country. And the first customer of this joint venture is going to be SoftBank itself.\nCalled SB OAI Japan, the joint venture will be owned 50-50 by SoftBank and OpenAI and will provide what the companies are calling “Crystal intelligence,” which is being defined as a “packaged enterprise AI solution” targeted at corporate management and operations in Japan.\n“Crystal intelligence is designed to help organizations enhance productivity and management efficiency through the adoption of advanced AI tools. The solution combines OpenAI’s enterprise offerings with localized implementation and support provided through SB OAI Japan,” SoftBank said in a statement.\nIt seems SoftBank is intent on fueling the AI hype cycle and the resultant revenues: The conglomerate said all its employees are “actively utilizing AI in their daily operations,” and that it has so far created 2.5 million custom ChatGPT instances for internal use.\nThe conglomerate said it would put the joint venture’s solutions to use throughout its various businesses, validate their effectiveness for product development and “business transformation,” and then pass on the insights and expertise it gains to other companies back through SB OAI Japan.\nThe joint venture comes as analysts raise concerns about the truckloads of cash being thrown at AI development and associated efforts, as well as the stratospheric valuations awarded to companies benefiting from it. The movement is being likened to the dot-com boom, when the widespread adoption of the internet resulted in a wave of venture capital and sky-high valuations, and similar booms over the past couple of decades where massive sums were spent on developing unproven business models without a clear sign of meaningful returns on investment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nOn an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down as it expands the use cases for visual AI.\nThe image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers’ first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant. \nHowever, investors wanted to know what Pinterest’s opportunity in agentic commerce — AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users — was given the rapidly changing AI landscape and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential.\nThat question has become more pressing. During the company’s third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a weaker holiday shopping season than expected, citing President Donald Trump’s tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. As a result, Pinterest’s fourth-quarter revenue is expected to come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.34 billion, on average. The news sent the stock tumbling by more than 21% on Wednesday.\nDespite the near-term revenue concerns, Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. In addition to its own proprietary models that are already accounted for in its cost structure, Ready said the company tests leading off-the-shelf models against open source options on a regular basis and found the open source models promising.\n“One of the really, really interesting things that we’re seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,” Ready told investors. “Given current market rates and per token costs, in early testing, we’re seeing orders of magnitude reduction in cost with comparable performance using fine-tuned open source models versus leading off-the-shelf proprietary models.” \nHe said the company planned to move forward with many open source models for its various use cases, which would come at “a fraction of the cost” of the larger model providers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We feel really good about the value that we’re bringing to the user there, our ability to align that with monetization, and our ability to control those costs and deliver that effectively,” said Ready.\nThe exec also touched on other areas where Pinterest is considering how to best use AI, including agentic shopping. Ready said that Pinterest already offers “push-button type buying” via its Amazon partnership, and it will wait to see if users actually want the AI to “push the button for them.”\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nIn the meantime, Ready suggested that Pinterest’s biggest differentiator is that it guides the user through the shopping experience — something it hopes to improve with Pinterest Assistant, an AI companion users can talk to, asking for advice and recommendations. The assistant understands the user based on their boards, collages, saves, and how they compare to people with similar tastes, the company says.\nPinterest is also rolling out personalized boards curated with AI, which Ready said combine expert human curation and AI. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhen Nvidia announced its Rubin series of GPUs in March, it also dropped a bomb: Racks built with the Ultra version of the chip, which is expected to be released in 2027, could draw up to 600 kilowatts of electricity. That’s nearly twice as much juice as some of the fastest EV chargers can deliver today.\nAs data center racks become that power hungry, one of the biggest hurdles will be figuring out how to keep them cool. One startup thinks stacks of metal are the answer.\nAlloy Enterprises has developed a technology that turns sheets of copper into solid cooling plates for GPUs and for peripheral chips, the supporting components like memory and networking hardware that account for about 20% of a server’s cooling load. \n“We didn’t care too much about that 20% when racks were 120 kilowatts,” Ali Forsyth, co-founder and CEO of Alloy Enterprises, told TechCrunch. But now, as racks have hit 480 kilowatts on their way to 600 kilowatts, engineers have to figure out how to liquid cool everything from RAM to networking chips, parts for which there are no solutions available today.\nAlloy’s approach uses additive manufacturing (building objects layer by layer) to produce cold plates that are capable of squeezing into tight spots while withstanding the high pressures that liquid cooling can demand.\nImage Credits:Alloy Enterprises\nBut the startup doesn’t use 3D printing. Rather, it takes sheets of metal and forces them to bond using a combination of heat and pressure. It’s more expensive than traditional machining, but cheaper than 3D printing.\nThe result is a cold plate that, for all intents and purposes, is a single block of metal. There’s no seam, unlike machined products, and it’s solid metal, unlike 3D-printed versions, which can be porous. “We hit raw material properties,” Forsyth said. “The copper is just as strong as if you had machined it.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost cold plates are machined, a process that uses tools to carve out features. Because the tools are large, each half of the plate has to be machined separately. The two halves are then sintered together — a process that fuses metal powders using heat — which introduces a seam that could potentially leak under high pressure. Alloy’s process, a type of diffusion bonding it calls “stack forging,” makes seamless cold plates. \nStack forging can also make smaller features, down to 50 microns, about half the width of a human hair, allowing more coolant to flow past the metal. Alloy’s cold plates have 35% better thermal performance than competitors, Forsyth said.\nBecause of the complexities of stack forging, Alloy does most of the internal design. Customers submit key specifications and dimensions, and the startup’s software helps translate those into a shape that works for the company’s manufacturing process.\nIn Alloy’s factory, rolls of copper are first prepped and cut to size. The features are then cut out using a laser. Parts of the design that the company doesn’t want to bond to each other are coated with an inhibitor. When completed, each slice of a cold plate is registered and stacked before heading into a diffusion bonding machine, which uses heat and pressure to press the stacked slices into a single piece of metal.\nForsyth said her company is working with “all the big names” in the data center world, though she wouldn’t disclose specifics. \nInitially, the company had designed the technology to work with a widely used aluminum alloy, but as it received more interest from data centers, it ported the process to work with copper, which conducts heat well and resists corrosion. When Alloy announced the product in June, “things just blew up,” Forsyth said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe University of Pennsylvania confirmed on Tuesday that a hacker stole university data as part of last week’s data breach, during which alumni and other affiliates received suspicious emails from official university email addresses.\n“We got hacked,” the message from the hackers read. “We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked),” the message added. “Please stop giving us money.”\nWhile Penn initially told TechCrunch that the email was “fraudulent,” the university has now confirmed the hacker’s claim that data was taken during the breach.\n“On October 31, Penn discovered that a select group of information systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities had been compromised,” the university wrote in a statement, which was emailed to alumni and shared online. “Penn’s staff rapidly locked down the systems and prevented further unauthorized access; however, not before an offensive and fraudulent email was sent to our community and information was taken by the attacker.”\n(Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, the hackers sent the message to my personal email three times, each coming from different official @upenn.edu email addresses, including one from a senior Penn staff member.)\nA partially redacted email sent by hackers from a university of Pennsylvania email address.Image Credits:TechCrunch (Screenshot)\nThe university said that the breach occurred due to a social engineering attack, a hacking technique in which individuals are tricked into handing over sensitive information like log-in credentials, perhaps through phishing or a phone call.\nA Penn employee, who we are not naming, as they were not authorized to speak to the press, told TechCrunch that the university requires students, staff, and alumni to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts as a security measure; however, the employee said that some high-ranking officials were granted exemptions to MFA requirements.\nTechCrunch asked Penn about these alleged MFA exceptions, and if the university could provide a percentage of MFA adoption among staff. Penn spokesperson Ron Ozio declined to comment to TechCrunch beyond Penn’s official data incident page.\nAs required by law, Penn said it will contact individuals whose personal information was accessed by hackers. The university has not said when these notifications will occur, how many people are affected, or what information was accessed.\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian reports that the alleged Penn hacker claimed to have taken documents relating to university donors, bank transaction receipts, and personally identifiable information. The hacker said they were financially motivated.\nEarlier this year, hackers breached Columbia University, accessing sensitive information about around 870,000 students and applicants, including their Social Security numbers and citizenship status.\nBoth the Penn and Columbia hacks appear motivated by discontent with affirmative action policies. In the email that the Penn hacker sent to the university community, the hacker wrote, “We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits.” Meanwhile, the Columbia hacker told Bloomberg that they sought to access data from the university to investigate its affirmative action practices.\nIf you have more information about the Penn hack, you can contact Amanda Silberling securely on Signal at @amanda.100, or by email, from a non-work device.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is calling Google’s proposal in its antitrust settlement with the Fortnite maker a “comprehensive solution” that “genuinely doubles down” on Android’s vision of being an open platform.\nThe companies on Tuesday reached a settlement that sees the search giant agreeing to Android app store reforms that include lowering fees and enabling more competition.\nUnder the new proposal, which still requires the judge’s approval, Google will allow Android app developers to point users to alternative payment mechanisms inside their apps and through external web links. It also caps the fees Google is able to charge developers at either 9% or 20%, depending on the type of transaction and the date on which the app was installed.\nIn a post on X, Sameer Samat, president of the Android Ecosystem at Google, wrote that the company’s proposed changes “focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe.” If approved by the court, the deal would put an end to the antitrust litigation.\nSweeney praised the proposal, calling it “awesome,” and contrasted it with Apple’s model, which he said was focused on “blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition.” \nApple has argued its policies are about protecting consumers and managing App Store security. That said, the iPhone maker recently reported record revenue for its Services business, which includes the App Store — the segment’s revenue rose 15% to $28.75 billion in the last quarter from a year earlier.\nEpic Games had sued both Google and Apple, accusing their respective app store ecosystems of being anti-competitive, and alleging the companies have too much control, charge excessive fees, and favor their own in-app payment systems. Apple largely won its case with Epic but had to modify its App Store rules to allow for alternative payment options. Google, however, lost its appeal in July after a jury found that the search giant had stifled competition and needed to make changes.\nAfter the win, Sweeney announced that the Epic Games Store for Android would be coming to the Google Play Store.\nUpdated after publication to note that the fees also depend on the date of app installation, per the filing. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

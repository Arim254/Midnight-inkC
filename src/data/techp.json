Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI.\nLast year, Meta announced that its Meta AI would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice.\nElevenLabs also announced this week that it was launching a marketplace to let brands use authorized AI-generated voices of celebrities, which will include Caine and other names like Liza Minnelli and Dr. Maya Angelou. ElevenLabs is one of the more popular AI unicorn companies and has backers including a16z and ICONIQ.  \n\n\tTopics\n"

    "body": "\nMicrosoft is taking a page from OpenAI’s playbook, literally. Bloomberg first reported that the tech giant plans to leverage its partner’s custom chip development to bolster its own struggling semiconductor efforts, a move that looks increasingly pragmatic given Microsoft’s lackluster performance compared to rivals like Google and Amazon.\nThe arrangement is straightforward: OpenAI is designing AI chips with Broadcom, and Microsoft gets full access to the innovations. “As they innovate even at the system level, we get access to all of it,” CEO Satya Nadella explained on a newly released interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, describing plans to adopt OpenAI’s designs and then extend them for Microsoft’s own purposes.\nUnder a revised partnership agreement, Microsoft secured intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s chip designs while maintaining access to the company’s AI models through 2032. The only carve-out? OpenAI’s consumer hardware, which the ChatGPT maker presumably wants to develop and sell independently.\nThe collaboration underscores a broader reality in tech: building cutting-edge AI chips is brutally difficult and expensive. Rather than continuing to struggle alone, Microsoft is betting that OpenAI’s expertise — plus a smartly structured contract — can accelerate its own ambitions.\n"

The acquirer is the music and technology company Stingray Group, which will pay $150 million at closing and up to $25 million one year later.\nIt financed the deal with a loan under its renewed credit facility, the company said on Wednesday.\nFounded in 2002, TuneIn was an early player in the online music space. Unlike rivals such as Apple Music or Spotify Premium that offer ad-free, subscription-based music on demand, TuneIn focused on streaming traditional radio stations over the internet. This business model also allowed TuneIn to deliver a wide variety of content beyond music, like news, talk, and live sports. The company attempted to monetize this content through a paid subscription that also included audiobooks and ad-free radio channels.\nHowever, the company struggled to compete in the crowded streaming market, particularly as consumer demand for talk radio shifted to podcasts, and people grew comfortable paying for ad-free music subscriptions.\nStingray, a Montreal-based company that owns radio stations and provides music tech and advertising services, acquired TuneIn to expand its reach, particularly through partnerships with device manufacturers, automakers, and content providers. The company noted that TuneIn’s content is available on more than 200 platforms and connected devices, including over 50 in-car audio systems, spanning more than 100 countries.\nThe $175 million purchase price was based on TuneIn’s forecasted sales of $110 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025. TuneIn has over 75 million monthly active listeners worldwide.\nStingray says the TuneIn brand will remain. Once the deal closes, Stingray expects its revenue to exceed $400 million.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n"

    "body": "\nCash App released a slate of new features as part of its fall update, including an AI chatbot that can answer questions about users’ finances, a new benefits program, and the ability to discover places that accept Bitcoin payments and make Bitcoin payments using USD.\nThe company is launching an assistant called Moneybot that can answer questions about spending patterns and income, and provide insights for maintaining savings and setting aside money for investments.\nThe chatbot will be available to select users at launch, with broader availability planned for the coming months. Users can ask questions like “Can you show me my monthly income, expenses, and spending patterns?” to get reports about their accounts. The bot also surfaces suggestions for actions like splitting a bill, checking a bitcoin balance, or requesting money from someone.\nImage Credits: Cash App\n“Consumers today are given a host of data around their financial transactions and account balances, but Moneybot takes it a step further by helping to turn those insights into action. No two financial journeys are the same, so we’ve built Moneybot to learn each customer’s habits and tailor its suggestions in real-time,” Cameron Worboys, head of product design at Cash App, said in a statement.\nJack Dorsey-led Block, which owns Cash App and Square, has been creating new ways to promote Bitcoin payments. Last month, it released an integrated Bitcoin solution for merchants to easily receive the cryptocurrency into a wallet. Customers can now discover places that accept Bitcoin through a new map and use USD to pay in cryptocurrency without holding it. The company said it uses the Lightning Network, a layer-2 payment network built on top of Bitcoin, to facilitate transactions via QR codes.\nImage Credits: Cash App\nThe company said that soon it will also allow some customers to send and receive stablecoins through the app.\nBlock is also changing the benefits structure for Cash App customers. Previously, customers who had direct deposits of at least $300 per month qualified for benefits like a 3.5% yield. Now, the company is starting a new program called Cash App Green, where users who either spend $500 or more per month through the Cash App Card or Cash App Pay, or receive deposits or at least $300, qualify for benefits.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits: Cash App\nThese benefits will include a higher borrowing limit — up to $400 for first-time borrowers and a limit increase of up to $300 for others; free overdraft coverage of up to $200 for Cash App Card transactions; free in-network ATM withdrawals; up to 3.5% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances; and five customized weekly offers at different stores.\nBlock said that this new program will make up to 8 million accounts eligible for benefits under the Cash App Green program.\nThe company is also offering a 3.5% APY for teen accounts without any balance limits. Other features in this release include expansion of the Cash App Borrow product to 48 states, and access to some Afterpay buy now pay later (BNPL) services and features within the Cash App without needing a separate login.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOne of the most effective use cases to have emerged from modern AI models is their ability to understand the human voice better, which has led to more accurate dictation tools. One such Mac tool, Willow, is launching an iOS app to let users type with their voice across all apps.\nSimilar to Wispr Flow, Willow’s keyboard transcribes your voice and also formats the message according to the context. The app, which supports over 100 languages, lets you define your own vocabulary terms or create different writing styles across app categories like work, messaging, email, and others.\nOne key advantage of Willow’s app is that there is a full keyboard available to type, whereas Wispr Flow only offers a numeric keyboard. This helps with quick edits to modify some words or sentences rather than typing them out. Plus, you don’t have to switch to another keyboard when you want to type some words instead of speaking them.\nImage Credits Willow\nWillow was founded by Allan Guo and Lawrence Liu, who attended Stanford and dropped out to build a startup. The duo got into Y Combinator in the summer of 2024 with a different set of co-founders (who have now left the company), and their initial idea was in healthcare — specifically to build software to manage assisted living facilities. However, the idea didn’t stick, and for a year, the company tried to build different things.\n“While we were working on healthcare solutions, we noticed that doctors have voice AI scribes that record conversations with patients and create documents for follow-ups. I had a lot of conversations with doctors; they said these notetakers were very useful to them. This nudged us to build a voice AI tool for knowledge workers and other users,” Guo told TechCrunch over a call. \nGuo added that he chose not to build another AI notetaker because he felt that the market was saturated. Instead, the dictation space was more appealing as a lot of communication takes place outside meetings. He said that the company uses a series of models and focuses heavily on tuning its text-to-text pipeline, which is based on Meta’s Llama models, for formatting and personalization\nImage Credits: Willow\nThe startup then moved its YC batch to Spring 2025 to launch the product. The company said that since the launch, it has grown 50% month over month in terms of users. It also has enterprise customers like Uber, Heidi Health, and Zego using the tool for dictation with features like custom team vocabulary.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWillow has raised $4.5 million from Box Group, Y Combinator, Burst Capital, and angel investors such as HubSpot’s Dharmesh Shah; Gusto’s Tomer London; Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; ex-Yelp COO Kipp Bodnar; Opendoor CEO Kaz Nejatian; Adam Guild, co-founder and CEO of the restaurant software company Owner; and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen.\nMullen said that he believes that the most amazing user interfaces in the future are going to be voice-led.\n“I was really impressed with Allan’s vision around not just creating a great dictation app but, long term, aiming for creating an interface that can control your computer,” he said. “When I am writing through Willow, I need to make fewer edits than I had to with a computer’s built-in dictation system.”\nMullen pointed out that one of his favorite workflows was that on desktop, you can also use the “Hey Willow” assistant to instruct the app to write things like email replies in your own voice.\nThe startup competes with other players like Wispr Flow, which has raised more than $56 million in funding to date; Monologue, which is part of Every’s subscription bundle; and the YC-backed startups Aqua, Talktastic, Superwhisper, and Betterdication.\nGuo said that in the coming months, it plans to do platform expansion with Windows and Android, along with better personalization to reduce the number of manual edits users have to do post dictation. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

(Users who use an authenticator app are unaffected.)\nX said this was part of an effort to retire the older twitter.com domain, which currently redirects to x.com. That change took effect in May 2024. The problem is that passkeys and security keys are digitally tied to the old twitter.com domain and can’t be transferred to x.com. That means users have to manually un-enroll and re-enroll using the new x.com domain.\nAs part of the switchover, X warned that after November 10, customers would have their accounts locked until they re-enroll or choose another method of two-factor authentication. \nNow that the deadline has passed, plenty of users are reporting that they’ve been locked out of their accounts and can’t re-enroll their passkey or security key, citing error messages or getting caught in an endless loop.\nThis is the latest issue to beset X, now owned by Elon Musk after he bought Twitter, as it was known then, for $44 billion. Since taking charge of the social networking site, the company has experienced massive layoffs and countless controversies.\nX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk, who now owns X, has been posting as usual, presumably unaffected by the change.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGenAI has become a key part of coding workflows, but most companies struggle to track its use, let alone its return on investment. Israeli startup Milestone hopes to help with a platform designed to correlate AI tool usage with engineering metrics, including code quality.\nThe catch is that these companies have to give Milestone access to their codebases, a bet that investors initially questioned, CEO and co-founder Liad Elidan told TechCrunch. But with customers including Kayak, Monday, and Sapiens, the startup has now raised a $10 million seed funding round led by San Francisco-based venture firm Heavybit and Israeli fund Hanaco Ventures.\nIn an unusual arrangement, Elidan and Milestone’s CTO had gone years without meeting in person by the time they started fundraising. Unlike most of Milestone’s Israel-based team members, Professor Stephen Barrett lives in Ireland and teaches computer science at Trinity College Dublin, where Elidan was once his student and the two bonded through software projects.\nDespite the distance, the duo kept in touch over the years and eventually decided to found a startup focused on engineering efficiency, just as coding assistants and other code-generation tools were taking off. GitHub Copilot has since crossed the bar of 20 million users, but companies still lack visibility into how these tools are used and are impacting productivity.\nAccording to Elidan, Milestone answers these questions by relying on four pillars — codebases, project management platforms, team structure, and the codegen tools themselves — to create what he describes as “a genAI data lake.” In practice, this gives organizations actionable data on which teams use AI and to what effect — thanks to their own information.\nArmed with this data, managers under constant pressure to leverage AI to push productivity are, for instance, able to measure feature delivery speed, Elidan said, but also to find out whether recent bugs were caused by AI-generated code, and to take informed decisions on where to implement these tools. \nThis also gives Milestone a front-row seat on ROI — the “holy grail question” that it aims to answer granularly for its customers. But on a high level, he said, “We don’t have a customer that used Milestone and said, ‘Okay, GenAI doesn’t help me, I’m going to revoke all my licenses.’ It’s actually the opposite. They want to try more Gen AI tools.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis fast-paced adoption also means that Milestone has to keep up with a rapidly evolving landscape. “It used to be auto-completes, then it was chat, then it was agentic-based chat, and it keeps going,” Elidan said. \nThat’s also where Barrett’s academic background helps the team understand the wave of transformation its customers are going through. “A lot of the ways we used to think about engineering are going to have to change,” the professor told TechCrunch. “I think in some sense, AI is filling out the team, and engineers are now becoming managers.”\nTo keep up with the tools that power this wave, Milestone says it has partnered with many vendors, such as GitHub, Augment Code, Qodo, Continue and Atlassian — the company that powers Jira and whose venture arm Atlassian Ventures also participated in this seed round. \nThe round was also supported by angel investors, including GitHub cofounder Tom Preston-Werner, former AT&T CEO John Donovan, Accenture’s senior tech advisor Paul Daugherty, and Datadog’s ex-president Amit Agrawal — who all understand that what Milestone is building is relevant for the enterprise market, Elidan said.\nThat enterprise focus was deliberate from day one, with Milestone even saying no to prospective clients that were too small—”a very hard thing to do,” Elidan said, but one that gave the startup clarity around a roadmap requiring enterprise credentials and features. Focus would be his main advice to other founders, and Milestone is taking it: the startup won’t expand into measuring GenAI’s impact on marketing or other functions, even as it grows.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nWhen former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt, someone from the audience asked him if HBO’s hit satire “Silicon Valley” would be revived. Costolo, who was a writer for the show, essentially answered no (at timestamp 38:17).\nWhile the writers talk about that regularly, he said, they don’t pursue it because today’s actual Silicon Valley is so bizarre, it can’t be parodied.  \nThe latest case in point is a new company called Clad Labs that launched out of Y Combinator this week. Clad’s product is so outside-the-box that people thought it was an April Fools’ joke in November. \nBut it’s a real product, founder Richard Wang told TechCrunch. The product is called “Chad: The Brainrot IDE.” It is yet another vibe coding integrated development environment — an IDE is the software developers use to code — but with a twist. While waiting for the AI coding tool to finish its task, the developer can mess around with their favorite brainrot activities within a window of the IDE. \nOr, as the company’s website advertises: “Gamble while you code. Watch TikToks. Swipe on Tinder. Play minigames. This isn’t a joke — it’s Chad IDE, and it’s solving the biggest productivity problem in AI-powered development that nobody’s talking about.” \nThe founders say their IDE increases productivity by helping with “context switching.” Their argument is, by doing your brainrot activities within the IDE itself, as soon as the AI is done with the task, you’ll get right back to work rather than be focused on your phone or browser. \nReaction on X was mixed. While some people thought it was a fake satire, others thought it was a good — or a terrible — idea.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLike it or hate it, everyone had an opinion, even Jordi Hays, co-host of the enthusiastically pro-tech podcast TBPN. Hays penned a post on the product called, “Rage Baiting is for Losers.” In it he said of Chad IDE: “On one hand it’s funny. On the other hand, what are we doing here and why does this belong on the official YC account?” \nHe argued that products like Chad IDE and Cluely have moved rage bait from a marketing gimmick to a “product strategy” and “it really should not be.” He urged YC to start teaching founders that “rage baiting is for losers.” \nThis is particularly interesting advice from someone who, as a founder, had mastered viral marketing without rage. Hays and his wife Sarah founded Party Round, a funding startup that went viral for their friendly marketing gimmicks like launching NFT versions of top “helpful” VCs. (Party Round rebranded to Capital and sold to Rho in 2024.) \nWang tells TechCrunch what the haters don’t get about his brainrot IDE is that it wasn’t intended to be rage bait. The founders hope it becomes a genuinely beloved AI vibe coder for consumer-app type developers. They want to give these folks a consumer app-like experience in an IDE.\nWhile the product is real, it’s not available to the public yet. \n”We’re currently in a closed beta,” Wang said. Right now, Chad is attempting to build a “community” of users who like the idea. Clad Labs hopes to open the product to the public soon, but for now, users must get an invite from someone already in the beta.\nNo doubt there’s a certain type of developer who would love Chad. But whatever the future holds for this product, one thing is true: It is nearly impossible to parody Silicon Valley these days. \n"

    "body": "\nSearch and rescue missions often happen in areas that are difficult for humans to navigate due to extreme weather, rough terrain, or dangerous conditions like smoke or dust.\nA researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) wants to send robots inspired by bats on these missions instead of humans.\nNitin J. Sanket, a professor at WPI, has developed small flying robots with his team that fit in the palm of a hand and use ultrasound — just like bats. These robots use AI-powered software to filter out noise from the ultrasound signals the devices collect, allowing them to spot obstacles within a two-meter radius.\n“Search and rescue is done on foot,” Sanket told TechCrunch. “There are a lot of people who go on foot with flashlights in really harsh conditions and put their lives at danger to save others. We thought drones are the answer because they can cover a lot of ground really fast. They can be agile and quick.”\nNitin Sanket.Image Credits:Nitin Sanket / WPI\nSanket has long been fascinated by aerial robots and drones and how the tech can be retrofitted for real-world situations. During his PhD program, his adviser challenged him to create the smallest robot possible, which sparked his research into taking cues from biology to build smaller machines.\n“We had to reimagine what a drone would be at that point, which is go back to biology, because biology does this way better than we can today,” Sanket said. “How do insects or birds do it with super limited compute and not-so-good sensing apparatus? Their eyes are not that great, their brains are really small, but they’re still able to do these amazing feats of flight. So we started looking at that, and that’s what gave rise to my PhD thesis.”\nSanket built a prototype of a robotic beehive made up of small drones that could pollinate flowers. Despite his efforts, he realized that this application was probably a moonshot and started thinking of areas where biology-based robots could make a difference sooner, which led him to his current project.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the search and rescue robots, the main challenge was building something with the necessary sensors and flying technology without making the robot too large, expensive, or energy intensive.\nSanket said they turned to the ultrasound sensors used in automatic faucets because they require very little power. While that approach worked, the propellers they built on the robots created too much noise, which overloaded the sensor’s ability to spot obstacles.\nTo fix this problem, they turned back to bats.\n“Bats have these special tissues in their nose, ears, and mouth which adaptively change in thickness and density to modulate the way they hear and chirp sound,” Sanket said. “We were like, ‘Okay, that’s super cool.’ Can we do something like that? We designed a 3D-printed structure to place in front of the robot, which essentially does the same [functionally, as] what a bat does, which is change the shape of the sound itself.”\nNow that they’ve been able to get the robots to work, they are working to tackle their next challenge: improving their speed.\n“We, as human beings, like to try to mimic a lot of things the human brain does,” Sanket said. “We tend to forget how remarkable other animals are, which are much smaller than us. Especially insects and birds, which are much tinier, can actually do remarkable feats of navigation, which I think we don’t really see often. I think we should think more as scientists rather than just pure engineers.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nCrafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do.\nHero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps.\nHere is how it works: When you are booking a flight, you might write “Book a flight” in the prompt. The autocomplete SDK will start populating fields like “to,” “from,” “on date,” “at time,” “airline,” and “returning on.” You can stop at any point and send the query to the chatbot.\nImage Credits:Hero\nThis is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe’s new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets users enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune.\nAdobe’s way to approach easier prompt generation for creating a soundtrack.Image Credits:Adobe\nHero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. With this autocomplete feature, you can get there with fewer prompts — or even just one.\n\n\n\nThe startup’s co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next.\n“With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. This unlocks a whole new set of use cases ranging from travel to commerce, and ads to customer support,” Kowalk said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs.\nKowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query.\nThe startup, which raised $4 million in seed funding last year, has secured $3 million in additional funding led by Forerunner Ventures. Kowalk said that in the coming months, depending on the app and SDK growth, Hero plans to raise a bigger round.\nHero is testing a version of this technology in its app that helps users find time for a meeting or to catch up with a friend through autocomplete prompts. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months.\nThe company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV’s parent company, Google, has been locked in a standoff with Disney for nearly two weeks. The dispute began when the two companies failed to reach an agreement on a streaming deal.\nThis means that for 12 days and counting, 10  million YouTube TV subscribers like myself have not been able to access Disney-owned TV networks like ABC and ESPN, which comprise around 20 different channels.\nBusiness Insider called sports fans “the big losers” in this standoff. The New York Times and Engadget are publishing guides to help viewers tune into must-watch college football games. But the press has ignored a beleaguered demographic suffering in silence while their peers boot up Fubo trials to watch Monday Night Football.\nIt’s me. I’m beleaguered. I can’t watch “Jeopardy!” because it airs on ABC.\n“Jeopardy!” is a longstanding fixture in my nightly routine. I finish work. I make dinner. I watch “Jeopardy!” So imagine my surprise in early November when I turned on YouTube TV, only to find that the most recent episode had not recorded. In fact, months of my “Jeopardy!” recordings had vanished! The horror! Who’s the current “Jeopardy!” champion? Has Ken Jennings worn any cool ties lately? I don’t know. Because I can’t watch “Jeopardy!”\nYouTube TV and Disney have been locked in this public dispute for weeks. On October 23, YouTube TV wrote in a statement that it has been “working in good faith” to negotiate a deal with Disney, but that the company is “proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers … while benefitting Disney’s own live TV products.” From Disney’s perspective, YouTube TV is “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\nOn Sunday, YouTube TV announced that it would give subscribers a $20 credit — which must be manually redeemed — to compensate for nearly two weeks of a Disney blackout. While I thank the $3.46 trillion giant Google for its generosity, might I point out that in 2021, when a similar dispute blacked out Disney’s channels from YouTube TV for one day, subscribers got a $15 credit? (Also, YouTube TV cost almost $20 less per month back then.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Disney will lose an estimated $60 million over two weeks — $4.3 million per day — by not making a deal with YouTube TV. But Disney could also be generating new income streams with the recently launched ESPN Unlimited subscription, which gives subscribers access to all ESPN content for $30 per month. However, we must note that ESPN Unlimited crucially does not include “Jeopardy!,” America’s Favorite Quiz Show®.\nI could, like many others, use this opportunity to scope out other cord-cutting streamers, perhaps those owned by Disney — however, I may or may not be sharing my YouTube TV account with five other people, leaving me pretty locked into a sweet deal. (Please, YouTube TV, don’t pull a Netflix on me.)\nWhen will this national nightmare end? When will I once again be able to criticize contestants’ mathematically illogical Daily Double wagers? When will I be reminded that I know literally nothing about opera? The ball’s in your court, Mr.  Mouse.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nWisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm).  \nThis round comes roughly six months after the startup announced a seed round of $23 million led by Coatue. \nWisdomAI offers AI-driven data analytics that can answer business questions from structured, unstructured, and even “dirty” data, meaning data that hasn’t been cleaned of typos or errors. A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what’s preventing them from closing this quarter?”  \nBut the company is using a clever method to eliminate the LLM hallucination problem. WisdomAI is not using LLMs to write answers to questions. Instead, LLMs are only used to write the query —  the part that will go out to a data warehouse to retrieve data. So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers.\nWisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup’s co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. (Mazumdar left Rubrik in 2023.)\nSince formally launching in late 2024, WisdomAI has grown from two enterprise customers to around 40 enterprise customers, CEO Mazumdar says. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. \nMazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Some customers have doubled usage within two months. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the last six months, WisdomAI has also added an agentic feature that will alert users in real time to important changes in situations they are monitoring. \n“I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.\n“I think that’s the magic with analytics. It’s always been a static report, but we are making it dynamic. We are making it proactive,” he said. \n"

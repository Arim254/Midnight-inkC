Major platforms — including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva — announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.\n“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.\nOpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added. \nThis is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

The company is now working on an image and video model codenamed “Mango” along with a new text-based model internally known as “Avocado,” The Wall Street Journal reported.\nThe tech giant plans to release the new models in the first half of 2026, the publication said, citing an internal Q&A at Meta on Thursday, where Wang and chief product officer Chris Cox unveiled the new roadmap.\nWang had said Meta aims to make the text-based model better at coding while also exploring new world models that understand visual information and can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every possibility.\nMeta has more recently fallen behind its rivals, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, in the AI race. The company’s AI division saw significant restructurings this year, which included leadership changes and the poaching of researchers from other top companies. However, several of the researchers who joined Meta SuperIntelligence Labs (MSL) have already left the company. \nLast month, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, also announced that he’s leaving to create his own startup. \nMeta doesn’t have a winning AI product as of yet. Instead, Meta AI assistant’s numbers are buoyed by the company’s existing social networks spanning billions of users, since the company places the assistant in the search bar of its apps.\nThis means the first projects and models coming out of MSL will have a lot riding on them. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”\nThat new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. \nThe closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.\nMuch of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.\nThe U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nApple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.\nThe agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.\nAdditionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.\nInstacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.\n“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\nInstacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDXS International, a U.K.-based company that provides healthcare tech for England’s National Health Service (NHS), disclosed a cyberattack in a statement on Thursday.\nIn a filing with the London Stock Exchange, the company said it experienced a “a security incident affecting its office servers,” discovered on December 14. The company said it “immediately” contained the breach working together with the NHS, and hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate “the nature and extent of the incident.”\n“There was minimal impact on the company’s services and the company’s front-line clinical services remain unaffected and operational,” read the filing.\nAt this point, the specific nature of the breach is not known, nor whether any patients’ medical information was stolen. \nHowever, earlier this week, a ransomware group called DevMan took credit for the breach. In a post on its dark web site, which TechCrunch has seen, the hackers listed the company on December 14 and claimed to have stolen 300 gigabytes of data from the company.\nDXS said it also notified law enforcement and regulators, including the UK’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO, about the cyberattack.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about the breach at DXS International? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nDXS chief operating officer Steven Bauer did not respond to a series of questions. Instead, Bauer sent TechCrunch a statement echoing the public filing. \nRashana Sweidan Vigerstaff, a spokesperson for the ICO, told TechCrunch that the ICO is assessing the information provided by DXS, while also not responding to several questions.   \nNHS England spokesperson Katie Baldwin told TechCrunch that the health service is “not aware of any patient services being impacted.”\nOn its website, DXS says it provides software that helps to reduce costs for doctors and primary care physicians. As such, the company’s software touches patient records and data. The company also says that in some cases, its solutions are hosted on the NHS’ Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), which is a system for healthcare organizations across the U.K. to access and share information. \nGenerally speaking, the NHS does not store patient’s medical data in a centralized system.\nUpdated with responses from DXS and the ICO.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data.

    "body": "\nThe last decade is filled with examples of fintechs that have reshaped how U.S. businesses manage money. Brex simplified corporate cards. Ramp automated spend controls. Mercury rebuilt startup banking. But this wave of financial innovation has largely skipped one major part of the economy: nonprofits.\nGivefront, a YC-backed startup founded by 21-year-old Harvard dropout Matt Tengtrakool and UC Berkeley’s Aidan Sunbury, aims to change that. The company is building a financial platform designed specifically for nonprofits, including food banks, animal rescues, non-governmental organizations, churches, and homeowner associations.\nNonprofits generate roughly 6% of the U.S. GDP and contribute trillions of dollars each year, yet most still rely on outdated financial tools. Givefront believes that modern spend management, compliance, and reporting infrastructure — tailored to nonprofit realities — can unlock significant efficiency gains across the sector.\nBefore starting Givefront, Tengtrakool experimented with a microloan aggregation startup in Nigeria. He later worked inside several nonprofits while studying computer science and statistics at Harvard, including running a few organizations himself. At one nonprofit, he helped grow donations to nearly $500,000. Tengtrakool says these experiences revealed a clear gap that nonprofits face. They have strict regulatory and reporting requirements but lack the tools that modern businesses take for granted.\n“I’ve always been interested in financial systems, and this work fits naturally with that,” the chief executive told TechCrunch. “While helping run these nonprofits with a few other students, we realized most of them didn’t have adequate financial tools to ensure compliance or protect their tax-exempt status. The tools they relied on were completely out of sync with what’s considered modern in the startup world.”\nTengtrakool initially built the first version of Givefront to solve those problems internally. What started as tooling for organizations he worked with soon expanded to local nonprofits across the country. Over time, the team narrowed its focus to a unified financial platform built exclusively for registered nonprofit organizations, about 1.9 million of them in the U.S.\nGivefront entered Y Combinator Winter 2024 with a broad vision spanning banking and accounting. The team quickly learned, however, that convincing nonprofits to replace accountants or core banking relationships required a slow and painful sales process, ushering a pivot to cards and spend management.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s much easier to get an organization to switch the card they use than to replace their entire accounting stack,” Tengtrakool said.\nAlthough Givefront offers features similar to corporate spend platforms like Ramp and Brex, its exclusive focus on nonprofits sets it apart.\nNonprofits operate under constraints most businesses never face. They manage restricted and unrestricted grants, report spending to donors and foundations, track volunteer expenses, and file IRS Form 990 disclosures. Many nonprofits manage dozens of grants at once, each with its own spending and reporting rules.\nLegacy nonprofit systems such as Blackbaud, Sage, and MIP still dominate the market, but they often lack real-time spend controls, modern approval workflows, and seamless integrations with the tools nonprofits increasingly depend on.\nRather than replacing these systems outright, Givefront positions itself as a vertical layer that sits on top of them. The platform integrates with legacy accounting software while adding nonprofit-specific spend controls, receipt capture for audits, grant-based budgeting, and automated reporting.\n“Many of the workflows we’re building are deeply specific to how this part of the economy works,” Tengtrakool said. “Our workflows and integrations are a 10x improvement when compared to traditional corporate or spend management tools.”\nGivefront generates revenue from card interchange and subscriptions tied to its bill pay feature. Over time, Givefront plans to expand revenues by launching adjacent products, including payroll, banking, budgeting, and potentially investment and endowment management.\nSince launching its cards roughly six months ago, Givefront has onboarded hundreds of organizations and reports more than 200% month-over-month growth in revenue and total payment volume. The company expects to serve about 1,000 nonprofits by the end of the year, with a longer-term goal of reaching 5,000 organizations by mid-next year.\nTengtrakool says the team’s youth, which also includes a 17-year-old founding engineer, has served as both an advantage and a challenge so far. Some nonprofit leaders find the team’s age refreshing, while others hesitate to trust financial infrastructure to such a young group. \nChurches and religious organizations have driven the strongest adoption, he says. Many rely on volunteer treasurers instead of full-time finance staff, and Givefront’s automation significantly reduces their operational burden.\nThe company recently closed a $2 million round, led by Script Capital with participation from Y Combinator, C3 Ventures, Phoenix Fund, and angels, including the CEOs of Chariot and Wealthfront. The seed investment will help the company scale distribution, grow its team, and expand its cards and bill pay offerings.\n"

    "body": "\nEthereal Exploration Guild, an Indian space tech startup better known as EtherealX — developing a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle — is close to securing about $21 million in a new funding round co-led by TDK Ventures, with Accel among the participants, TechCrunch has learned.\nInitially planned as a $15 million Series A, the round has drawn strong investor demand and is now expected to reach about $20.5 million, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The funding comes more than a year after the startup raised a $5 million seed round in August 2024.\nTDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.\nThe funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.\nFounded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.\nThe Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX’s rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 typically charges between $1,600 and $2,000 per kilogram.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“At the price point at which we will enter the market, we’ll comfortably capture 30% to 40% of it,” Nair said at the time.\nIndia has emerged as one of the few countries globally with a geographic and regulatory advantage for space launches, offering access to multiple orbital inclinations from a single launch site. Its growing space tech ecosystem is also attracting global investors seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.\nEtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn post by Nair.\nIndia is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, targeting an 8% to 10% market share over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups. The country is working toward a $40 billion to $45 billion space economy within the next eight to 10 years, Indian Space Minister Jitendra Singh said recently.\nNair declined to comment. TDK Ventures, Accel, and BIG Capital did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs online platforms grapple with how to establish trust at a global scale and address growing concerns about authenticity, the adoption of profile verification on LinkedIn is picking up pace in 2025. India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.\nLinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, according to Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that more than 100 million users have added at least one verification.\nIn 2022, LinkedIn began rolling out profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before expanding to government-issued ID checks, and has since been extended to company pages and job listings.\nMost LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.\nAbout 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.\nThe pace of India growth\nGeographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets, including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.\nWhile the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndia is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with more than 160 million users, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.\nAs verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform. \nEarlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.\nLinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.\n“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Rivian\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:57 AM PST · December 18, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nRivian’s new second-generation R1 EVs are receiving an update today that brings the new “Universal Hands-Free” driving software, which the company revealed last week at its first-ever “Autonomy & AI Day.”\nThe company says the new feature allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel on more than 3.5 million miles of roads in the United States and Canada, including a mix of highways and surface streets, as long as there are visible lane lines. \nOwners will still have to supervise the driving system and, crucially, it “will not stop or slow down for traffic lights or stop signs.” Universal Hands-Free will also not make turns or follow navigation. (Rivian says the software will re-engage if a driver uses their turn signal and handles the turn manually.)\nIt’s an important step forward for the company, which is aiming to make its vehicles capable of full autonomy over the next few years. But it also comes with risk: Rival automakers with similar systems like Tesla and Ford have dealt with multiple crashes and deaths, many related to drivers’ attention straying from the driver assistance systems. Those crashes have led to investigations and lawsuits.\nThe updated software greatly expands the driver assistance capabilities that were previously available to Rivian owners. Before the update, Rivian’s hands-free driving system only worked on 135,000 miles of highways. Rivian detailed plans at last week’s event to eventually allow its vehicles to drive themselves from “point-to-point,” though that feature will not ship until 2026. \nRivian is developing a new autonomy computer with custom silicon for its R2 SUV (which debuts in 2026) that, combined with a roof-mounted lidar sensor, will be capable of one day making the company’s vehicles fully autonomous, CEO RJ Scaringe said last week. \nThe software update released Thursday brings a few other features not related to Rivian’s driver assistance system. There’s a new version of its digital key that owners of second-generation R1 vehicles can add to digital wallets on iPhones, Apple Watches, Google Pixels, and Samsung phones. Owners of quad-motor variants of the Gen 2 R1 EVs are also getting the long-teased “Kick Turn” feature, as well as the “RAD Tuner” customizable drive modes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nKrafton, the South Korean gaming company behind hit titles such as PUBG and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), is launching a growth investment fund focused on India, stepping up its push into the world’s largest internet user base.\nCalled the Unicorn Growth Fund, the investment vehicle is a collaboration between Krafton and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver, and investor Mirae Asset. It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.\nThe fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.\nNaver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.\nKrafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.\nTo date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content and fintech spaces. Recent investments include fintech Cashfree and venture fund IMM Investment, alongside earlier bets on gaming and content platforms such as Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, and Kuku FM. The company also launched a gaming incubator in India in 2023, and acquired a controlling stake in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.\nKrafton’s expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi banned BGMI, the company’s flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 following a three-month trial approval. Krafton subsequently announced a $150 million investment commitment in the country.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBGMI, which has surpassed 240 million downloads, launched in 2021 as a revamped, localized version of PUBG Mobile, another popular title that was banned by the Indian government in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Since then, Krafton has made a series of operational changes in the country — including cutting ties with Tencent as its publisher and migrating its India servers to Microsoft’s Azure cloud — to address regulatory concerns.\nWith the new fund, Krafton is looking to extend its India strategy beyond gaming, channeling capital into a wider set of technology startups as it seeks to build a long-term presence in one of Asia’s fastest-growing digital markets.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEvery year, TechCrunch looks back at the cybersecurity horrorshows of the past 12 months — from the biggest data breaches to hacks resulting in weeks of disruption — to see what we can learn. This year, the data breaches were like nothing we’ve seen before. \nHere’s our look back at some of the biggest security incidents of 2025, starting with:\nThe U.S. federal government was breached, several times over\nThe U.S. government remained one of the biggest targets in cyberspace. The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw. \nAll the while, the Russian hackers were stealing sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.\nBut nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history.\nWASHINGTON, DC – MAY 30: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with a visible black eye, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.Image Credits:Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images\nThe Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, violated federal protocols and defied common security practices. They ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data, despite warnings of the national security risks and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.\nMusk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that they could face federal charges without his protection.\nHackers are extorting dozens of companies whose Oracle E-Business servers were breached\nIn late September, senior executives at American corporate giants began receiving threatening emails from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.\nMonths earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from dozens of organizations that rely on Oracle’s software.\nOracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was scrambling to patch the vulnerability. It was too late, though: the hackers had already stolen gobs of data from universities, hospitals and health systems, media organizations, and more.\nThis was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as GoAnywhere, MOVEit, and Cleo Software, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.\nHacker collective steals at least 1 billion records from Salesforce databases\nSalesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud. \nHackers targeted at least two companies, Salesloft and Gainsight, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce. \nBy breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, Linkedin, SonicWall and Verizon.\nA hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a data leak site advertising the stolen records in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.\nHackers ransack the UK retail sector, and disrupt operations at Jaguar Land Rover, denting the economy\nHackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from Marks & Spencer and at least 6.5 million customer records from the Co-op. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out.

A September hack and data breach saw JLR’s car plant stall production for months as the company worked to get its systems back up and running. \nThe fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown. \nU.K. security experts said the breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.\nSouth Korea sees months of hacks and data breaches\nSouth Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.\nThe country’s largest phone company, SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a massive data center fire wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.\nBut the cherry on data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The data theft began in June, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the company’s chief executive resigning.\n"

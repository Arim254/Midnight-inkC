    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n5:20 PM PST · December 4, 2025\n\nImage Credits:SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nThe Chicago Tribune filed a lawsuit against AI search engine Perplexity on Thursday alleging copyright infringement. The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York.\nThe Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims.\nThe Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. \nInterestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles.\nThe Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material in April. That suit is ongoing. Another nine from these publishers sued the model maker and its cloud provider in November, too.\nWhile creators have filed many lawsuits against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well.\nPerplexity did not immediately respond to the Chicago Tribune’s story about its own lawsuit, nor to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Perplexity is facing other such suits. Reddit filed one in October. Dow Jones is also suing. Last month, while Amazon didn’t sue, it did threaten to by sending a cease-and-desist letter over AI browser shopping.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n"

    "body": "\nMeta has signed commercial AI data agreements with news publishers to offer real-time global, entertainment, and breaking news on Meta AI, its AI chatbot. Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday.\nThese responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers’ websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. \nMeta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today.\nThe company plans to add new partnerships in the future.\nThe move comes as Meta shifted away from making its platforms hubs for news. For example, it killed Facebook’s “News” tab in 2024. Additionally, Meta stopped compensating news publishers in 2022, but is now doing so to help supercharge its AI chatbot with real-time access to news.\n“We’re committed to making Meta AI more responsive, accurate, and balanced,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “Real-time events can be challenging for current AI systems to keep up with, but by integrating more and different types of news sources, our aim is to improve Meta AI’s ability to deliver timely and relevant content and information with a wide variety of viewpoints and content types.”\nThe company is looking to attract more users to its AI chatbot as it faces increasing competition from rivals. Meta is also looking to stay relevant in the AI race after the controversial release of Llama 4, which was met with complaints of poor performance earlier this year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta AI is available in over 200 countries and can be accessed through the company’s apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as through the standalone Meta AI app.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "The battery storage industry in the U.S. has grown in leaps and bounds in recent years, surpassing its most aggressive targets to become one of the largest new sources of power on the grid.",
    "body": "\nNearly a decade ago, when the energy storage market was in its infancy, an industry organization set a dreamy goal: By the end of 2025, the U.S. would deploy 35 gigawatts of batteries connected to the grid.\nSo how’d the storage industry do? In the third quarter, 4.7 gigawatts of batteries were installed. In sum, more than 40 gigawatts have been deployed, and the year isn’t over, Canary Media reported. In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.\nWhat’s more, that’s nearly half of all new renewable power deployed on the grid for July through September, and this year, renewables have been the leading source of all new capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nMuch of the new storage capacity has been deployed in Arizona, California, and Texas, states where the grid has been strained in recent years. Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.\nStartups have been taking note. \nRedwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a new business line focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds. \nBy 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, investing another $350 million in the company to propel the new business line. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup raised $1 billion in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion beyond Texas. The company has deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours of batteries in Texas. \nWhile lithium-ion batteries have dominated new installations, other startups are pursuing other technologies that could lower storage costs significantly. \nSizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean. Fourth Power is using blocks of carbon to store heat at super-high temperatures, and it’s looking to deploy them in 2028 at a cost that’s lower than lithium-ion batteries or peaking natural gas power plants. XL Batteries is deploying its flow-battery technology at petrochemical storage sites, allowing it to store hundreds of megawatt-hours using existing infrastructure. And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.\nAltogether, it points to an industry that’s in the midst of an exponential expansion. Paired with solar and wind, which remain the cheapest forms of new electricity, energy storage has the potential to rewire global energy markets, and the U.S. grid along with them.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nHarvey on Thursday confirmed it closed a round of funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz, that values the legal AI startup at $8 billion after reports of the funding leaked in October. The startup raised $160 million in the round.\nThis latest capital infusion came just months after it raised $300 million in a Series E round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation in February.\nHarvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey released some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams.\nAs an industry entirely based on words, it makes sense that legal functions would be a perfect use case for LLMs: searching, summarizing, and drafting, all based on domain-specific training. But Harvey is also one of the best examples of how VCs are “kingmaking” these days. That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nGiven that Harvey was founded in 2022, it may be far enough ahead of competitors — both in customer acquisition and the reinforced training from working with so many law firms — that it is the king of this market. At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so.\nGil told TechCrunch that Harvey is one of the AI market leaders that is experiencing bona fide growth because its tech and market position are “just working.”\nHarvey’s founder and CEO Winston Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos an incredible story of how it originally claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt all started with a proof of concept about landlord-tenant law and a cold email to Sam Altman. Harvey became one of OpenAI Startup Fund’s first investments. And it’s been a VC darling ever since.\n"

    "description": "The New York Times filed a copyright lawsuit against Perplexity, joining other publishers using legal action as leverage to force AI companies into licensing deals that compensate content creators.",
    "body": "\nThe New York Times filed suit Friday against AI search startup Perplexity for copyright infringement, its second lawsuit against an AI company. The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the Chicago Tribune, which also filed suit this week.\nThe Times’s suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.” \nThe lawsuit – filed even as several publishers, including The Times, negotiate deals with AI firms – is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism.\nPerplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a Publishers’ Program last year, which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, Perplexity also launched Comet Plus, allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images.\n“While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity’s unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.”\nSimilar to the Tribune’s suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity’s method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant. \n“Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads.“Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or near-verbatim reproductions, summaries, or abridgments of the original content, including The Times’s copyrighted works.”  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOr, as James put it in his statement,  “RAG allows Perplexity to crawl the internet and steal content from behind our paywall and deliver it to its customers in real time. That content should only be accessible to our paying subscribers.”\nThe Times also claims Perplexity’s search engine has hallucinated information and falsely attributed it to the outlet, which damages its brand.\nPerplexity could not be reached for comment.\nThe lawsuit comes just over a year after The Times sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity demanding it stop using its content for summaries and other output. The outlet claims it has contacted Perplexity several times over the past 18 months to stop using its content unless an agreement could be negotiated.\nThis isn’t the first fight The Times has picked with an AI firm. The Tims is also suing OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the two trained their AI systems with millions of the outlet’s articles without offering compensation. OpenAI has argued that its use of publicly available data for AI training constitutes “fair use,” and has shot its own accusations at the Times, claiming the outlet manipulated ChatGPT to find evidence. \nThat case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement. \nThe Times’s lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp – which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and the New York Post – made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit.\nOther outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have accused Perplexity of plagiarism and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don’t want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare recently confirmed. \nIn its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content. \nThe Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters’ work. The outlet earlier this year struck a multiyear deal with Amazon to license its content to train the tech giant’s AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. OpenAI has inked deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nIn one of the most groundbreaking deals the streaming world has ever seen, Netflix announced on Friday its acquisition of Warner Bros. with an enterprise value of $82.7 billion. \nThis agreement involves both HBO Max and the HBO studio, marking one of the largest mergers in Hollywood’s history. By making this move, Netflix is not just solidifying its top position but also significantly enhancing its content library, gaining access to well-known franchises such as DC Comics, “Game of Thrones,” and “Harry Potter.” \nWhile Netflix boasted over 300 million paying subscribers in January, HBO Max, in combination with Discovery+, currently has around 128 million subscribers.\nAdditionally, the scale of Netflix’s offer is notable, as the streaming giant is investing $72 billion, which exceeds Warner Bros.’ entire market valuation of $60 billion.\nHowever, this merger isn’t without its challenges; it could face antitrust scrutiny. \nIn November, senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal expressed concerns regarding the potential sale. The trio sent a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division indicating that any agreement would be viewed “under a cloud of political favoritism and corruption.”\nAdditionally, various industry players are expressing their views. According to Variety, an anonymous group reportedly sent a letter to Congress urging them to publicly oppose Netflix’s offer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWarner Bros. Discovery officially put itself up for sale in October, burdened by debt and disappointing streaming growth. The company attracted interest from several suitors, with Paramount seen as the frontrunner.\nThe acquisition is expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2026, after Warner Bros. Discovery follows through with its plan to separate from Discovery Global, which includes its collection of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN.\nThe companies estimate that the transaction, a mix of cash and stock, will be completed within 12 to 18 months.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "description": "The EC is taking issue with the fact that X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, has been allowing anyone to buy a \"blue checkmark,\" the platform's long-standing symbol that a user has been verified to be who they are claiming to be.",
    "body": "\nThe European Commission has imposed its first fine under Europe’s landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), and it’s against Elon Musk’s X.\nThe EC is taking issue with the fact that X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, has been allowing anyone to buy a “blue checkmark,” the platform’s long-standing symbol which used to indicate that a user has been verified to be who they are claiming to be.\nCalling the design of the blue checkmark system “deceptive,” the European Union’s executive arm on Friday imposed a fine of €120 million (about $140 million) on X, saying the company had breached its transparency obligations under the DSA. \nThe Commission said other breaches of the law include a lack of transparency of X’s advertising repository and failure to provide researchers access to public data.\nBefore Musk bought the company, Twitter used to issue blue checks to journalists, celebrities, politicians, and public figures on the platform after it had verified their identity. Musk did away with that policy in 2023, and all the “verified” blue check today indicates is that a user subscribes to X Premium, and that they meet certain eligibility criteria, like having a profile photo, a display name, and have linked their account to a phone number.\n“X’s use of the ‘blue checkmark’ for ‘verified accounts’ deceives users,” the Commission wrote in a statement. “This violates the DSA obligation for online platforms to prohibit deceptive design practices on their services. On X, anyone can pay to obtain the ‘verified’ status without the company meaningfully verifying who is behind the account, making it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and content they engage with.”\nThe Commission added that such a system exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud and manipulation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe regulator also found that X’s advertisement repository doesn’t comply with DSA requirements for transparency and accessibility, saying the company imposes excessive delays in processing requests for access. The Commission also said the ads repository doesn’t house important information like the content or topic of ads, as well as who paid for those ads.\n“This hinders researchers and the public to independently scrutinise any potential risks in online advertising,” the Commission wrote.\nAccess to public data is another area of concern for the EU. The DSA mandates that public platforms allow researchers access to public data to study systemic risks, and the EC’s investigation has found that X does not allow researchers to independently do that.\n“Moreover, X’s processes for researchers’ access to public data impose unnecessary barriers, effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union,” the EC wrote.\nThe decision comes two years after the EC launched an investigation into the company on the suspected breach of rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency, and data access for researchers.\n“Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads, and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU,” Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy at the European Commission, said in a statement.\nX now has 60 days to outline how it intends to address the complaint about the blue checkmarks, and 90 days to respond with an action plan for addressing the breaches relating to ads and public data transparency and accessibility.\nConfirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei shared his thoughts on if the AI industry was in a bubble at The New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday. This was in addition to throwing shade on one particular unnamed competitor, which was clearly OpenAI.\nAmodei declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer to the question of a bubble, saying it was a complex situation, but instead explained his thoughts about the economics of AI in more detail.\nHe described himself as bullish on the potential of the technology, but cautioned that there could be players in the ecosystem who might make a “timing error” or could see “bad things” happen when it comes to the economic payoffs.\n“There’s an inherent risk when the timing of the economic value is uncertain,” Amodei explained. He said companies had to take risks to compete with each other and authoritarian adversaries — a reference to the threat from China — but added that some players were not “managing that risk well, who are taking unwise risks.”  \nThe issue, he said, is the uncertainty around how quickly the economic value of AI will grow and properly mapping that to the lag times on building more data centers.\n“There’s [a] genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,” Amodei said. “And then I think there are some players who are ‘YOLO-ing,’ who pull the risk dial too far, and I’m very concerned,” he added, using the slang term for “you only live once,” which is often used to justify risk-taking.\nPlus, he spoke to the question around AI chips’ deprecation timelines. That’s another hot-button topic and a factor that could negatively impact the industry’s economics if GPUs become obsolete and lose their value ahead of schedule.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The issue isn’t the lifetime of the chips — chips keep working for a long time. The issue is new chips come out that are faster and cheaper…and so the value of old chips can go down somewhat,” Amodei said.\nHe said Anthropic was making conservative assumptions on this front and others as it planned for an uncertain future.\nThe AI company’s revenue has grown 10x per year over the past three years, the CEO said, going from zero to $100 million in 2023, then $100 million to $1 billion in 2024, and will land somewhere between $8-10 billion by the end of this year. \nBut Amodei said he would be “really dumb” to just assume that the pattern would continue. “I don’t know if a year from now, if it’s going to be 20 billion or if it’s going to be 50…it’s very uncertain. I try to plan conservatively. So I plan for the lower side of it, but that is very disconcerting,” he said.\nAI companies like his have to plan how much compute they’ll need in the years ahead, and how much they should invest in data centers. If they don’t buy enough, they may not be able to serve their customers. And if they buy too much, they’ll struggle to keep up with costs or, in the worst-case scenario, they could go bankrupt. \nLast month, OpenAI landed in a PR crises when its CFO said she wanted the U.S. government to “backstop” her company’s infrastructure loans, aka insure them so taxpayers would pick of the bill if OpenAI could not. After the furor, she walked back the comments. \nThose who take more risks could overextend themselves, Amodei warned, especially if “you’re a person who just kind of, like constitutionally, just wants to ‘YOLO’ things, or just likes big numbers,” he said, in a veiled reference to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n“We think we’re going to be okay in, basically, almost all worlds…I can’t speak for other companies,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nApple’s executive shake-up continues. Days after announcing AI chief John Giannandrea’s departure, and the loss of design exec Alan Dye to Meta, the iPhone maker shared the news of two more exec retirements.\nKate Adams, who has served as Apple’s general counsel since 2017, will retire late next year, while Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, will retire in late January 2026.\nThe company also announced the hiring of Jennifer Newstead, who will become its general counsel on March 1, 2026, reporting to chief executive Tim Cook, after a transition of duties from Adams.\nNewstead arrives from Meta, where she was chief legal officer. Before that, she served as the legal adviser of the U.S. Department of State, where she led the team advising the secretary of state on legal issues affecting the conduct of U.S. foreign relations.\nShe also held other government positions in the past, including as general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as a principal deputy assistant attorney general of the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, as associate White House counsel, and as a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court. \nNewstead will oversee both the Legal and Government Affairs organizations, noted Cook.\n“We couldn’t be more pleased to have Jennifer join our team,” he said. “She brings an extraordinary depth of experience and skill to the role, and will advance Apple’s important work all over the world.” \nDuring Adams’ time at Apple, the company faced increased antitrust regulation and lawsuits, largely focused on increasing competition in the app market.\nMeanwhile, Jackson, who had previously been appointed to the EPA before joining Apple in 2013, was involved with Apple’s climate initiatives, sustainability efforts, environmental impact, and DEI-focused endeavors, like its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. Such efforts have fallen out of favor at corporate giants under the Trump administration.\n“I am deeply appreciative of Lisa’s contributions. She has been instrumental in helping us reduce our global greenhouse emissions by more than 60 percent compared to 2015 levels,” said Cook in a statement. “She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security.”\nApple has seen a number of changes in leadership in recent months, having also announced the departure of chief operating officer Jeff Williams in July, with duties shifting to Sabih Khan, who had previously served as the senior vice president of operations. Before Giannandrea’s exit, Apple had replaced him as head of the Siri team with Mike Rockwell, who had been VP of the Vision Products Group.\nThe company also lost Ke Yang, the executive leading Apple’s work on AI-driven web search, to Meta; and it saw the departure of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s former head of AI models, who left for Meta earlier this year.\nThe leadership changes as Apple has fallen behind in the AI race, pushing back the launch of an AI-powered Siri, which will now run Google’s models under the hood. Apple has also been criticized by designers for losing its sharp attention to detail that the company has long been known for. This reportedly led to some celebration of Dye’s departure among Apple employees, per a report from Daring Fireball, who are glad that a career interface and interaction designer, Stephen Lemay, has taken over the role.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn its latest retreat from India’s crowded online retail market, Walmart-backed fintech giant PhonePe has wound down its Pincode e-commerce app and will shift the business toward B2B services for offline merchants.\nOn Thursday, PhonePe founder and group CEO Sameer Nigam said operating a consumer-facing quick-commerce app had become a distraction from the company’s core focus on small retailers. The company instead wants to concentrate on helping stores “achieve operational efficiency, improved margins and visibility,” he said, citing this as its primary objective.\nPhonePe launched Pincode in April 2023 as a major push into e-commerce, building it on the Indian government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The hyperlocal app offered groceries, medicines, food, electronics, and home décor from neighbourhood shops. It rolled out first in Bengaluru and later expanded to other cities.\nWithin a little over a year of launch, Pincode pulled out of most categories except food. Earlier this year, the app shifted to a quick-commerce model, offering 10-minute deliveries through local kirana shops and retailers in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. The company also expanded the service to 10-minute medicine deliveries in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune in April.\nPhonePe’s Pincode utilized local shops and retail stores for its quick deliveries — a contrast to rivals like Swiggy, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto, which rely on dark stores. The shift did not help Pincode gain ground in the crowded segment, prompting PhonePe to wind down the service.\nPincode was not PhonePe’s first move into e-commerce. In 2019, the company launched “Switch,” a super-app layer inside its payments app that offered access to food, grocery, shopping, and travel services.\nPhonePe has now shut down the Pincode app and redirected its website to PhonePe’s main site. The company said it will now focus on working with offline retailers by expanding its B2B offerings. In July, PhonePe said it had digitized over 1,000 local stores across Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Varanasi through Pincode, giving them access to digital storefronts, inventory tools, and last-mile delivery services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“As part of this strategic decision, we will now focus the entire Pincode team’s resources towards accelerating the build-out and scale-up of a suite of B2B business solutions for offline businesses across India,” Vivek Lohcheb, CEO of Pincode, said in a prepared statement.\nPhonePe already offers inventory and order-management tools, as well as other ERP software for small businesses, and provides direct sourcing and replenishment services in some categories.\nThe shift comes as PhonePe prepares for a public listing in India, nearly three years after its spin-off from Flipkart. The company filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India through the confidential pre-filing route in September and is targeting a mid-2026 listing. PhonePe is also looking for ways to grow beyond its position as the country’s dominant payments app on the Unified Payments Interface.\nPhonePe did not respond to detailed questions about Pincode’s performance and the timing of the app’s shutdown.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said in an X post Thursday that owners can text and drive with the latest version of his company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver-assistance software, despite the fact that it’s illegal to do so in most states.\nMusk replied to another user who had noticed the newest update to the software, known as FSD, was not flashing a warning as he used his phone while driving. The Tesla CEO wrote the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.”\nMusk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nNearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. \nDespite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. Drivers initially needed to have their hands on the wheel even when FSD was engaged. That requirement was later removed and allowed drivers to have hands off as long as the in-cabin camera detected they were paying attention to the road. \nFSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver-assistance systems.\nMusk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver-assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident. Regulators have found more than a dozen fatal crashes in which Autopilot was active.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently investigating the FSD software after it discovered more than 50 reports of it running red lights or crossing into the wrong lanes. The NHTSA is also probing FSD for reported crashes in low-visibility conditions. The NHTSA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTesla is also near the end of a long legal battle with the California Department of Motor Vehicles over how the company has marketed FSD and its less-capable predecessor, Autopilot. During a series of hearings in July, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading customers for years that their cars can drive themselves. The state agency has asked a judge to suspend the company’s sale and manufacturing of its cars for at least 30 days. A decision in that case is expected by the end of this year.\nCorrection: Tesla Autopilot requires hands on while engaged. FSD initially required hands on and later removed that requirement. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMicro1’s rapid climb over the past two years has pushed it into a cohort of AI companies scaling at breakneck speed. The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).\nToday, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it announced its $35 million Series A at a $500 million valuation.\nAnsari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years.\nMicro1’s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with Scale AI following Meta’s $14 billion investment in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale’s CEO.\nWhile Micro1’s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn’t yet matched its rivals: Mercor’s more than $450 million, sources told TechCrunch, and Surge’s reported $1.2 billion in 2024.\nAnsari attributes Micro1’s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform.\nBeyond supplying expert-level data to leading AI labs, Ansari says two new segments, still barely visible today, are on track to reshape the economics of human data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe first involves non-AI-native Fortune 1000 enterprises that will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks. \nDeveloping these agents requires systematic evaluation: testing frontier models, grading their output, choosing winners, fine-tuning them, and continuously validating performance in production. Ansari argues this cycle depends heavily on human experts evaluating AI behavior at scale.\nThe second is robotics pre-training, which requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls the world’s largest robotics pre-training dataset, collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. Robotics companies will need vast volumes of this data before their systems can reliably operate in homes and offices, he said.\n“We anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non-AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,” said the CEO, who founded Micro1 while at UC Berkeley. “We’re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion-a-year market.”\nEven as new markets emerge, Micro1’s current growth still comes primarily from elite AI labs and AI-heavy enterprises. The startup is scaling its work with these labs on reinforcement learning, the feedback loop  to test and improve model behavior.\n\nMicro1 hopes its early move into robotics data and enterprise agent development, in addition to scaling its specialized RL environments, will help it capture additional market share as the data wars intensify.\nFor now, Ansari says the company is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines. \nThe company currently manages thousands of experts across hundreds of domains, ranging from highly technical fields to surprisingly offline disciplines. Many earn close to $100 an hour, according to Ansari.\n“There are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,” Ansari said. “But the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It’s expanding into areas you wouldn’t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields. We’re very optimistic about where this is heading.”\n\n\n\t\tTage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

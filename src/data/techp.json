Probably not mentioned at the show is that these gadgets might be creating a massive environmental problem.\nIt isn’t something that tends to get much attention, but a new study from Cornell University and the University of Chicago found that by 2050, demand for health wearables could hit 2 billion units per year, or 42 times more than today. Unless we change how they’re made, these devices could generate over a million tons of electronic waste and 100 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same period, the authors warn.\nAn even bigger surprise is that it’s not the plastic that’s the problem. The study, published in Nature, found that the printed circuit board — the device’s “brain” — accounts for 70% of its carbon footprint, largely due to intensive mining and manufacturing.\nThe researchers suggest two fixes: develop chips using common metals like copper instead of rare minerals like gold, and make devices modular so the circuit board can be reused while the outer covering gets replaced.\nWrote one of the study’s co-authors, “When these devices are deployed at global scale, small design choices add up quickly.” It’s something to think about while scrolling through CES announcements.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Biotech & Health\n"

    "body": "\nIf there is one point of consensus among the CES 2026 keynote speakers, it is that AI is reshaping technology with a speed and scale unlike any previous technological revolution.\nIn a live taping on Tuesday of the All-In podcast, co-host Jason Calacanis interviewed Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.\n“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.\nTaneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said. \nCalacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”\nCFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.\nAnother key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.\nMeanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.\nCalacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.\nSternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLMArena, a startup that originally launched as a UC Berkeley research project in 2023, announced on Tuesday that it raised a $150 million Series A at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion. The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund, UC Investments.\nThe startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a $100 million seed round in May at a $600 million valuation. This new round means it raised $250 million in about seven months.\nLMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.\nThe models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.\nThe company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang, and was originally funded through grants and donations.\nLMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.\nIn September, it publicly launched a commercial service, AI Evaluations, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat trajectory, and the startup’s popularity, were enough for VCs to pile in for the Series A, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, The House Fund, LDVP, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Laude Ventures.\n"

The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.\nNarwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. \nImage Credits:Narwal\nThe Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.\nNarwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.\nImage Credits:Narwal\nAlong with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:39 AM PST · January 6, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThreads is exploring games in chats, beginning with a basketball game. A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.\nThe game was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.\n\nLaunching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.\nAs with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.\nIt’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a hidden emoji game in DMs last year. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.\nThe internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently expanded its Communities feature with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it added a “disappearing posts” feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.\nWhile Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nArticul8, an enterprise AI company spun out of Intel in early 2024, has secured more than half of a planned $70 million funding round at a $500 million pre-money valuation, according to its CEO, as it looks to capitalize on growing demand for AI systems in regulated industries.\nThe Series B funding round is structured in two installments, with the first led by Spain’s Adara Ventures, Articul8 founder and CEO Arun K. Subramaniyan (pictured above, center) said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of the initial installment, but said the company expects to close the round in the first quarter of this year.\nArticul8’s valuation for its current funding round marks a roughly fivefold increase from the company’s $100 million post-money Series A valuation in January 2024. Since then, the Santa Clara-based company said it has surpassed $90 million in total contract value — the cumulative value of all signed customer contracts — from 29 paying customers, including Hitachi Energy, AWS, Franklin Templeton, and Intel.\nSubramaniyan told TechCrunch that Articul8 was not under pressure to raise capital, describing the company as revenue-positive following a series of large enterprise contracts.\n“We are not cash-strapped,” he said.\nThe company expects to finish the year with annual recurring revenue of just over $57 million, Subramaniyan said, with roughly 45% to 50% of that already recognized.\nArticul8 develops specialized AI systems that operate within customers’ own IT environments, rather than relying on shared, general-purpose models. Instead of selling standalone models, the company packages its technology as software applications and AI agents tailored to specific business functions, targeting regulated industries such as energy, manufacturing, aerospace, financial services, and semiconductors, where accuracy, auditability, and data control are critical.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nArticul8’s knowledge graph viewImage Credits:Articul8\n“Our competition is pretty much everybody,” said Subramaniyan. “But today, the major competitors are the cloud service providers, because they have realized that their model, as the general-purpose [offerings], are all commodities.”\nHe added that Articul8’s focus on specialized systems appeals to customers who need predictable results and clear audit trails, something that is harder to achieve with general-purpose models run on shared cloud platforms.\nArticul8 plans to use the Series B proceeds primarily to expand research and product development and to scale its operations internationally, with a focus on Europe and parts of Asia.\nAdara Ventures’ participation will help speed-up the European expansion plan, as the European Investment Fund backs the Madrid-based VC firm’s energy fund, Subramaniyan said.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:52 PM PST · January 6, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nMeta’s $2 billion acquisition of AI assistant platform Manus is unsurprisingly caught in a regulatory tug-of-war — but not because of U.S. regulators. They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly not quite as sanguine, according to the Financial Times.\nWhen Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies.\nThe concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’s eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend.\nNow the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent Wall Street Journal article speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature.\nThe concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “It creates a new path for the young AI startups in China.”\nHistory suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor on WeChat even warned that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization.\nMeanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. One expert told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s too early to know if this impacts Meta’s plans to integrate Manus’s AI agent software into its products, but this $2 billion deal may have gotten more complicated than anyone anticipated.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nMobileye made its name, and money, by supplying automakers with millions of computer vision chips designed to support automotive safety features and advanced driver assistance systems. The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software. \nNow, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.\nThe Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.\nThe transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.\n“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”\nMentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap. \nThe benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023. \nOf course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute. \nThe acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nA Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users.\n“You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote.\nHe claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity.\nThose claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually was sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story.\nPeople lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions.\nCasey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.\n“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.\nGenerative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.\nMax Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.\n“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”\nTools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.\nCase in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else. Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nFollowing a wave of lawsuits and investigations over child safety, Roblox has implemented mandatory facial verification for all users who want to access chats. The company is now rolling out the requirement globally after first testing it in a few markets last month.\nTo complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it will delete any images or videos of users. The verification is being processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.\nThe company says users who are 13 and older can also choose to verify their age through ID verification instead of facial verification. Roblox notes that while age checks are optional, they’re required if users want to access communication features. In other words, you don’t have to verify your age to use Roblox, but you do need verification to use chat features.\nIf the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.\nImage Credits:Roblox\n“Leveraging multiple signals, Roblox is constantly evaluating user behavior to determine if someone is significantly older or younger than expected,” the company wrote in a blog post. “In these situations, Roblox will soon ask users to repeat the age-check process.”\nOnce users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.\nRoblox says chat is disabled by default for children under 9 unless a parent provides consent following an age check. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introduction of mandatory age checks comes amid multiple lawsuits, including from the attorneys general of Texas and Louisiana, against Roblox over child safety concerns. The lawsuits were filed following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.\nRoblox has said the new age-check requirement will provide a more accurate way to verify users’ ages, compared with simply having users enter their birth year when creating an account.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Ying Tang/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12:22 PM PST · January 6, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSenator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”\n“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”\nThe bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.\nOver the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.\nWhile the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.\nOpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026. \n“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.\nAnnounced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.\nAmazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.\nAnd as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.\nNotably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.\nAmazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.\nFor people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

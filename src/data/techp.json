Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex: GPT-5.3 Codex.\nThe company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.” \nOpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25% faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing.\nThe new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a new agentic coding model released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n"

This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment’s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.\n“It’s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.”\nThat fourth-quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity, and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.\n“More of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,” Jassy said. “We’re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.”\nAWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.\nJassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on-premise to the cloud.

    "body": "\nReddit suggested on Thursday that its AI-powered search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business — not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver impacting its bottom line. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, “it’s an enormous market and opportunity.”\nIn particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be “better for most queries.”\n“There’s a type of query we’re, I think, particularly good at — I would argue, the best on the internet — which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.\nTraditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation — it’s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. “So that’s the direction we’re going.”\nThe exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.\n“We’re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there’s a lot of potential too,” Huffman added.\nReddit said it’s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.\nThe company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it’s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it’s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site — using AI and machine learning — and make it relevant to whoever shows up.\nThe company announced in 2025 it was planning to combine its AI search feature, Reddit Answers, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made “significant progress” in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include “media beyond text.”\nThough Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it’s not been keeping that to itself. The company’s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit’s “other” revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This “other” revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nPeople without coding backgrounds are discovering that they can build their own custom apps using vibe coding — solutions like Lovable that turn plain-language descriptions into working code.\nWhile these prompt-to-code tools can help create nice prototypes, launching them into full-scale production (as this reporter recently discovered) can be tricky without figuring out how to connect the application with external tech services, such as those that can send text messages via SMS, email, and process Stripe payments.\nIlan Zerbib, who spent five years as Shopify’s director of engineering for payments, is building a solution that could eliminate these back-end infrastructure headaches for nontechnical creators.\nLast summer, Zerbib launched Sapiom, a San Francisco startup developing the financial layer that allows AI agents to securely purchase and access software, APIs, data, and compute — essentially creating a payment system that lets AI automatically buy the services it needs.\nEvery time an AI agent connects to an external tool like Twilio for SMS, it requires authentication and a micro-payment. Sapiom’s goal is to make this whole process seamless, letting the AI agent decide what to buy and when without human intervention.\n“In the future, apps are going to consume services which require payments. Right now, there’s no easy way for agents to actually access all of that,” said Amit Kumar, a partner at Accel.\nKumar has met with dozens of startups in the AI payments space, but he believes Zerbib’s focus on the financial layer for enterprises, rather than consumers, is what’s truly needed to make AI agents work. That’s why Accel is leading Sapiom’s $15 million seed round, with participation from Okta Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Array Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, and Coinbase Ventures.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“If you really think about it, every API call is a payment. Every time you send a text message, it’s a payment. Every time you spin up a server for AWS, it’s a payment,” Kumar told TechCrunch.\nWhile it’s still early days for Sapiom, the startup hopes that its infrastructure solution will be adopted by vibe-coding companies and other companies creating AI agents that will eventually be tasked with doing many things on their own.\nFor example, anyone who has vibe-coded an app with SMS capabilities won’t have to manually sign up for Twilio, add a credit card, and copy an API key into their code. Instead, Sapiom handles all of that in the background, and the person building the micro-app will be charged for Twilio’s services as a pass-through fee by Lovable, Bolt, or another vibe-coding platform.\nWhile Sapiom is currently focused on B2B solutions, its technology could eventually empower personal AI agents to handle consumer transactions. The expectation is that individuals will one day trust agents to make independent financial decisions, such as ordering an Uber or shopping on Amazon. While that future is exciting, Zerbib believes that AI won’t magically make people buy more things, which is why he’s focusing on creating financial layers for businesses instead.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

NASA astronauts will be allowed to bring their smartphones to space for the first time, starting with the Crew-12 and Artemis II missions.\nCrew-12 is expected to head to the International Space Station next week, while the highly anticipated Artemis II mission — which will bring humans around the moon for the first time since the 1960s — was delayed until March.\n“We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,” NASA administrator Jared Isaacman wrote on X.\nWith the newest iPhones and Android devices at hand, the crew will be able to be a bit more spontaneous with image and video gathering, meaning that for those of us back home, these upcoming trips to space could end up being some of NASA’s most well-documented journeys yet.\nImagine how cool (or cringe-worthy) it will be if astronauts turn themselves into TikTok stars in zero gravity, or if they take ultra-wide-angle selfies in the spacecraft. For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.\n“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”\nIt makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to Ars Technica.

    "body": "\nSometimes, it can seem like the AI industry is racing to see who can spend the most money on data centers. Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking — traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making more money and spending less — but it’s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.\nIf that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning. \nThe company announced in its earnings on Thursday that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across “AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.” That’s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It’s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren’t so easy to wave away.\nGoogle is close behind. In its earnings on Wednesday, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It’s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.\nMeta, which reported last week, projected $115 billion to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects a measly $50 billion. Microsoft doesn’t have an official projection for 2026 yet, but the most recent quarterly figure was $37.5 billion, which pencils out to roughly $150 billion, assuming it keeps up. It’s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella — but it still puts the company in third place.\nFrom within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren’t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.\nCrucially, this isn’t just a problem for companies like Meta that haven’t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It’s everyone — even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestor sentiment isn’t everything — and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry’s mind. If you believe AI is about to change everything (and the argument is pretty compelling at this point), you’d be a fool to change course just because Wall Street got jumpy. But going forward, Big Tech companies will be under a lot of pressure to downplay how expensive their AI ambitions really are.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThe AI investing boom (or perhaps bubble) is something Silicon Valley has seen many times before: a gold rush of VC money thrown at the Big New Thing. But one aspect of it is completely unique to these times: startups rocketing from $0 to as much as $100 million in annual recurring revenue, sometimes in a matter of months.  \nWord on the street is that many a VC won’t even look at a startup that’s not on the ARR superhighway, aiming for $100 million in ARR before their Series A funding round.\nBut Andreessen Horowitz general partner Jennifer Li⁠, who helps oversee many of the firm’s most important AI companies, warns that some of the ARR mania is based on myths. \n“Not all ARR is created equal, and not all growth is equal either,” Li said on an episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast. She said to be especially skeptical of a founder announcing spectacular ARR numbers or growth in a tweet. \nNow, there is a legit, well-recognized term in accounting called annual recurring revenue, which refers to the annualized value of contracted, recurring subscription revenue. Essentially, that’s a guaranteed level of revenue because it comes from customers on a contract. \nBut what many of these founders are tweeting about is really “revenue run rate” —  taking whatever money was paid in a period of time and annualizing it. That’s not the same.  \n“There’s a lot of missing nuances of the business quality, retention, and durability that’s missing in that conversation,” Li warned.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA founder may have just had a killer month of sales, but not every month will necessarily repeat it. Or a startup may have a lot of short-term customers doing pilot programs, so revenue isn’t guaranteed to stick around after the pilot period.\nNormally, such boasts about growth via tweets should be treated for what they are — that is, don’t take everything you read on the internet at face value. \nBut because fast growth is a hallmark of AI startups, such claims are “introducing a lot of anxiety” to inexperienced founders who are now asking how they can also instantly go from zero to $100 million, she said.\nLi’s answer: “You don’t. Sure, it’s a great aspiration, but you don’t have to build a business that way, to only optimize for the top-line growth.” \nShe said a better way to think of it is this: how to grow sustainably, where once customers sign up, they stick around and expand their spend with your company. This can lead to “growing 5x or 10x year-over-year,” said Li, meaning growth from $1 million to between $5 million and $10 million in year one, to between $25 million and $50 million in year two, and so on.\nLi pointed out that this is still “unheard of” levels of growth. If it’s coupled with happy customers — that is, high retention rates — those startups will find investors willing to back them. \nOf course, some of the portfolio companies in Li’s a16z group (the infrastructure team) have hit those kinds of racing ARR numbers: Cursor, ElevenLabs, and Fal.ai. But that growth is tied to “durable businesses,” said Li, adding, “There’s real reasons behind each of them.” \nLi also said that kind of growth comes with its own set of operational problems like hiring. \n“How do we hire, not fast, but the right people who can really jump into this type of speed and culture,” she said. And the answer is: not easily. \nThat means those first 100 people wear a lot of hats and missteps are bound to happen. Last year, Cursor, for instance, angered its customer base with a poorly rolled out pricing change.  \nLi pointed out that other fast-growth startups deal with legal and compliance issues before they have systems in place to, or face new AI-age issues like countering deepfakes. \nSo while lightning-fast growth can be a good problem to have, it’s also a little bit of “be careful what you wish for.” \nListen to the full episode here:\n"

    "body": "\nMeta is testing a stand-alone Vibes app, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. Launched last September, Vibes lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others.\nThink TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every video you come across is AI generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app that launched shortly after Vibes.\n“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”\nThe news was first reported by Platformer. \nMeta says it doesn’t share specific numbers but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a stand-alone app.\nThe tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a stand-alone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.\nVibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.\nMeta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.\nIt’s worth noting that Meta told TechCrunch last week that, in addition to testing new premium subscriptions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’s going to explore subscriptions for AI features, including Vibes.\nAlthough Vibes has been free since its launch, Meta plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. Meta plans to launch these test subscriptions in the coming months. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.” \nSubstack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected.\nIn an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. Best said that Substack has fixed the problem and started an investigation.\n“I’m reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. “I’m incredibly sorry this happened. We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”\nIt’s not clear what exactly the issue was with its systems, and the scope of the data that was accessed. It’s also not yet known why the company took five months to detect the breach, or if it was contacted by hackers demanding a ransom. TechCrunch asked the company for more details, and we will update our story if we hear back.\nSubstack did not say how many users are affected. The company said that it doesn’t have any evidence that users’ data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction.\nOn its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone it reached last March.

Opus 4.5 was only released last November, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.\nPerhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.\n“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.\nOpus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) currently offers. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.\nThe new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.\nWhite told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has launched a new product to help enterprises navigate the world of AI agents, focusing on agent management as critical infrastructure for enterprise AI adoption.\nOn Thursday, AI giant OpenAI announced the launch of OpenAI Frontier, an end-to-end platform designed for enterprises to build and manage AI agents. It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.\nFrontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.\nOpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.\nOpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.\nThe company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according to reporting from The Verge. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.\nAgent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, Agentforce, which the company launched in the fall of 2024. Others have quickly followed. LangChain is a notable player in the space that was founded in 2022 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital.

The company has also announced two notable enterprise deals this year with ServiceNow and Snowflake.\nStill, if OpenAI wants to be a meaningful player in the enterprise space, offering a product like Frontier is a promising step.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAn AI lab called Fundamental emerged from stealth on Thursday, offering a new foundation model to solve an old problem: how to draw insights from the huge quantities of structured data produced by enterprises. By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.\n“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”\nThe idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.\nCalled a large tabular model (LTM) rather than a large language model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on the transformer architecture that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.\nThose differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.\nAs Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to big data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.\n“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”\nThat promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nIn May, AI sales automation startup Clay said it was allowing most of its employees to sell some of their shares at a $1.5 billion valuation. Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.\nSince then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completed a tender offer at the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of $6.6 billion, double its previous value.\nAnd just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of $5 billion, a more than 60% increase from its $3.1 billion valuation announced in August.\nThese secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash-out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for a tiny fraction of its peak $7.7 billion valuation.\nBut there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.\nDuring the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin. In contrast, the recent transactions from Clay, Linear, and ElevenLabs are structured as tender offers that also benefit employees.\nWhile investors these days largely frown upon the outsized founder payouts of the 2021 boom, the current shift toward employee-wide tender offers is viewed far more favorably.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’ve done a lot of tenders, and I haven’t seen any drawbacks yet,” Nick Bunick, a partner at the secondary-focused VC firm NewView Capital, told TechCrunch.\nAs companies stay private longer and talent competition intensifies, allowing employees to turn some of their paper gains into cash can be a powerful tool for recruiting, morale, and retention, he said. “A little liquidity is healthy, and we’ve certainly seen that across the ecosystem.”\nAt the time of Clay’s first tender offer, co-founder Kareem Amin told TechCrunch that the main reason for giving employees a chance to cash out some of their otherwise-illiquid stock was to ensure that “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.”  \nSome fast-growing AI startups are realizing that without offering early liquidity, they risk losing their best talent to public companies or more mature startups like OpenAI and SpaceX, which regularly offer tender sales.\nWhile it’s hard not to see the positive aspects of allowing startup employees to reap cash rewards from their hard work, Ken Sawyer, co-founder and managing partner at secondary firm Saints Capital, pointed to unintended second-order effects of employee tenders. “It is very positive for employees, of course,” he said. “But it enables companies to stay private longer, reducing liquidity for venture investors, which is a challenge for LPs.”\nIn other words, relying on tenders as a long-term substitute for IPOs could create a vicious cycle for the venture ecosystem. If limited partners don’t see cash returns, they will be more reluctant to back the very VC firms that invest in startups.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFusion power’s biggest question remains unanswered: How do you ensure the cost to start the fusion reaction isn’t higher than the price at which you can sell the power?\nPlenty of people have ideas, but no one has cracked it yet. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned on until next year, leaving the question unanswered for now.\nOther companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, including Pacific Fusion. Today the company announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratories that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.\nFusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.\nPacific Fusion is chasing an approach known as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to the experiments carried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy. \nBut where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.\n“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kick-start to work properly. To create conditions in the fuel pellet hot enough for fusion, researchers have been using both lasers and magnets to warm it up beforehand. “It’s just a little bit of energy just to give it a little bit of a boost before you compress it,” LeChien said, on the order of 5% to 10% of the total energy. \nBut the added lasers and magnets add upfront complexity, cost, and maintenance requirements to the machine, making it that much harder to sell power at competitive prices.\nSo in the experiments at Sandia, Pacific Fusion tweaked the design of the cylinder encasing the fuel pellet and adjusted the electrical current delivered to it. Before the big pulse of electricity that ignites the fusion reaction, the company allowed a bit of the magnetic field to leak through to the fuel before compressing it, warming it in the process. \n“We can make very subtle changes to how this cylinder is manufactured that allow the magnetic field to leak or to seep into the fuel before it’s compressed,” LeChien said.\nPacific Fusion’s fuel is loaded in a plastic target that’s wrapped in aluminum. By varying the thickness of the aluminum, the company can adjust how much of the magnetic field makes its way to the fuel. The casing needs to be manufactured with some precision, but nothing crazy, LeChien said — something on the order of what’s required for a .22 caliber bullet casing. “That’s a process that’s been honed and manufactured and perfected over 100-plus years,” he added.\nThe tweaks don’t significantly change how much energy Pacific Fusion needs to deliver to the target. “It doesn’t take much energy to actually allow that magnetic field into the center of the fuel,” he said. “It’s a tiny fraction, much less than 1%. It’s a very, very, very small fraction of the overall energy in the system, so it’s effectively unnoticeable.”\nEliminating the magnetic system would simplify the system and its maintenance requirements, which would have a modest effect on overall cost, he said. But getting rid of the laser would cut costs significantly. “The scale of laser [needed] to preheat these types of systems at high gain is north of $100 million.”\nLeChien said experiments like this also help refine the company’s simulations to ensure they’re in agreement with what happens in the real world. “A lot of people have simulated things and said, ‘Oh, this will work or that will work,’” he said. “It’s a very different game to simulate something, build it, test it, and have it work. Closing that loop is hard.” \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "ElevenLabs CEO argued at Web Summit Qatar that voice is the next interface for AI, as OpenAI, Google, and Apple push conversational systems into wearables, new hardware, and everyday interactions.",
    "body": "\nElevenLabs co-founder and CEO Mati Staniszewski says voice is becoming the next major interface for AI – the way people will increasingly interact with machines as models move beyond text and screens.\nSpeaking at Web Summit in Doha, Staniszewski told TechCrunch voice models like those developed by ElevenLabs have recently moved beyond simply mimicking human speech — including emotion and intonation — to working in tandem with the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology. \nIn the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”\nThat vision fueled ElevenLabs’s $500 million raise this week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry. OpenAI and Google have both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies through acquisitions like Q.ai. As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development. \nIconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”\nAnd as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users. \nStaniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making interactions feel more natural and requiring less effort from users. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat evolution, he added, will influence how voice models are deployed. While high-quality audio models have largely lived in the cloud, Staniszewski said ElevenLabs is working toward a hybrid approach that blends cloud and on-device processing — a move aimed at supporting new hardware, including headphones and other wearables, where voice becomes a constant companion rather than a feature you decide when to engage with. \nElevenLabs is already partnering with Meta to bring its voice technology to products, including Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company’s virtual-reality platform. Staniszewski said he would also be open to working with Meta on its Ray-Ban smart glasses as voice-driven interfaces expand into new form factors. \nBut as voice becomes more persistent and embedded in everyday hardware, it opens the door to serious concerns around privacy, surveillance, and how much personal data voice-based systems will store as they move closer to users’ daily lives — something companies like Google have already been accused of abusing.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

It also comes at a time when Toyota, and the rest of the automotive industry, is trying to navigate the effects of tariffs and the end of federal tax credits for EVs.\nThe capital will be spread among five of Toyota’s factories in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Missouri, and will largely focus on adding new production lines for components used in hybrid vehicles.\nAbout $125 million will be spent to enable the production of a hybrid-electric Toyota Corolla, the first of this model to be assembled in the United States. The largest chunk, about $453 million, will go toward expanding production of 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles, and rear motor components (called stators) at Toyota’s Buffalo, West Virginia, plant.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

The firm also has a $15 billion fund to invest in AI anchored by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital. TWG previously invested in a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI and Palantir to sell AI agents to enterprises.  \nNow it’s backing Lambda, which operates a number of U.S. AI data centers. Lambda is a CoreWeave competitor, although it also sells its “AI factories” to hyperscaler clouds. Earlier this month, Lambda announced a multibillion-dollar deal to supply Microsoft with AI infrastructure using tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs. (Nvidia is an investor in Lambda as well.) \nRemember that Microsoft had a similar deal with CoreWeave and had bought about $1 billion worth of services from the company in 2024, its largest customer last year by a mile. Then OpenAI swooped in and signed a $12 billion deal with CoreWeave in March. \nMeanwhile, deal watchers have been talking for months about Lambda looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a valuation north of $4 billion. There was also talk of an IPO. Prior to this, Lambda raised a $480 million Series D in February, with an estimated valuation of $2.5 billion, according to PitchBook.  \nLambda’s $1.5 billion raise far outstrips those earlier whispers of what it was seeking. Whether its valuation also soared, we can’t confirm and Lambda declined to comment on that.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

Boasberg pointed to apps like TikTok as evidence that Meta has competition.\n“The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote in his memorandum opinion. “While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n"

    "body": "\nAfter primarily focusing on private conversations since its founding, Snapchat is embracing public conversations with a new “Topic Chats” feature. The social network says the feature lets users chat about what’s happening in the world and across various communities, from Formula 1 to the reality TV show “Below Deck.”\nProfiles will remain private to anyone you’re not friends with, helping prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages, Snapchat says. While a user’s display name will be visible next to their message, others won’t be able to tap through to their profile from a Topic Chat, the company told TechCrunch in an email. And unlike usernames, display names can’t be used to search for someone.\nSnapchat told TechCrunch that it will use LLM technology and other safety measures to moderate Topic Chats to keep them safe and appropriate. Additionally, messages must adhere to Snapchat’s Community Guidelines, and users can report inappropriate messages. The company says it will take action against users who violate its policies, including warning users and blocking accounts.\nUsers will be able to see which Topic Chats their friends have joined, which the company says will make it easier for people to find common interests with others.\nIn addition to messages, Topic Chats will also surface related Spotlight videos, which are the app’s TikTok-like short-form videos. \nUp until now, the only place for public conversations on Snapchat was in Spotlight comments. Snapchat says it was inspired to launch Topic Chats after seeing how its community interacts in public comments, as it wanted to give users a new way to have these conversations. \n“Snapchatters create billions of Snaps every day, sharing moments with friends and family, and as we’ve expanded services like Spotlight, we’ve also found that the Snapchat community loves commenting publicly about trending topics and events,” the company wrote in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUsers in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. will start seeing Topic Chats appear across Snapchat over the coming weeks in Chat shortcuts, in search, in the Stories page, and on Spotlight videos.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, Google released Gemini 3, its latest and most advanced foundation model, which is now immediately available through the Gemini app and AI search interface.\nComing just seven months after the Gemini 2.5 release, the new model is Google’s most capable LLM yet, and an immediate contender for the most capable AI tool on the market. The release also comes less than a week after OpenAI released GPT 5.1, and a mere two months after Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 — a reminder of the blistering pace of frontier model development.\nA more research-intensive version of the model, called Gemini 3 Deepthink, will also be made available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks, once it passes further rounds of safety testing.\n“With Gemini 3, we’re seeing this massive jump in reasoning,” said Tulsee Doshi, Google’s head of product for the Gemini model. “It’s responding with a level of depth and nuance that we haven’t seen before.”\nSome of that reasoning power is already registering on independent benchmarks. With a score of 37.4, the model marked the highest score on record on the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, meant to capture general reasoning and expertise. The previous high score, held by GPT-5 Pro, was 31.64. Gemini 3 also topped the leaderboard on LMArena, a human-led benchmark that measures user satisfaction.\nAccording to Google, the Gemini app currently has more than 650 million monthly active users, and 13 million software developers have used the model as part of their workflow.\nAlongside the base model, Google also released a Gemini-powered coding interface called Google Antigravity, allowing for multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0. Specifically, Antigravity combines a ChatGPT-style prompt window with a command-line interface and a browser window that can show the impact of the changes made by the coding agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The agent can work with your editor, across your terminal, across your browser to make sure that it helps you build that application in the best way possible,” said DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nIndian edtech startup Physics Wallah ended its first day as a public company on a high, with its shares closing 44% higher than they were listed for, indicating that the country’s edtech sector may still recover after years of gloom.\nPriced at ₹109, the company’s shares climbed as high as ₹161.99 before closing at ₹156.49, valuing it at ₹448 billion (around $5 billion). That’s well above its listing valuation of ₹315 billion (approximately $3.6 billion), and roughly 79% higher than its last private valuation of $2.8 billion in September 2024.\nPhysics Wallah raised ₹34.8 billion (around $393 million) in the IPO. Of this, ₹31 billion (approximately $350.1 million) was through a fresh issue of shares, while ₹3.8 billion (roughly $42.9 million) worth of shares were sold by co-founders Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob, who together held about 80% of the company before the listing.\nThe strong IPO highlights the company’s remarkable growth arc since its humble beginnings as a YouTube channel run by Pandey in 2016. It now stands out in an industry otherwise reeling from layoffs, a funding drought, and the unraveling of once-high-flying rival Byju’s. Today, the company offers test-preparation and upskilling courses via its website, apps, and offline centers.\nThe company’s rise comes as its larger rivals struggle to operate. Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup at $22 billion, was engulfed in a corporate-governance crisis, has been fighting legal battles with lenders, and is dealing with a severe cash crunch that has forced mass layoffs. The Bengaluru-based startup is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings in both India and the U.S.\nUnacademy, another high-profile edtech, has also sharply scaled back operations and cut staff, and is reported to be in talks to be acquired by upskilling platform UpGrad for $300 to $400 million — a steep decline from its $3.44 billion valuation in 2021.\nIn the financial year 2025, Physics Wallah said its revenue increased 49% to ₹28.9 billion (approximately $326 million) from a year earlier, while its net loss narrowed to ₹2.4 billion (roughly $27.5 million) from ₹11.31 billion (about $127.7 million). Online channels accounted for 48.6% of operating revenue, while offline centers contributed 46.8%. The company also reported a 4.5 million paying subscribers, a 23% increase from last year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s a good milestone to have the IPO coming our way,” said Pandey during the company’s IPO ceremony in Mumbai. “But the mission and vision are a lot to be left to be completed.”\nPhysics Wallah plans to deploy most of its IPO proceeds into expanding its offline centers, strengthening its technology stack, and funding potential acquisitions. The company has already aggressively expanded its offline footprint and currently operates 303 centers across 152 cities in India and the Middle East as of June 2025, up from 182 last year.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMonarch Tractor has been accused of overpromising on the autonomous capabilities of its tractors, according to a new lawsuit.\nBurks Tractor, a dealership located in Idaho, has sued Monarch for breach of contract and allegedly violating its warranty because the California-based startup’s tractors were “unable to operate autonomously.” The dealership also says the 10 tractors it purchased “continue to experience significant problems,” and calls them “defective.” \nMonarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa and a lawyer for the company did not respond to a request for comment. Monarch has denied the allegations in a court filing.\nThe previously unreported lawsuit, which was filed in September in Idaho state court and has since moved to federal court, is the latest trouble for Monarch.\nThe company has spent a few years trying to get its tractors — which are electric and supposed to be autonomous, or as Monarch calls it, “driver optional” — to catch on at wineries and dairy farms. But it’s gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the last two years. The Ohio factory where its tractors were being built by Foxconn is now being renovated into an AI data center, and Monarch has been trying to pivot to software and tech licensing.\nBurks Tractor says in its complaint that it purchased the 10 tractors from Monarch in early 2024 with the intent of being one of the California startup’s first dealers. During those negotiations, Burks Tractor claims Monarch “expressly represented” the tractors would be fully autonomous, and the autonomy features “were not limited by location or time.”\nMonarch even provided demo videos to Burks Tractor that showed the equipment performing autonomous tasks, according to the complaint. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBurks Tractor paid Monarch $773,088 for the tractors and financed the purchase, according to the lawsuit, meaning it is still paying interest. The dealer also purchased spare parts. Monarch delivered the first five tractors in April 2024 and the remaining five in June 2025.\nThe lawsuit claims that problems began right away.\n“Upon receiving the tractors, Burks Tractor discovered that the tractors did not perform as represented and were unable to operate autonomosly,” according to the complaint. The dealer flagged this to Monarch, and the startup’s sales team “worked with Burks Tractor to try to make the autonomous tractors work autonomously,” but failed. \nBurks Tractor claims Monarch’s sales team then admitted “both verbally and in writing” the tractors’ autonomy “was limited and the tractors were unable to function autonomously indoors.” The dealer then claims it went “months without any support or follow-up to make the autonomous tractors work as promised,” despite “numerous attempts” to have Monarch “repair or replace the defective tractors.”\n“[T]he tractors continue to experience significant problems and do not operate autonomously,” the dealer claims in the lawsuit. Burks Tractor “demanded Monarch take back the defective tractors, but Monarch has refused to do so.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nThe Jeep Recon, an all-electric SUV with an estimated 250 miles of range, is here, and I couldn’t be more surprised. Here’s why.\nThree years ago, Jeep unveiled how it was reshaping its portfolio with the launch of three EVs — two of which were bound for the North American market by 2024. The all-electric Jeep Recon and Wagoneer S models were part of the brand’s plan to dominate to the electrified SUV market. At the time, parent company Stellantis was aiming for EVs to make up half of Jeep’s sales in North America — and all of its sales in Europe — by 2030.\nThe Wagoneer S eventually came to market in early 2025, while the Jeep Recon remained in limbo. \nMeanwhile, most automakers, including Stellantis, which also owns Chrysler and Ram, began to backpedal on ambitious EV plans as demand failed to meet lofty forecasts. In September, Ram canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup, opting to focus on bringing an extended-range Ram 1500 REV to market. A month later, Stellantis announced it would invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO. But this time, the electrification was not the centerpiece of the multi-billion-dollar commitment.\nAnd yet, the Jeep Recon — with its Wrangler vibes — has survived. \nThe Trail Rated 2026 Jeep Recon. Image Credits: Stellantis/Jeep\nThe company revealed that the 2026 Jeep Recon, with a starting price of $65,000 (not including the $1,995 destination fee), will go into production next year at the Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico. It will initially launch in the U.S. and Canada, followed by a global expansion.\nThe Recon is a four-wheel-drive EV that carries the “Trail Rated” badge, an off-roading term that carries some weight among enthusiasts.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, the EV comes standard with the brand’s Selec-Terrain traction management system, underbody protection, tow hooks, off-road tires, and e-locker axle technology that allows drivers to flip a switch and electronically lock the differential to ensure torque goes to both rear wheels — another handy off-road feature.\n“With the Jeep Recon, we’re proving that electrification isn’t just compatible with off-road excellence, it can elevate it, delivering instant torque, precision control and a quieter, more connected driving experience that’s uniquely Jeep,” brand CEO Bob Broderdorf said in a statement.\nThe company also announced Tuesday it is adopting the North American Charging System for select EVs, including the Jeep Recon. The NACS system will not be integrated into the Jeep Recon, however. Owners will need a NACS adapter to access thousands of Tesla supercharging stations.\nThe 2026 Jeep Recon interior. Image credits: Stellantis/Jeep\nThe powertrain, which includes a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack, delivers 650 horsepower and 620 pound-feet of torque — a powerful combination for off-roading. It also accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour acceleration in 3.6 seconds. Why one would want that in a Jeep is one of my lingering questions.\nBut the larger question — and one that won’t be answered until the vehicle comes to market — is whether SUV-loving Americans buy it, especially when the base version of its iconic 2026 Wrangler starts at about $49,895.\nPerhaps that notable torque and power, slick interior that includes a 14.5-inch horizontal touchscreen (the largest ever for a Jeep), coupled with classic features, including the Wrangler-inspired LED taillamps, a swing gate, and removable doors will do the trick.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The social network said it will also give users badges for controlling their TikTok usage.\nThe company is redesigning its screen time management page and adding new features to it. These include an affirmation journal with more than 120 positive prompts that let users set your intent for the day, a sound generator that can play calming sounds like rain or ocean waves, and a breathing exercise module. The company said that the page will also feature content from creators who talk about limiting screen time, using parental tools, and customizing their feeds.\nTikTok is also debuting new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens. The company said it reviewed academic literature on digital well-being and found that overly restrictive tools can have a negative effect on teens.\nImage Credits: TikTok\nTo earn these badges, users need to complete different missions. Users can complete the sleep hours mission by avoiding using the platform at night. They can also use the new meditation tools to get a badge. TikTok is also rewarding people who set a daily screen time limit and use the app within those bounds with a badge. There are other badges for viewing the weekly screen time report and inviting others to complete these missions.\nThe company said that during its early testing, it observed that more people visited the new well-being screen compared to the previous version of the screen time menu, with the affirmation journal being the most popular tool.\nTikTok said it will display a link to these tools when someone is using the app at night or when they hit their daily screen time limit.\nThe company launched new parental control tools in July, giving guardians the ability to block certain accounts and get notifications when teens upload a public video or a story.

    "body": "\nTesla received a ride-hailing permit this week from Arizona regulators, opening the door for the automaker to begin operating a robotaxi service in the state.\nA spokesperson with Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) told TechCrunch the automaker applied for a Transportation Network Company (TNC) permit on November 13. Tesla met the requirements to operate as a TNC and is permitted as of November 17, according to ADOT.\nThe permit is the final regulatory step to launch a robotaxi service in Arizona, a state that has become a hub of autonomous vehicle technology testing and development. Waymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving company and the dominant robotaxi provider in the U.S., has operated a service in the Phoenix area since 2018. Today, Waymo robotaxis cover a service area of 315 square miles in the greater Phoenix metro area. \nUnder Arizona state law, companies apply and then follow a self-certification process to test autonomous vehicles with or without a driver. But that doesn’t allow the company to operate a robotaxi service that charges for rides. Any company that wants to operate a ride-hailing service, human or robot driven, must apply for a Transportation Network Company permit. \nIn June, Tesla contacted the Arizona Department of Transportation regarding autonomous vehicle ride-sharing services to begin the certification process. The company expressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area, a spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time. \nTesla later applied for both autonomous vehicle testing/operating with a driver and testing/operating without a driver. Tesla went through Arizona’s self-certification process in September to test autonomous vehicles, an ADOT spokesperson confirmed.\nArizona is among several states Tesla CEO Elon Musk has targeted for the company’s robotaxi service. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn June, Tesla launched a limited robotaxi service in South Austin. While the service has grown, the company still has a human safety operator sitting in the passenger seat. \nTesla also launched a pseudo-ride-hailing service in California, although it lacks the proper permits to operate a commercial robotaxi service in the state. Instead, the company, which has a permit to operate a charter service, uses employees driving Tesla Model Y vehicles equipped with its advanced driving assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, to pick up riders.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nHugging Face co-founder and CEO Clem Delangue says we’re not in an AI bubble, but an “LLM bubble” — and it may be poised to pop. At an Axios event on Tuesday, the entrepreneur behind the popular AI platform and community site agreed that bubble talk is today’s “trillion-dollar question,” but said he doesn’t believe AI’s future is at risk if the bubble bursts.\nInstead, as Delangue sees it, it’s large language models (LLMs) — like those powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and other chatbots — that are receiving outsized attention, and that attention may not last.\n“I think we’re in an LLM bubble, and I think the LLM bubble might be bursting next year,” explained Delangue. “But ‘LLM’ is just a subset of AI when it comes to applying AI to biology, chemistry, image, audio, [and] video. I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years,” he noted.\nOne issue, he argued, is that LLMs aren’t the right solution for everything, and smaller, more specialized models will see increased adoption in the future. \n“I think all the attention, all the focus, all the money, is concentrated into this idea that you can build one model through a bunch of compute and that is going to solve all problems for all companies and all people,” said Delangue. “I think the reality is that you’ll see in the next few months, next few years, kind of like a multiplicity of models that are more customized, specialized, that are going to solve different problems.”\nAs an example, he suggested the use case of a banking customer chatbot. \n“You don’t need it to tell you about the meaning of life, right? You can use a smaller, more specialized model that is going to be cheaper, that is going to be faster, that maybe you’re going to be able to run on your infrastructure as an enterprise, and I think that is the future of AI,” Delangue pointed out. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Hugging Face founder admitted that an LLM bubble bursting could impact his company to some extent, but noted that the AI industry is so big that it’s already diversified. That means even if a portion of the industry is overvalued, like LLMs, it’s not going to have a massive impact on the AI field itself or his business.\nPlus, he noted, Hugging Face still has half of the $400 million it has raised in the bank. This cautious approach to spending represents a different strategy from what other AI companies are doing these days, especially in the LLM space.\n“In AI standards, that’s called profitability because the other guys — it’s not hundreds of millions that they’re spending. It’s obviously billions of dollars,” he said. \nBy comparison, Hugging Face is taking a more capital-efficient approach. \n“I think a lot of people right now are rushing — or maybe even panicking — and taking a really short-term approach to things. I’ve been in AI for 15 years now, so I’ve seen some of the cycles,” Delangue added. “And so we’re learning from that and trying to build a long-term, sustainable, impactful company for the world.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration announced Tuesday it would provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island.\nThe energy company said last year it would reopen the reactor, which had been shuttered since 2019, after Microsoft committed to purchasing all the electricity from the 835 megawatt power plant for two decades. Constellation estimated the project would cost $1.6 billion, and it expects to complete the refurbishment in 2028. \nTerms of Microsoft’s deal with Constellation weren’t disclosed. Analysts at Jefferies have estimated the tech company might be paying about $110 to $115 per megawatt-hour over 20 years of the deal. \nThat’s cheaper than a brand-new nuclear power plant would cost, but it’s a hefty premium over wind, solar, and geothermal, according to a comparison of energy costs from Lazard. Even wind and solar projects outfitted with utility-scale batteries to enable 24/7 power are cheaper.\nNonetheless, tech companies have recently fallen in love with nuclear as power demands for their data centers and AI efforts have skyrocketed. This summer, Microsoft competitor Meta signed its own deal with Constellation, buying the “clean energy attributes” of a 1.1 gigawatt nuclear power plant in Illinois.\nThe reactor at Three Mile Island that’s being restarted isn’t the infamous Unit 2, which melted down in 1979. Rather, it’s Unit 1, which was commissioned in 1974 and taken offline in 2019 as cheap natural gas eroded its profitability.\nThe debt facility is being made through the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which was formed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to foster the growth of clean energy technologies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe LPO is most famous for its loan to Solyndra, a U.S. solar startup that went belly-up during the Great Recession. Overall, though, experts consider the LPO a success, with a default rate of 3.3% after recoveries. Tesla, for instance, received a $465 million loan under the program in 2010 and paid it back by 2013.\nLast month, the LPO finalized a $1.6 billion loan to American Electric Power, using federal dollars to support the upgrade of around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which passed during the Biden administration, created another pot of money under the LPO known as the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program.  That program was created to restore existing power plants to operation provided they avoid or reduce pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration kept it largely in tact, rebranding it the Energy Dominance Financing Program.\nIn its press release, the Department of Energy, perhaps erroneously, says the the EDF Program was created under the Working Families Tax Cut Act. It was instead authorized under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "description": "Sphere helps automate registration, calculation, filing, and remittance obligations for companies. “We help companies collect tax on customer transactions,” Nicholas Rudder said, explaining that companies have to collect tax on purchases and remit it to authorities each month or quarter. ",
    "body": "\nAs Nicholas Rudder built his last startup, an educational marketplace called ScholarSite, he kept running into the same problem: tax.  \n“Marketplaces are liable for tax on their entire GMV (gross merchandise value) not just their take rate, so every new country meant a maze of registrations, filings, deadlines, and risk,” Rudder told TechCrunch. “It became a constant distraction. Instead of building the business, I was spending time deciphering international compliance rules I never wanted to become an expert in.”  \nAs he and co-founder Adrian Sarstedt were looking to shut down ScholarSite (later calling it Sphere), Rudder decided to keep the name but turn the product into something new.  \n“The world was going global, but compliance infrastructure hadn’t kept up,” Rudder said.  \nIn 2023, Rudder alone launched Sphere as a tax software vendor that helps companies stay in compliance as they scale across borders. The company targets Series B to IPO stage companies with a global customer base, Rudder said. \n“We help companies collect tax on customer transactions,” he continued, explaining that companies have to collect tax on purchases and remit it to authorities each month or quarter. \nSphere helps “automate registration, calculation, filing, and remittance obligations for companies,” he said. Sphere spent two years in stealth before officially launching, and clients now include the vibe-coding platforms Lovable and Replit, as well as the AI voice company ElevenLabs.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs an edtech marketplace, it raised a $4.3 million seed. On Tuesday, as a tax platform, Sphere announced a $21 million Series A led by a16z. \nRudder says the product takes less than 24 hours to set up. It has integrations into major billing platforms, like Stripe and Campfire, allowing Sphere to pull a company’s transaction data and assess global tax exposure, he said. Calculating the taxability of a transaction is where Sphere’s AI tax review and assessment model engine comes in, he said — or, in other words, TRAM.  \n“TRAM ingests and codifies the rules in every jurisdiction and creates a set of tax determinations” — like if something can be taxed or not — “along with reasoning and backing citations for that determination,” Rudder, the company’s CEO, explained.  \nSphere’s human team reviews and approves the outputs of TRAM and approves them so that it can be pushed into a tax engine that applies tax to transactions in real time.  \n“That part of the system has no AI so there is zero chance of hallucinations.”  \nSphere also monitors how much tax a company owes in what region, and is integrated directly into more than 100 tax authorities in the world, so companies can register for various tax jurisdictions directly through Sphere.  \n“Once they submit a registration, we send that information to the tax authorities and let the company know when their registration is processed and when they can start collecting tax in that region,” Rudder said.  \nFinally, Sphere helps with filing and remittance. It automatically generates tax returns and submissions, Rudder said, debits back tax returns to its customers’ bank accounts and pays tax authorities. It’s the product he wanted when he was building his first company.  \nOthers in this market include legacy players Anrok and Avalara.  \nAlthough Stripe also has a global tax calculation and collection service, Rudder does not consider Stripe a competitor but a partner.  \n“Sphere is one of only three tax vendors globally with a native integration to Stripe’s Billing and Checkout products,” he said, adding that the company also has use cases that Stripe doesn’t have, such as being able to fulfill the end-to-end compliance life cycle. \nRudder described his funding process as “unintentional.” He said he was looking to raise at the time, but knew he needed to move fast to execute on his ambitions.  \n“When we met a16z and heard what they’d done for similar companies in the compliance and fintech space, we knew they were the right partner,” Rudder said. \nMarc Andrusko, a partner at a16z, said the VC firm first met Rudder back when he was working on ScholarSite. “While we didn’t get all the way to a term sheet for that business, it was clear Nick had the horsepower, grit, and drive needed to be an exceptional founder,” Andrusko told TechCrunch.  \nA few years later, Andrusko said the team started hearing whispers about how promising a new company called Sphere was becoming. “It took all of five minutes to put together that it was Nick’s new business post-pivot, and we immediately reached out to get the update.”  \nOne aspect of the business that impressed Andrusko was how integrated Sphere was into local geographies.  \n“Whereas both legacy players and many of the more recent venture-backed startup competitors often hand customers off to third-party consulting firms to manage certain geographies, Sphere took the time to build integrations into local rails plus AI automations that allow it to facilitate the entire sales tax compliance process completely end-to-end,” Andrusko said.  \nYC and Felicis Ventures also participated in the round. The fresh capital will be used to build out more infrastructure to connect with more local tax authorities; expand its AI and engineering team, and build out an international sales team. \n“I want this product to be the indispensable tool that finance teams look to when they want to expand into a new market,” Rudder said. “Not just for indirect tax, but for every form of transactional compliance they may not even realize they’re exposed to.”  \nThis piece was updated to clarify that Sarstedt is no longer at the company.\n"

She penned a letter to one of the engineers at Dyson, made a connection, and started testing the idea.  \n“Five years later, following thousands of designs and iterations and extended user testing, we’ve revealed the world’s first smart menstrual cup,” said Button.  \nThe UK-based company has also raised a $9 million (£6.8 million)  seed round, one led by Lunar Ventures as it prepares to officially launch its product next year.  \nThe product functions like a regular menstrual cup — designed to store period blood rather than absorb it. But Emm’s medical-grade silicone is “fitted with ultra-thin, advanced sensor technology.” This sensor gathers data that will help users understand patterns about their cycles. Button hopes that it could “transform the research, diagnosis and treatment of menstrual and reproductive health conditions.”  \nShe isn’t the only one who thinks this way. Other femtech founders told The Guardian a few months ago that menstrual blood was an “overlooked opportunity in women’s health” that could offer insights not available from health tests based on circulatory blood. \nIt could, for instance, help diagnose painful and often misdiagnosed medical conditions like endometriosis.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“One in ten women today suffer from endometriosis,” Button said. “A condition that, like many others in reproductive health, takes an average of seven to ten years to diagnose.” \nThat delay “is largely due to the lack of meaningful data and poor characterization of menstrual health in clinical settings,” Button believes. “There have been no reliable tools to accurately and objectively track that aspect of health until now.” \nBeyond endometriosis, she added that one in three women experiences “severe reproductive health issues” throughout their lives.  \nData gathered from the Emm app is encrypted and stored securely, with two-factor authentication. “It’s also always anonymized or pseudonymized,” meaning personal identifiers are removed or replaced with codes, “and will only be accessed by the people at Emm who genuinely need it,” she said. \nButton used the word “strategic” to describe her funding round and said she connected with her lead investor through her network. Others in the round include Alumni Ventures (who backed Oura), The Labcorp Venture Fund and BlueLion Global. Money will be used to launch the product into the UK market next year, she said, adding that the waitlist has already topped 30,000 pre-orders to go live soon.  \nCapital will also be used for research and development. Button hopes to enter the U.S. market in early 2027.  \n“Menstrual health is only the jumping off point for Emm,” said Button. “Ultimately, I believe we will have a profound impact on women’s health more broadly,” she continued, adding she hopes to expand the product one day, perhaps into diagnosis, other digital care tools, and even therapeutics.  \n“Our mission is to accelerate diagnosis, equip people with the data to advocate for themselves, and ultimately help them take control of their own bodies and health journeys,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tesla has been hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI) for routinely denying or delaying customer claims despite years of warnings from the state regulator, according to <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/release064-2025.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">a new pair of filings</a>.</p>\n<p>Tesla’s insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in “willful unfair claims settlement practices” including “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps” of the process and “unreasonable denials,” CDI wrote. This has allegedly caused “financial harm” and “distress to policyholders.”</p>\n<p>CDI first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings, yet it claims things have only gotten worse. “In 2025, the Tesla Companies have already had more complaints, more justified complaints, and committed more violations than in the three previous years combined,” the regulator wrote. </p>\n<p>Tesla and State National could face penalties up to $5,000 for each “unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act” and up to $10,000 for each “willful” act, according to the filings. The companies have 15 days to respond. </p>\n<p>The enforcement action could have knock-on legal effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/teslas-auto-insurance-arm-hit-with-consumer-class-action-california-2025-07-17/\" target=\"_blank\">company purposely delayed and minimized claim payouts</a>. CDI wrote Friday that Tesla’s actions may have created “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla and State National did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Tesla launched its in-house insurance product in 2019. The idea was to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. But it got off to a rocky start. The website repeatedly crashed, and when it didn’t, it offered quotes that were far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20839607/tesla-car-insurance-broken-high-rate-quotes-california\" target=\"_blank\">higher than owners expected</a>. Still, Musk promised it would be a “revolutionary” product.</p>\n<p>Just three years later, according to CDI’s filings, the regulator noticed a “marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints” against Tesla. So in December 2022, CDI started meeting with Tesla and State National. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The regulator said it learned Tesla’s “Head of Claims” position had been vacant for months. It also accused the companies of not reporting the claims-handling problems.</p>\n<p>As a result, CDI subjected Tesla and State National to a sort of probationary period: the regulator monitored the companies’ efforts to reduce these violations for six months. Tesla and State National “conceded” that they had underestimated the volume of claims and the staffing required to handle them, according to CDI, and promised to beef up hiring.</p>\n<p>It took Tesla until April 2023 to hire a new Head of Claims. Through the rest of that year, Tesla and State National “reported improvements in the quality” of their claims handling and the “resolution of consumer complaints.” </p>\n<p>Later that year, Reuters published <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\">an investigation into Tesla’s insurance arm</a> that showed things weren’t so rosy. </p>\n<p>CDI came to the same realization in 2024. The regulator noticed a “significant increase” in both consumer complaints against Tesla and “violations of the law,” according to the filings. CDI had received just 83 consumer complaints against Tesla in 2022, but in 2024, that number jumped to 829. In 775 of those cases, CDI found Tesla had violated the state’s insurance code.</p>\n<p>Things have only gotten worse, according to CDI. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified 1,969 insurance code violations.</p>\n<p>In total, since 2022, CDI said Tesla has accumulated nearly 3,000 violations of state insurance law. The majority of those violations involve Tesla failing to respond to customers within the mandatory 15-day period. CDI said it identified 166 violations in which Tesla filed to conduct a “thorough, fair, and objective investigation” into a claim.</p>\n<p>“CDI repeatedly notified [Tesla] of its claims-mishandling issues and violations of law,” the regulator wrote. “While [Tesla] repeatedly committed to improvements, the number of justified complaints and violations continued to mount, demonstrating [Telsa’s] failure to correct its practices.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>An app called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/young-minds-app/\">Young Minds</a> wants to give parents control over what their kids do on the internet, while also protecting their children’s privacy and teaching them good online habits. </p>\n<p>The startup was founded by Nino Dvalidze (pictured), an entrepreneur and a mother of two from the United Kingdom. Dvalidze told TechCrunch that the idea for Young Minds came from conversations with fellow parents, who are also worried about how to keep their children safe, while also allowing them to have access to the internet, which, she admitted, is “enormously helpful in terms of education and exploration and connection with so many people outside of your immediate zone of contacts.”  </p>\n<p>Dvalidze explained that Young Minds, which will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>, has two versions: the parent app and the children app. The former gives certain control to the latter, allowing parents to set up screen time limits, to curtail certain content, but not the ability to monitor all communications on their kids’ devices. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">Disrupt runs October 27 to 29 in San Francisco</a>.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing safety as a minimum foundation,” Dvalidze said in a phone call. “We need to make sure that nothing that is not intended for the young eyes can reach them.” </p>\n<p>But the app is also designed to teach kids why certain content is blocked or why something is flagged as risky. Dvalidze said the app scans the child’s use of their tablet or phone with AI to detect and flag potentially harmful content, but the company does not store any user data. Parents can also use an in-app chatbot to educate themselves about the potential risks of certain sites or apps, she said.  </p>\n<p>Young Minds is available on Android. The iOS version will launch next week, but Dvalidze admits that because of iOS’s restrictions on what data apps can access from other apps, the version from Apple devices is a little different, albeit with “workarounds.” </p>\n<p>“We store some information with parent consent and analyze it,” she said, referring to a workaround they use on iOS.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>In terms of controlling screen time, Young Minds can be set up to turn on certain routines, as well as specific modes like “study mode,” which only allows education apps like Duolingo, or “wind down mode,” which restricts apps and usage that could interfere with their sleep.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Agriculture is a thirsty industry, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/water-use-stress\">consuming 70% of all fresh water used worldwide</a>. In some countries, like India or Chile, it can be more than 90%.</p>\n<p>For Mario Bustamante, who lives in Chile, the problem hits close to home. “Lack of water is a big issue here,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Bustamante is betting that AI can help slash water use in farms across the world. His startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/instacrops/\">Instacrops</a>, was originally founded to deploy internet-of-things (IoT) sensors on farms to warn farmers about damaging frost conditions, but as the hardware became commoditized, the company pivoted to software and water use.</p>\n<p>Now, Instacrops is helping 260 farms cut their water use up to 30% while also increasing crop yields by as much as 20%. The company is part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a>, and it will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&display=\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> later this month in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>The switch from hardware to AI turned the company on its head, allowing it to operate with fewer staff and while processing more data. </p>\n<p>“We are processing — more or less — 15 million data points per hour. Almost 10 years ago, that was the amount for a year,” Bustamante said. “We’re reducing cost, team members, and generating more impact with less.”</p>\n<p>Instacrops can install new IoT sensors or connect to a farm’s existing network and collect data from them to advise farmers when to irrigate different areas. The startup’s LLM models ingest more than 80 parameters, including soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, crop yield, and NDVI, a plant productivity metric derived from satellite imagery.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Those advisories are sent to farmers’ mobile phones. Instacrops offers a chatbot app, but it also integrates with WhatsApp. “I think in the next year, we will be 100% WhatsApp because it’s a universal tool for any farmer,” Bustamante said</p>\n<p>On farms that are more technologically advanced, Instacrops can control irrigation systems directly, he said.</p>\n<p>Instacrops is focused on high-value crops in Latin America, including apples, avocados, blueberries, almonds, and cherries. Farmers pay an annual fee per hectare of farmland to gain access to the startup’s irrigation insights.</p>\n<p>The startup was a part of the Y Combinator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/instacrops\">summer 2021 batch</a>, and it has received investments from SVG Ventures and Genesis Ventures. </p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn more about Instacrops, and dozens of other startups, live and in person, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">don’t miss TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>AI coding tools are getting better fast. If you don’t work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 4.5 did it again.  </p>\n<p>At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. If you are using AI to write emails, you’re probably getting the same value out of it you did a year ago. Even when the model gets better, the product doesn’t always benefit — particularly when the product is a chatbot that’s doing a dozen different jobs at the same time. AI is still making progress, but it’s not as evenly distributed as it used to be. </p>\n<p>The difference in progress is simpler than it seems. Coding apps are benefitting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. This is reinforcement learning (RL), arguably the biggest driver of AI progress over the past six months and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\">getting more intricate all the time</a>. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there’s a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input.  </p>\n<p>As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we’re seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can’t. RL-friendly skills like bug-fixing and competitive math are getting better fast, while skills like writing make only incremental progress. </p>\n<p>In short, there’s a reinforcement gap — and it’s becoming one of the most important factors for what AI systems can and can’t do. </p>\n<p>In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn’t break before they deployed it. So even the most elegant code still needs to pass through unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and so on. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\" target=\"_blank\">as Google’s senior director for dev tools recently told me</a>, they’re just as useful for validating AI-generated code. Even more than that, they’re useful for reinforcement learning, since they’re already systematized and repeatable at a massive scale. </p>\n<p>There’s no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. But not every task falls neatly into “easy to test” or “hard to test” categories. We don’t have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some testing kits will work better than others, of course, and some companies will be smarter about how to approach the problem. But the testability of the underlying process is going to be the deciding factor in whether the underlying process can be made into a functional product instead of just an exciting demo.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you’d asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s new Sora 2 model</a> shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Faces hold their shape, looking like a specific person rather than just a collection of features. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nunil1/sora_2_vs_veo_3_on_physics_test_sora_2_is_first/\" target=\"_blank\">obvious</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/pallavmac/status/1973141663557226806\" target=\"_blank\">subtle</a> ways. I suspect that, if you peeked behind the curtain, you’d find a robust reinforcement learning system for each of these qualities. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. </p>\n<p>To be clear, this isn’t a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It’s a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. But as long as RL is the primary tool for bringing AI products to market, the reinforcement gap will only grow bigger — with serious implications for both startups and the economy at large. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career.

And harassing people in general has never changed their mind.” She also alluded to the controversy by posting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2a73ot5uk2e\">a nudge-nudge wink-wink photo of waffles</a>, as did <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jessesingal.com/post/3m2c6nmdr5s2h\">Singal</a>.</p>\n<p>Users continued to criticize her, with Graber firing back — when one compared the criticism to a customer threatening to cancel their service, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7peyfac2t\">she asked</a>, “Are you paying us? Where?” When another suggested that she should apologize, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2cdjn5f3k2t\">Graber said</a>, “You could try a poster’s strike. I hear that works.”</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to dismiss this whole thing as another example of leftist infighting, especially since the Bluesky Discourse has already moved on to the question of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/katelynburns.com/post/3m2h2hpqdss2s\">whether “clanker” is a slur</a>.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Or maybe, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thelouvreof.bsky.social/post/3m2fuwkm3s223\">one satirical account suggested</a>, there’s just been “a week-long gas leak at Bluesky HQ.”</p>\n<p>But the controversy also underlines ongoing tensions between the company and some of its most vocal users. It’s a tension that could be seen last month in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\">skeptical responses to the company’s updated community guidelines</a>, and in recurring complaints that Bluesky has been too quick to ban Palestinian and trans users, while offering leniency to big accounts like Singal’s.</p>\n<p>It may be simplistic to reduce this tension to a single cause, but I suspect much of it comes from differing visions about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">what makes Bluesky special</a>: If you think it’s Bluesky’s community, especially that early community of marginalized users, then it can feel like a betrayal when Bluesky executives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bix.blog/posts/2025-10-03-on-waffles-and-class-allegiance/\">seem unwilling to stand up for those users</a>.</p>\n<p>One user who posts under the name Katie Tightpussy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/katie.bzky.team/post/3m2dyass2kc2x\">speculated</a> that Bluesky leadership has come to loathe “having a large social media app that they never wanted” and suggested that they spin it off so they can return “to Protocol Land where they never have to think about the opinions of plebeians ever again.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, when Graber isn’t responding to criticism with posts about waffles, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jay-graber-bluesky/\">she’s resisted identifying Bluesky with any specific group or political leaning</a>, instead emphasizing the decentralized protocol that allows users to build their own alternatives.</p>\n<p>Amidst the current controversy, she posted about “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2cuifnzds24\">decentralization acceleration</a>” and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7jc3k522t\">wrote</a>, “We’re system architects at core. We built a decentralized network so you could run your own moderation,” then suggested that the company’s “upcoming healthy discourse project is taking some swings at the interaction model that drives these dynamics on Bluesky.”</p>\n<p>Graber may even have foreseen some version of this conflict when Bluesky was starting out with vision of a decentralized system that allows users to migrate elsewhere if they’re unhappy with company leadership. As she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/14/blueskys-quest-to-build-nontoxic-social-media\">reportedly wrote in Bluesky’s founding documents</a>, “The company is a future adversary.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

Sora’s most distinctive feature may be its “cameos,” where users can upload their biometric data to see their digital likeness featured in AI-generated videos.</p>\n<p>At the same time, users also seem to delight in flouting copyright laws by creating videos with popular, studio-owned characters. In some cases, those characters might even criticize the company’s approach to copyright, for example in videos where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">Pikachu and SpongeBob interact with deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1\">a blog post published Friday</a>, Altman said the company is already planning two changes to Sora, first by giving copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls.”</p>\n<p>The key word here appears to be “opt-in,” suggesting that OpenAI will stop users from creating videos with copyrighted characters unless studios and others rightsholders have actually given Sora permission to do so.</p>\n<p>“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Even with this new approach, Altman acknowledged there are likely to be “some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t.”</p>\n<p>The second change he mentioned is some unspecified form of video monetization. The company previously said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its only plan for monetization</a> was to charge users to create extra videos during periods of high demand, and Altman’s blog post seems to elaborate on that idea by acknowledging “we are going to have to somehow make money for video generation.” He also suggesting the revenue could be shared with rightsholders.</p>\n<p>“Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we … want both to be valuable.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The tie between startups and the U.S. government have strengthened in recent years, a shift buoyed by an interest in using AI, automation, space, robotics, and climate tech for defense. And while that has provided another welcome path to capital, the relationship is getting complicated.</p>\n<p>A growing share of startups have the U.S. government as customers, or are aiming for permits and defense-related contracts. When the government is operational, that connection can provide a needed boost and revenue to startups. But when the government ceases to function, as it did starting October 1, those close ties can stifle or even halt progress for startups.</p>\n<p>This week on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\">Equity</a>, Anthony Ha, Max Zeff, and I (Kirsten Korosec) talk about how a prolonged U.S. government shutdown poses more risk for startups than in the past — not to mention put a damper on an active IPO season. The three of us dug into a few other topics too, including the how AI companies are trying to monetize and the U.S. government’s latest push to take ownership stakes in the tech and industrial sectors.</p>\n<p>“This also feels like a reflection of how the startup landscape has changed in say the last decade and especially over the last few years,” Ha said during the Equity podcast, adding the focus was on consumer internet startups for a long time. “Obviously there’s a lot more going on in defense tech, a lot more in deep tech where you maybe need various kinds of regulatory approvals,” he continued. “And so, it feels like much broader swaths of the startup landscape now depend on the government in various ways, in ways that wasn’t necessarily true 10 years ago.”</p>\n<p>But it’s not just startups. The Trump Administration has also continued to extend its reach, and ownership, into the tech industry, too. </p>\n<p>The Trump Administration has renegotiated yet another federal loan — it’s third in recent months followed by one with Intel and rare earth miner MP Materials — and taken an equity stake as part of the newly hashed out deal. </p>\n<p>The U.S. government took a 5% stake in Canadian miner Lithium Americas and another a 5% ownership in a Lithium Americas-GM joint venture to mine lithium in Nevada. The equity stakes will be acquired through no-cost warrants, which are financial instruments that give the government the right to purchase shares at a set price.

    "description": "The event planning startup, which has raised over $27M from a16z and others, fixed the bug after TechCrunch found that Partiful was not removing granular location data from users' profile photos.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Social event planning app Partiful, which calls itself “Facebook events for hot people,” has firmly replaced Facebook as the go-to platform for sending party invitations. But what Partiful also has in common with Facebook is that it’s collecting a tsunami of user data, and Partiful could have done better at keeping that data secure.</p>\n<p>On Partiful, hosts can create online invitations with a retro, maximalist vibe, allowing guests to RSVP to events with the ease of ordering a salad on a touch-screen. Partiful aims to be user-friendly and trendy, propelling the app to #9 on the iOS App Store’s Lifestyle charts. Google called Partiful the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/partiful-is-googles-best-app-of-2024/\">best app</a>” of 2024. </p>\n<p>Now, Partiful has evolved into a powerful Facebook-like social graph, easily mapping who your friends are and who your friends’ friends are, what you do, where you go, and all of your phone numbers.</p>\n<p>As Partiful grew more popular, some users became skeptical of the company’s origins. One New York City promoter announced that it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/wait-partifuls-founders-worked-at-palantir.html\">boycotting Partiful</a> because its founders and some staff are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-mafia-former-employees-startups-anduril-2025-3\">former employees of Palantir</a>, Peter Thiel’s data mining company, which produces the software that powers ICE’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.404media.co/this-is-palantirs-justification-for-building-ices-master-database/\">master database</a> for the Trump administration’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">deportation crackdown</a>.</p>\n<p>Given some of the speculation around the app, TechCrunch set up a new account and tested Partiful. We soon found that the app was not stripping the location data of user-uploaded images, including public profile photos.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch found it was possible for anyone, using only the developer tools in a web browser, to access raw user profile photos stored in Partiful’s backend database hosted on Google Firebase. If the user’s photo contained the precise real-world location of where it was taken, anyone else could have also viewed the precise coordinates of where that photo was taken.</p>\n<p>Almost all digital files, like the pictures you take on a smartphone, contain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#metadata\">metadata</a>, which includes information like the file size, when it was created, and by whom. In the case of photos and videos, metadata can include information about the kind of camera used and its settings, as well as the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of where the image was captured.</p>\n<p>The security flaw is problematic because anyone using Partiful could have revealed the location of where a person’s profile photo was snapped. Some Partiful user profile photos contained highly granular location data that could be used to identify the person’s home or work, particularly in rural areas where individual homes are easier to distinguish on a map.</p>\n<p>It’s common practice for companies that host user images and videos to automatically remove metadata upon upload to prevent privacy lapses like this. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch verified the bug ourselves by uploading a new Partiful profile photo that we had previously captured from outside of the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco, which contained the photo’s precise location. When we checked the metadata of the photo stored on Partiful’s server, it still contained the exact coordinates of where the image was taken down to a few feet.</p>\n<p>After discovering the security flaw, TechCrunch alerted Partiful co-founders Shreya Murthy and Joy Tao by email, as Partiful does not have a public means for reporting security flaws. TechCrunch shared a link to a Partiful user’s raw profile photo containing that user’s real-world location at the time the photo was taken, a residential address in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Tao told TechCrunch on Friday that the vulnerability was “already on our team’s radar, and was recently prioritized as an upcoming fix.” </p>\n<p>Partiful initially provided a timeline to fix the flaw by “next week,” but given the sensitivity of the data involved, TechCrunch requested the fix by Friday. Partiful confirmed it fixed the bug on Saturday.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch found by Saturday that metadata was removed from existing user-uploaded photos. The profile photo that we uploaded with our real-world location also had the metadata removed. </p>\n<p>Partiful disclosed the security lapse in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/partiful/status/1974485503702376494\">a tweet</a> shortly before the publishing of this story.</p>\n<p>When asked by TechCrunch if Partiful has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if there was any direct or bulk access to user profile photos stored in its database, Partiful spokesperson Jess Eames said this was “still under investigation but we have found no evidence of this yet.”</p>\n<p>Eames said the company “regularly perform security reviews with experts in the field, not just as a one-time action but as part of our ongoing processes.” Partiful did not provide TechCrunch with the name of the experts when asked.</p>\n<p>Partiful has raised over $27 million from investors since its founding in 2022, including a $20 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. TechCrunch asked Partiful’s co-founders if they had commissioned a security review of their product before launch, but they would not say.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI is gearing up to host its third annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.</p>\n<p>From the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/\">building an AI device</a>, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">social media app</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/\">an AI-powered browser</a> to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.</p>\n<p>At the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Anthropic’s and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.</p>\n<p>OpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/openai-launches-gpt-4-turbo-and-launches-fine-tuning-program-for-gpt-4/\">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/app-store-for-ai-build-your-own-gpt-and-sell-it-on-openais-gpt-store/\">the GPT Store</a>. Altman was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/sam-altman-is-out-as-openais-ceo/\">ousted as CEO</a> days later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/openais-devday-brings-realtime-api-and-other-treats-for-ai-app-developers/\">API for AI voice applications</a>, but not much else.</p>\n<p>Nothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched last year.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here’s what you need to know about OpenAI’s DevDay, and how to watch it.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>DevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he’s scheduled to unveil “announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.” The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/OpenAI\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s YouTube page</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.</p>\n<p>For in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.</p>\n<p>There’s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”</p>\n<p>Later in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won’t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.</p>\n<p>At 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a “Developer State of the Union” with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to “demo new capabilities” and share what’s ahead for developers.</p>\n<p>Finally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a “Closing Fireside Chat” to discuss the “craft of building in the age of AI.” That conversation will last about 45 minutes.</p>\n<p><em>Update 10/3/25: OpenAI updated the attendee list for DevDay 2025.

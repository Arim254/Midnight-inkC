The company on Monday said the Apple TV app for Android will now support Google Cast functionality, which lets users stream videos and audio directly to their TV.\nThe tech giant’s adoption of Google Cast signals its interest in making Apple TV a more competitive streaming service at a time when the market is seeing increased consolidation. Netflix and Paramount are fighting to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney is preparing to merge Hulu into its own streaming app.\n\nThe feature is arriving just after Netflix quietly abandoned support for Google Cast in its own app, angering many subscribers. Apple’s support for the feature could potentially attract Android users upset by Netflix’s decision who choose to move their streaming dollars elsewhere.\nApple TV’s lineup of original content is smaller than what other streaming services offer, but it still features a number of popular shows and films like “Severance,” “Pluribus,” “The Studio,” “The Morning Show,” “Slow Horses,” and the recent summer blockbuster, “F1.” For sports, Apple TV offers live-streamed “Friday Night Baseball” doubleheaders, plus Major League Soccer matches, and Formula 1 races in the U.S.\nTo cast to their TV, users will need to install the Apple TV app from Google Play, which works on smartphones, tablets, and foldables. Just tap the Cast icon in the top right.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n"

The company signed the partnership with OpenAI last week that will bring its iconic characters to the AI firm’s Sora video generator. Once that exclusive year is up, Disney is free to sign similar deals with other AI companies.\nThe deal gives OpenAI a high-profile content partner, allowing users to draw on more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to create content on Sora. For now, it’s the only AI platform that’s legally permitted to do so.\nFor Disney, the deal offers a way to test the waters with generative AI and its intellectual property, letting the company assess how its partnership with OpenAI goes before pursuing additional agreements.\n“No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don’t intend to try,” Iger told CNBC. “We’ve always felt that if it’s going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.”\nTellingly, the same day that Disney announced its deal with OpenAI, the company sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights. Google didn’t confirm or deny Disney’s allegations but did say it will “engage” with the company.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n"

The 25-year-old venture firm announced Monday that it raised a total of $9 billion in fresh funds, the largest fundraise in firm’s history.\nAt a time when very few companies have managed to IPO, Lightspeed was an early investor in Rubrik, Netskope, and Navan, all of which have recently made their public market debuts.\nThe firm has also positioned itself as a predominantly AI-focused investor. Lightspeed claims to have backed 165 AI-native companies, including Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Mistral, Glean, Abridge, and Skild AI.\nArmed with its giant new fund, the firm can continue to make massive investments into capital-intensive AI companies. For instance, Lightspeed reportedly wrote a $1 billion check to Anthropic when it co-led the LLM-maker’s $13 billion investment in September.\nLightspeed’s new capital is spread across six funds, including a $3.3 billion opportunity fund dedicated to follow-on investments in its fastest-growing portfolio companies.\nOther large VC firms that have recently raised enormous capital pools include Founders Fund, which earlier this year amassed $4.6 billion for a growth fund, as well as General Catalyst’s $8 billion capital haul and Andreessen Horowitz’s $7.2 billion, both secured in 2024.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, younger and smaller VC firms are struggling to attract fresh funds.

Other participants include Menlo Ventures, OpenAI, Dimension, Thrive Capital, Neo, Yosemite venture fund, Lachy Groom, SV Angel, and new investors Glade Brook and Emerson Collective. The firm’s total funding now stands at over $225 million.\nThe company is one in a growing industry that sees AI as a faster route toward drug development. In August, Menlo Ventures announced it was leading Chai’s $70 million Series A round. The investor described Chai as a startup that was building foundation models tuned for drug discovery, specifically to predict interactions between biochemical molecules so they could be reprogramed for cures.\nChai says that its ambition is to “build the ‘computer-aided design suite’ for molecules.” Last year, the startup announced the Chai 1 AI model and is now offering Chai 2, it’s latest model. The company says Chai 2 is achieving significant improvements in success rates over other methods for de novo antibody design, meaning building custom antibodies from scratch, not modifying existing ones.\n“Our latest models can design molecules that have properties we’d want from actual drugs, and tackle challenging targets that have been out of reach,” Josh Meier, Chai’s co-founder and CEO said in a prepared statement. \nPreviously, Meier, whose background is in machine learning, worked in research and engineering at Facebook and, prior to that, worked for OpenAI, according to his LinkedIn.

    "body": "\nThe hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which includes members of a gang known as ShinyHunters, said it is attempting to extort porn site Pornhub, after claiming to have stolen personal information belonging to the website’s premium members. \nOn Friday, Pornhub confirmed it was among several companies affected by an earlier breach at the widely used web and mobile analytics provider Mixpanel, which exposed unspecified “analytics events” of some Pornhub Premium users.\nOn Monday, Bleeping Computer reported seeing a sample of the stolen Pornhub data, which included personal information associated with PornHub Premium members, including their registered email addresses and location; activity type, such as which videos and channels they watched, including the video name and web address; keywords associated with the video; and the date and time that the event was recorded.\nMixpanel chief executive Jen Taylor did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. A Pornhub spokesperson, who did not provide their full name, did not answer questions sent by TechCrunch about the incident, referring us instead to the company’s published statement. \nA spokesperson for the ShinyHunters gang told TechCrunch that the hackers have sent an extortion email only to Pornhub so far, and declined to say how many other companies were part of the Mixpanel incident. \nRight before the U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving, Mixpanel revealed a breach that it discovered on November 8, which affected its corporate customers, without saying which ones, nor how they were affected. OpenAI later confirmed it was one of those affected customers, as well as CoinTracker and SwissBorg. \nAccording to Mixpanel’s website, the company has around 8,000 customers, with each customer having potentially millions of users whose data was taken in the breach.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about the Mixpanel breach? Such as what companies were affected? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nThe type of data stolen likely depends on how each customer configured their Mixpanel account to collect data. \nGenerally speaking, companies use Mixpanel to track what their users do on their site or apps, similar to an app developer or website owner watching over a user’s shoulder to learn what they click, view, or swipe. Mixpanel can also log information about the user’s devices, such as the size of the screen, whether they are on Wi-Fi or a cellular network, and the name of the carrier, among other data.\nScattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a coalition of primarily English-speaking hackers who are believed to be in Western countries. The hackers have a long history of data breaches and are responsible for some of the largest hacks this year, including data thefts targeting Salesforce and Gainsight customers, which affected hundreds of companies.\nAlso on Friday, SoundCloud confirmed that about 20% of its users were affected by “unauthorized activity in an ancillary service dashboard,” likely referring to Mixpanel. The audio streaming giant said the stolen data includes email addresses and “information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles.”\nSoundCloud did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nInstagram is expanding Reels-viewing beyond mobile, the social network announced on Tuesday. The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.\nBy bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don’t have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.\nIG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.\nReels will also play automatically, so you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch what’s next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nUsers have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. \nIt’s worth noting that IG for TV shouldn’t be confused with IGTV, which was Instagram’s app for watching long-form content before being shut down in 2022. \nThe launch of the TV app doesn’t come as a surprise, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in October that the company was planning a dedicated TV app. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re exploring TV,” Mosseri said at Bloomberg’s Screentime event. “TV is an increasingly important surface, it’s been very important for YouTube […] it’s been very important for TikTok. So we’d like to figure out how to make sure that we show up in a compelling way on all the relevant devices.”\nMosseri went on to note that it was a mistake for the company not to have explored a TV app earlier, and that he wishes they had done so a few years ago.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAdobe is updating its AI video-generation app, Firefly, with a new video editor that supports precise prompt-based edits, as well as adding new third-party models for image and video generation, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Astra. \nUntil now, Firefly only supported prompt-based generation, so you would have to recreate the entire clip if any part of the video was not to your liking. With the new editor, you can use text prompts to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, and we also get a new timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds and other characteristics easily. \nThe company first announced the new video editor in October in private beta, and now it is rolling out to all users.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nThe company said that using Runway’s Aleph model, users can give Firefly specific instructions, such as “Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject.”\nAnd with Adobe’s own Firefly Video model, users can now do stuff like upload a start frame and a reference video of a camera motion and tell it to recreate that camera angle for the video they’re working on.\nThe company also said users can now use the Topaz Labs’ Astra model to upscale videos to 1080p or 4K. Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 image generation model is coming to the app, too, along with a collaborative boards feature. \nThe company said FLUX.2 will be available on Firefly across platforms immediately, and Adobe Express users will be able to use FLUX.2 from January.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits: Adobe\nWith competitors releasing new models for image and video generation, Adobe wants to lure users into engaging with its app more. Along with new updates to the Firefly app, the company said subscribers of the Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit, and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model in the Firefly app until January 15.\nAdobe has made a ton of changes to its Firefly models and apps this year. In February, the company launched a subscription that let users access various levels of image and video generation; then it launched a new Firefly web app along with mobile apps later in the year, and has added support for more third-party models within the Firefly app.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past 12 months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”\nThe dictionary defines the term as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”\n“Like slime, sludge, and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology.\n“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”\nThe word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials — even entire movies. One study in May claimed that nearly 75% of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI.\nThese new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content can be milked for advertising money. Critics worry that this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which — as you might imagine — can be quite light on informational value. \nBut “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including cybersecurity reports, legal briefings, and the college essay, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least.\nRelatedly, tech words have been big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”   \n"

    "body": "\nMarley Alles started out in accounting.  \nShe thought that her dream was to work at a big company. “And then once I got there, I was like ‘oh, that’s it,” she told TechCrunch.  \nAlles began fostering other passions and found herself curious about the world of startups. She would listen to every podcast and read each book, taking notes on topics that interested her.  \nShe didn’t think much of it until one summer when so many of her friends got married, that she found herself spending thousands of dollars on bridesmaid dresses and bachelorette looks. One day, someone approached her and asked to borrow one of her dresses. “I was like ‘yeah, for sure, take it,’” she recalled. “And then I thought, ‘how can this be done on a larger scale?’” \nAlles had all these expensive dresses just sitting in her closet. She didn’t want to sell it, but she knew she probably would never wear those gowns again. “That’s what led me, long story short, to create Rax,” she said.  \nAlles launched Rax earlier this year as a peer-to-peer clothing rental company. It functions right now as a marketplace (it does not own any clothing inventory), where users scroll through listings and connect with people who have clothing items they want to rent.  \nShe’s bootstrapped the company so far, enough to fully code the app and officially launch it. The first few customers were her friends and family, and the rest came by word of mouth. Alles said she leaned into the idea of “building in public,” where she posted online about her adventures creating this product in hopes of amassing an engaged audience of potential customers. She has about 5,000 users on the app right now.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRex is one of the first of its kind to be launched in Toronto. It’s like Rent-the-Runway, or New York’s Pickle, or Europe’s ByRotation. The idea of renting clothes — similar to buying secondhand —has been picking up steam as it is seen as a more environmentally sustainable way to consume fashion rather than buying new items for each new season.  \n“It’s driving the circularity of fashion,” Alles said.  \nBut what makes Rex different from many others is that she offers long-term rentals. “On our platform, you can rent up to six months,” she said. “On competitor platforms, it’s daily rentals. So it gets really expensive if you want to rent for a couple week vacation. Or maybe you want a winter jacket for the season.”  \nAt TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Rex announced its first foray into the U.S. market. Alles said she had been a huge fan of TechCrunch and applied for the Battlefield competition, where she later won the top consumer pitch in the competition.  \nAlles said she was surprised to win. “There were so many companies that had like thousands or hundreds of thousands of users; raised [like] $20 million in my category, and one [had] the lead actors from [the show] Silicon Valley,” she said.  \nStill, she found the experience “awesome.” Alles went up to every startup booth to introduce herself to other founders, and also attended some sessions as well as partook in networking. Actually, that was one of the biggest lessons she’s said she’s learned as a founder — the importance of in-person interaction because it helps her connect with the community better.  \nNow that Disrupt has passed, Alles said the company hopes to continue its expansion across New York and start building out a rental service platform to offer fashion designers and retailers looking to offer rental clothing to consumers.  \n“We have the technology, we have the audience,” she said, adding that brands are also looking at ways to become more sustainable, and companies like Rex let them do it. “I think things are getting better and people are becoming more aware of their impact.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices. The appeal is obvious: if you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.\nCashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.\n“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”\nRather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.\nTo do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.\nAt its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: they’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.\nThe company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.\nThe startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement. \n“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.\nPlus, it should be cheaper, too. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAfter years in the wilderness, it’s a good time to be a nuclear startup.\n“For the first half a decade that I was telling people I was doing nuclear, I had to convince them, ‘Hey, here’s why nuclear is important,’” Bret Kugelmass, founder and CEO of Last Energy, told TechCrunch. “Now everyone just comes to us saying, ‘Oh yeah, of course nuclear is a key part of the solution.’ I’m like, okay, great, I’m glad everyone’s caught up now.”\nLast Energy is building small modular reactors — compact nuclear power plants that can be mass-manufactured to reduce costs. The company’s reactors are designed to produce 20 megawatts of electricity, enough to power roughly 15,000 homes.\nIt has momentum. Last Energy just closed a $100 million Series C led by the Astera Institute with participation from AE Ventures, Galaxy Fund, Gigafund, JAM Fund, The Haskell Company, Ultranative, Woori Technology, and others.\nThe company joins a slew of nuclear startups that have raised funding in recent months, buoyed by data centers’ insatiable power demands. Google-backed X-Energy raised $700 million last month, while Antares raised $96 million two weeks ago. And in August, Aalo Atomics raised $100 million to build its prototype reactor.\nWhat sets Last Energy apart from competitors is its approach: the company is using an old reactor design developed by the government decades ago. The initial design for the pressurized water reactor was built for the NS Savannah, the world’s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. That ship’s power plant was about one-tenth the size of Last Energy’s planned commercial reactor. Kugelmass said the company’s updated design should produce 20 megawatts of electricity.\nThe company is starting smaller, though. First, Last Energy is building a 5-megawatt pilot reactor at a site it’s leasing from Texas A&M. The new funding will fully fund the pilot project and help the company start delivering its first commercial products, Kugelmass said. Last Energy hopes to turn on the pilot reactor next year, with its 20-megawatt commercial-scale unit entering production in 2028.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast Energy’s startup’s reactor isn’t designed to be serviced during its lifetime. Instead, Last Energy is permanently encasing each core in 1,000 tons of steel. Kugelmass estimates the metal will cost around $1 million. “Most people think concrete is cheaper,” he said. “But not when it’s nuclear-grade concrete.”\nThe reactors will arrive on site fueled with six years’ worth of uranium. Apart from electrical and control connections, there are no other penetrations that break the steel wall. Heat from the fission reactions warms the steel, and water flowing through pipes on the outside harvests that heat to spin a steam turbine.\nWhen the reactor’s time is up, Last Energy will leave it on site, with the steel chamber serving as the waste cask, eliminating the need for separate disposal. \nThe hope is that this approach, coupled with manufacturing advances, will drive down the price of nuclear power. Kugelmass wouldn’t commit to a price, instead pointing to other industries that have halved prices for every tenfold increase in production. \n“I don’t think it’s going to be that good in nuclear because there are always some extra fixed costs that you have in nuclear regarding some of the special regulations, but that’s the type of trend you can see,” he said. “We don’t think in ones and twos, we think in tens of thousands.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDigantara, an Indian space surveillance startup, has raised $50 million in a new funding round as it moves beyond space situational awareness into missile tracking, citing growing demand from governments for space-based defence capabilities.\nThe all-equity Series B round included new investors such as 360 ONE Asset and SBI Investments of Japan, as well as serial entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, with existing backers Peak XV Partners and Kalaari Capital also participating. The funding comes more than two years after the startup’s $10 million Series A1 round, bringing its total capital raised to $64.5 million.\nGlobally, governments are investing more heavily in space-based surveillance and early-warning systems as missile launches and satellite interference become more frequent, with many seeking faster detection than traditional ground-based radar can provide. Digantara aims to tap that market by using its space- and ground-based infrared sensors along with software-based analytics and intelligence.\nFounded in 2020, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup initially focused on space situational awareness, tracking debris and objects that could damage satellites. The startup has since expanded its scope to include missile detection and tracking, building on the space- and ground-based sensing and analytics technologies it developed for space surveillance, its founder and chief executive Anirudh Sharma (pictured above) said in an interview.\nDigantara launched its first space surveillance satellite, SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking), in January aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-12 mission, enabling space-to-space observation. A month later, the startup opened an office in Colorado Springs as part of its push into the U.S. defence market, a move that has since led to contracts with U.S. Space Command for analytics-as-a-service. Its U.S. entity has also been selected for the Missile Defense Agency’s SHIELD contract vehicle, which supports next-generation missile defence programmes.\n“Given we’ve already built IR sensors, we are now extending our IR capabilities to other domains like mid- and long-wave infrared,” Sharma told TechCrunch.\nDigantara has split its operations across geographies to meet national security requirements. Its U.S. team is focused on building larger satellites and spacecraft in the 100-kilogram class tailored to American defence needs, while its India operation concentrates on analytics, data processing, and space situational awareness. The structure reflects the regulatory realities of defence procurement, where sensitive systems must be designed and built domestically for each market.\nDigantara has so far closed contracts with a combined value of about $25 million, Sharma told TechCrunch. The startup currently operates across India, Singapore, and the U.S., and plans to expand into Europe by setting up a local entity there as early as 2026.\nIn India, Digantara operates a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility capable of producing up to five satellites simultaneously, and plans to scale that capacity significantly. The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government of Andhra Pradesh to set up a larger facility that could manufacture as many as 30 satellites at once, which it aims to bring online next year.\nDigantara has already been selected as the winning bidder for government defence tenders in India and is completing administrative formalities before work begins, Sharma said.\nThrough 2026–27, Digantara plans to expand its space- and ground-based infrastructure, including additional electro-optical and LiDAR satellites for space surveillance, space-based sensors for early missile warning and tracking, and a larger network of ground-based observatories, the company said. It is also exploring the potential use of its LiDAR and laser technologies for future interceptor systems, Sharma asserted.\nDigantara plans to launch another satellite through SpaceX in March, followed by additional launches in June and October, with multiple satellites scheduled for the latter mission. The company aims to deploy a total of 15 satellites over the next two years, Sharma said.\nThe latest funding, he noted, will support those launches, with about $7–$10 million earmarked for expansion in the United States and roughly $2–$3 million set aside to establish operations in Europe, while the remainder will be used to scale its India-based manufacturing and operations.\nDigantara has seen revenues grow more than tenfold over the past two years, Sharma said, declining to disclose current figures. He added that the company is targeting annual revenues of $25–$30 million over the next 18 months as defence and government work ramps up.\nThe startup currently employs around 125 people, including roughly 80 to 85 engineers.\n"

    "body": "\nThe IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it?\nDatabricks is proving that point: the data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago. \nThis is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. \nThe company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1-billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products.\nSeries L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Datbricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts.\nIndeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. \n“The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers.\n“Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement.\nThe round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P.

    "body": "\nThe Nordic red-hot startup movement continues. On Tuesday, Neil Murray, founder and general partner at Copenhagen-based firm The Nordic Web Ventures, announced the close of a $6 million Fund III to continue investing in early-stage founders in the region.  \nThe fund will focus on writing the first institutional checks to companies focused on robotics, AI-native companies, and deep tech founders.  \nMurray, a solo GP, told TechCrunch that his first two funds were “test vehicles” to prove his ability to spot and invest in top talent in the region. Now, seven years later, he has written the first check into more than 50 companies, with a portfolio including the unicorn Lovable and the remote worker insurance company SafetyWing, and exits like the UI design company Uizard.  \nAs TechCrunch previously reported, the Nordic ecosystem (which includes Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) is now valued at more than half a trillion dollars and received more than $8 billion in venture funding in 2024, making the region one of the hottest emerging markets in Europe. Murray said Fund III had more than $20 million in investor interest, but he decided to cap it at $6 million because he cares “more about alignment than AUM.”  \nStaying small, he said, means he can better tie incentives to performance rather than management fees. He also said staying small, especially as a solo GP, gives him more flexibility while “everyone else is still debating.” \n“Capping the fund wasn’t a constraint,” he said. “It was the strategy.”  \nThe check sizes for the fund will be around $200,000, and he hopes to back between 30 and 35 companies. “I believe it is more important to be investing in Tier 1 founders than to back Tier 2 founders and over-optimizing for ownership,” he said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMurray’s limited partner base includes institutional backers such as Allocater One, founder Christoph Janz, and Pacenotes. Founders from Kahoot! And Pleo, in addition to operators from Meta and Google, is also LPs in Fund III. \n“Many founders from my first two funds have invested in my new fund, which is also an incredibly important metric to me,” he said, adding that he’s already returned more than half the capital he raised across Fund I and Fund II. \nHis Fund III focuses on AI, robotics, and consumer, he said, because those are some of the top sectors in the Nordic region. Consumer has always been a top category in the sector, as TechCrunch previously spoke about on a podcast about the region. \nThe region is also known for its computer science, engineering culture, and manufacturing, which, paired with a “calm methodical build style,” positions the Nordics well for “AI-powered robotics in industrial, healthcare, logistics, and increasingly consumer context.”  \nThough he has a keen interest in the Nordics, Murray actually hails from the UK and moved to Denmark in 2013 without knowing a single person, he recalled. \n“I was very interested in tech startups, having worked in digital products in London,” he continued. When he moved to Copenhagen, he realized the ecosystem has had a big contribution to the tech world, though people hardly spoke up about it. That led him to start the website “The Nordic Web,” where he broke down what was happening behind the curtains of the bugeoning tech scene there. \nThat website saw him tracking investments and exits and soon, VCs were asking him which founders were looking for capital. Soon, Murray wanted in on the action, and in 2017, launched a $500,000 Fund I. He stopped writing The Nordic Web shortly after to focus more on investing. And all of that has led him here. \n“Overall, the Nordics aren’t experiencing a ‘moment,’” he said. “They’re experiencing a compounding. The depth of talent, the ambition level, and the maturity of the ecosystem mean this wave isn’t a spike; it’s the foundation of the next decade of Nordic breakout companies.”  \n"

    "body": "\nEven three years after the generative AI boom started, most AI startups are still making money by selling to businesses, not individual consumers.\nAlthough consumers quickly adopted general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT, most specialized consumer GenAI applications have yet to resonate.\n“A lot of early AI applications around video, audio, and photo were super cool,” said Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, onstage at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event in early December. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.”\nChien compares some of those applications to the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.\nHe argued that, just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish.\n“I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period was the birth of massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb.\nWe could be seeing inklings of that stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT, Chien said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nElizabeth Weil, founder and partner at Scribble Ventures, echoed Chien’s sentiment about the early days of GenAI, describing the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground.”\nWhat will it take for consumer AI startups to grow up? Possibly a new device beyond the smartphone.\n“It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien said.\nWeil agreed that a smartphone may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products in large part because it is not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone as she showed it to the audience.\nStartups and incumbent tech companies have been racing to build a new personal device that can supplant smartphones.\nOpenAI and Apple’s former design chief, Jony Ive, are working on what’s rumored to be a “screenless,” pocket-sized device. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures. Meanwhile, a number of startups are trying, with often disappointing results, to introduce a pin, pendant, or ring that uses AI in a way different from how smartphones do.  \nHowever, not every AI consumer product will be dependent on a new device. Chien suggested that one such offering could be a personal AI financial adviser customized to the user’s specific needs. Similarly, Weil anticipates that a personalized, “always-on” tutor will become ubiquitous, with its specialized tutelage delivered directly from a smartphone.\nThough excited by AI’s potential, Weil and Chien expressed skepticism about the emergence of several, still-stealthy AI-powered social network startups. Chien said these companies are building networks where thousands of AI bots are interacting with the user’s content.\n“It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” he said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.”\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

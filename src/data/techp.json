    "body": "\nWhile tech stocks were busy setting records in 2025, the executives behind those companies were equally busy turning their paper fortunes into actual cash — more than $16 billion worth, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of insider trading data.\nJeff Bezos led the way. The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sanchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion.\nNvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business, and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion.\nMost of these sales happened through pre-arranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million.\nThe common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year.\n"

    "body": "\nOver the past few days, France and Malaysia have joined India in condemning Grok for creating sexualized deepfakes of women and minors.\nThe chatbot, built by Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI and featured on his social media platform X, posted an apology to its account earlier this week, writing, “I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt.”\nThe statement continued, “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on [child sexual abuse material]. It was a failure in safeguards, and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.”\nIt’s not clear who is actually apologizing or accepting responsibility in the statement above. Defector’s Albert Burneko noted that Grok is “not in any real sense anything like an ‘I’,” which in his view makes the apology “utterly without substance” as “Grok cannot be held accountable in any meaningful way for having turned Twitter into an on-demand CSAM factory.”\nFuturism found that in addition to generating nonconsensual pornographic images, Grok has also been used to generate images of women being assaulted and sexually abused.\n“Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk posted on Saturday.\nSome governments have taken notice, with India’s IT ministry issuing an order on Friday saying that X must take action to restrict Grok from generating content that is “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order said that X must respond within 72 hours or risk losing the “safe harbor” protections that shield it from legal liability for user-generated content.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFrench authorities also said they are taking action, with the Paris prosecutor’s office telling Politico that it will investigate the proliferation of sexually explicit deepfakes on X. The French digital affairs office said three government ministers have reported “manifestly illegal content” to the prosecutor’s office and to a government online surveillance platform “to obtain its immediate removal.”\nThe Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission also posted a statement saying that it has “taken note with serious concern of public complaints about the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) tools on the X platform, specifically the digital manipulation of images of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, and otherwise harmful content.”\nThe commission added that it is “presently investigating the online harms in X.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a custom chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.\nThe startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that the buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model.\nIn a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was whispering.\n“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call. \nLast year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble announced forthcoming rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with the app, it wants to provide the functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package.\nUsers can pre-order these buds using the startup’s site.

Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.\nTesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.  \nTesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.\nBut it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from the previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.\nTesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics.\nAnd yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAfrica’s largest fintech company, Flutterwave, has acquired Nigerian open banking startup Mono in an all-stock deal valued between $25 million and $40 million, according to people familiar with the transaction.\nThe acquisition brings together two of Africa’s leading fintech infrastructure companies. Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.\nMono has raised about $17.5 million from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received from Flutterwave. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.\nSources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received.\nFounded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.\nThe company addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.\nAccording to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.\nFlutterwave CEO Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”\nHassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving.\n“If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.”\nAgainst that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place.\n“This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said.\nThe transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale. \nBoth Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in Flutterwave’s Series C and Mono’s Series A) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years.\nThat collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years.\nWhen Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following Okra’s shutdown and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to raise significantly more capital.\nAddressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to Pitchbook, raised $15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment. \nStill, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.\n"

    "body": "\nGoogle believes AI can improve the TV-watching experience, which is why it brought its Gemini AI to Google TV devices in November. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings. \nThe company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead. \nDesigned for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. \nYou could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nImage Credits:Google\nGemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. \nBut Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. \nAt CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.\nImage Credits:Google\nGemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google.\nImage Credits:Google\nImage Credits:Google\nHowever, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice.\nNow, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option. \nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection. Not all languages, countries, or devices will be supported at launch, and users must also have a Google account to access the Gemini for TV experience. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s AI-powered overhaul of its digital assistant, now known as Alexa+, is coming to the web. On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.\nWhile Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.\nPlus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.\nRelated to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.) \nImage Credits:Screenshot of the new Alexa app\nOn the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.\nMore recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.\nThe Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Amazon\nIn addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place. \nThis is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.  \nThis ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.\n“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. \nHe continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”\nBut he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nAlexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year.  \nRausch tells us that over 10 million consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.\nHowever, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”\n“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.” \n"

    "body": "\nTwo months after coming out of stealth with a $150 million fundraise, Boston-based Teradar is showing off its first flagship terahertz sensor at Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week. The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”\nThe sensor will start shipping until 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects the Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles. \nTeradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively-unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.\nIt’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.\nTeradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, as the automakers backed away from the tech.\n\nThose deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.\nOther U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (acquired and merged with rival Velodyne after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTeradar is looking beyond automotive, too, and that vision was reflected in its recent raise. The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.\nLidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.\nTeradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity. \n“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nCalifornia is giving residents a new tool that should make it easier for them to limit data brokers’ ability to store and sell their personal information.\nWhile state residents have had the right to demand that a company stop collecting and selling their data since 2020, doing so required a laborious process of opting out with each individual company. The Delete Act, passed in 2023, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information.\nNow the Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request. Once DROP users verify that they are California residents, they can submit a deletion request that will go to all current and future data brokers registered with the state.\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean that all your data will be deleted immediately. Brokers are supposed to start processing requests in August 2026, then they have 90 days to actually process requests and report back. If they don’t delete your data, you’ll have the option to submit additional information that may help them locate your records.\nCompanies will also be able to keep first-party data that they’ve collected from users. It’s only brokers who seek to buy or sell that data — which can include your social security number, browsing history, email address, phone number, and more — who will be required to delete it.\nSome information, such as vehicle registration and voter records, is exempt from deletion because it comes from public documents. Other data, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA.\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe penalty for data brokers who fail to register or fail to delete requested consumer data is $200 per day, plus enforcement costs, according to the agency.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nSelf-driving trucks company Kodiak AI announced on Monday it is working with global automotive supplier Bosch to develop a system of hardware and software that can give standard big rigs autonomous driving capabilities. \nThe collaboration was announced at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it could help Kodiak bring its self-driving tech to more trucks, faster.\nKodiak, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, has already developed and designed a self-driving system with redundant systems for braking, steering, sensors, and computers. In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began making driverless deliveries for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. \nKodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.\nNow, the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses. \nBosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette. \n“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPaul Thomas, who is president of Bosch in North America and the company’s Bosch Mobility Americas division, appears to see this as opportunity for growth in the sector. \n“By supplying production-grade hardware, we are enabling the next generation of autonomous trucking alongside Kodiak,” said Thomas in a statement. “Kodiak has already deployed trucks with no humans on board in commercial operation and this cooperation gives us a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of real-world autonomous vehicle requirements and to further enhance our offerings for the broader autonomous mobility ecosystem.”\nWhile Kodiak’s plan is to scale and Bosch is keen to increase its market share in the sector, it’s unclear exactly when this will happen. Neither company provided a timeline for when these new systems might go into production or become available.  \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The new pin brings a physical button that lets you start and stop the recording. Plus, during the recording, you can tap the button to highlight a certain point — just like you can do on the newly launched Plaud Note Pro. \nOne nice thing about the $179 Plaud NotePin S is that you get a clip, a lanyard, a magnetic pin, and a wristband in the package. That means you can wear the device however you like. The company is also adding Apple Find My support for the pin, so that you can easily look for the device if you can’t find it.\nThe core specifications of the device remain the same from the previous generation. There is 64GB of onboard storage with a battery capacity of 20 hours of continuous recording. The device has two MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics that can capture clear audio within 9.8 feet of range. Users will get 300 minutes of transcription per month for free and\nAs compared to the Note Pro, this device has a shorter recording range and lower battery life. But it is smaller in size to carry using any of the above mentioned accesories. The company said that the pin is suited for people who are constantly on the go.\nImage Credits: Plaud\nThis is Plaud’s fourth device, and the company has sold more than 1.5 million devices until now. With these devices, the focus has been on in-person meetings. However, Plaud also wants to take on meeting notetakers like Granola, Fathom, and Fireflies with a new desktop client that works across meeting apps. The company said that the app can detect when a meeting is active and prompt you to capture the transcript.\nThe Mac app takes notes using system audio to capture the meeting, and then structures the transcription into notes using AI. The company introduced multimodal inputs for notetaking with its app that allows users to add images and typed notes along with audio transcription last year. Plaud is bringing that functionality to its desktop app as well. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

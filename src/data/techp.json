No one could have predicted that over 30 years later, Pixar would still be making Toy Story movies, nor could anyone have known that the latest installation in the franchise would pit Buzz Lightyear and a balding Woody against an evil AI tablet called Lilypad.\nBut sure enough, “Toy Story 5” confronts old-school toys like Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and Slinky Dog against the sinister threat of technology.\nThe trailer shows Bonnie, the young girl who inherited Andy’s toys when he left for college in “Toy Story 2,” playing outside with her toys when a surprise package with the Lilypad tablet arrives for her. She becomes completely enraptured by the tablet, not even looking up from the screen when her parents tell her that screen time is over.\nThe “Toy Story 5” trailer makes the Lilypad — or, Lily — out to be a sinister villain. When Jessie confronts the tablet about Bonnie’s well-being, Lily seems not to be paying attention, so the cowgirl demands that the tablet listen to her.\n\n\n\n“I’m always listening,” Lily says ominously, regurgitating Jessie’s impassioned speech in a computerized tone… and then translates it into Spanish.\n“Tech’s invaded our house,” Jessie tells Woody. “I’m losing Bonnie to this device.”\nWoody replies, “Toys are for play, but tech is for everything.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCould “Toy Story 5” pull at the heartstrings of young children and get them to think twice about the consequences of excessive screen time?

    "body": "\nA judge has denied Tesla’s request to overturn a $243 million jury verdict that held the automaker partially responsible for a fatal crash involving its Autopilot driver assistance system.\n“The grounds for relief that Tesla relies upon are virtually the same as those Tesla put forth previously during the course of trial and in their briefings on summary judgment — arguments that were already considered and rejected,” Hon. Judge Beth Bloom’s decision reads. “Furthermore, Tesla does not present additional arguments or controlling law that persuades this Court to alter its earlier decisions or the jury verdict.”\nLast August, a jury awarded a $243 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash in Florida that killed Naibel Benavides and critically injured Dillon Angulo. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. Notably, the jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla.\nTesla’s lawyers argued, in its request to reverse the ruling, that the blame rested on the driver, who helped cause the crash. \n"

    "body": "\nLucid Motors is laying off 12% of its workforce in a bid to “improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,” according to an internal memo that was obtained by TechCrunch. \nHourly workers on the manufacturing, logistics, and quality teams are not affected by the cuts, according to the memo, which was sent to employees being spared by the layoffs. It’s unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally at the end of 2024.\n“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today’s actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimately doubled its 2024 output last year.\nThe company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It’s collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.\n“Importantly, today’s actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”\nLucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company’s chief executive and chief technical officer, abruptly resigned on February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen a significant amount of turnover in its executive ranks, including the loss of its chief engineer, who sued the company in December for wrongful termination and discrimination.

    "body": "\nAbu Dhabi-based tech company G42 has partnered with U.S.-based chipmaker Cerebras to deploy 8 exaflops of computing power via a new supercomputer system in India, the companies said on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.\nThe system will be hosted in India and follow local data residency, security, and compliance rules. The project aims to provide computing resources for AI applications to educational institutions, government entities, and small and medium enterprises.\n“Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness. This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security,” Manu Jain, CEO of G42 India, said in a statement. \nAbu Dhabi’s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also part of the project. Last year, MBZUAI and G42 released Nanda 87B, a Hindi-English large language model built on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, which is purported to understand casual speech in Hindi and English.\n“Deploying this system in India marks a significant step forward in the country’s computational capacity and sovereign AI initiatives. It will accelerate training and inference for large-scale models, enabling researchers and developers to build AI tailored to India’s needs,” said Andy Hock, chief strategy officer at Cerebras.\nThe India AI Impact Summit this week saw several AI infrastructure initiatives being launched by both Indian giants and international firms.\nIndian conglomerate Adani pledged $100 billion to build up to 5 gigawatts of data center capacity in the country by 2035.

    "body": "\nFor the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.\n Ali Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO of venture firm Neo, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs — without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over 7% or sometimes 10% of their company before they’ve even started.\nPartovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introduced Neo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm’s now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.\nThe terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.\nFor the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.\n“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.\nIn comparison, Y Combinator typically takes a fixed 7% of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.\n The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.\nThe founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of Google Sheets and also Partovi’s uncle).\nBut the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.\n“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, said onstage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt.\nStartups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised $56 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.\nThe Neo Residency will also select five to eight students — either as individuals or small teams — who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.\nNeo is keeping the program small and elite: It will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.\nWhy is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.\nHis track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly $30 billion.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGeneral Catalyst, a Silicon Valley-based venture firm with more than $43 billion in assets under management, has announced it plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next five years, sharply expanding its push into the country’s startup ecosystem less than two years after merging with local venture firm Venture Highway.\nThe commitment, unveiled at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Friday, will target startups across artificial intelligence, healthcare, defense technology, fintech, and consumer technology. The announcement marks a significant increase from the $500 million to $1 billion the firm had previously earmarked for India.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country with more than a billion internet users, is positioning itself as a major AI investment destination. New Delhi aims to attract over $200 billion in AI infrastructure investments over the next two years as it hosts the India AI Impact Summit with participation from companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.\n“India will build the next generation of global platform companies,” General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja (pictured above) said, adding that the firm sees Indian founders as uniquely positioned to develop technology for markets serving enormous populations.\nGeneral Catalyst said it sees India’s biggest AI opportunity in large-scale real-world deployment rather than in building so-called frontier models. The firm cited the country’s government-built digital infrastructure, vast domestic market, and deep services talent pool as reasons for that view.\nThe push comes as India’s AI ambitions accelerate. At the summit, conglomerates Adani Group and Reliance Industries, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced plans to invest more than $200 billion combined to build AI data center infrastructure in the country. OpenAI has separately partnered with Tata Group’s TCS — one of India’s largest tech companies — to develop a 100-megawatt AI data center as part of the expansion of its Stargate infrastructure project. In recent months, global tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also outlined tens of billions of dollars in cloud and AI investments in the country.\nGeneral Catalyst has been building its India portfolio across fast delivery e-commerce, health tech, and deep tech, with investments including Zepto, PB Health, Raphe, Jeh Aerospace, Pronto, and Ayr Energy.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“This investment allows us to operate at a different scale in India,” Neeraj Arora, General Catalyst’s CEO for India, the Middle East, and North Africa, said, adding that the firm aims to support companies from early stage through to the public markets.\nGeneral Catalyst said it is developing a framework to accelerate large-scale AI adoption across priority sectors in India, aiming to help convert pilot projects into full deployments.

The company said on Friday that users between 18 and 24 years of age accounted for nearly 50% of messages sent to ChatGPT in the country, and users under 30 accounted for 80%. \nThe AI lab said Indians use ChatGPT mostly for work, with 35% of all messages relating to professional tasks, compared to 30% globally. \nIn particular, the company’s coding assistant, Codex, is seeing strong traction: OpenAI said Indians use Codex three times more than the global median, and weekly usage has increased by four times since the tool got a Mac app two weeks ago. Users in India are also asking three times as many coding-related questions as the median.\nThis is in line with findings from Anthropic, which earlier this week said 45.2% of Claude’s tasks map to software-related use cases in India.\nOpenAI said outside of work tasks, 35% of messages to ChatGPT from Indians requested guidance, 20% concerned questions about general information, and 20% were requests for the bot to produce or help with writing.\nIndia is OpenAI’s second-largest market with more than 100 million weekly users, and the company has been actively trying to court Indians for its AI tools and services. The company offers a sub-$5 subscription tier in the country, and last year even ran promotional campaigns to spur adoption.\n“AI adoption is moving faster than our ability to measure it – and that’s a challenge for anyone trying to make smart decisions.

    "body": "\nPeak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds. The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.\nThe capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.\nPeak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.\nThe firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.\nSingh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.\nHe added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.\nThe latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPeak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.\nAhead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.\nSingh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA U.S. federal court has sentenced a Ukrainian man to five years in prison for his part in a long-running identity theft operation that helped overseas North Korean workers gain fraudulent employment at dozens of U.S. companies.\nU.S. prosecutors brought charges in 2024 against Oleksandr Didenko, 29, a resident of Kyiv, for setting up North Koreans with stolen identities of U.S. citizens to get hired and earn a wage. Under this scheme, the workers’ earnings were funneled back to Pyongyang, which the regime used to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.\nThis is the latest in a string of recent convictions of individuals involved in facilitating ongoing North Korean so-called “IT worker” schemes. Security researchers have described North Korean workers as a “triple threat” to U.S. and Western businesses, as they violate U.S. sanctions, all the while enabling North Koreans to steal sensitive company data, and then later extort those victim companies into not publicly releasing corporate secrets.\nProsecutors said Didenko ran a website called Upworksell, which allowed people working overseas, including North Koreans, to buy or rent stolen identities for gaining employment with U.S. firms. Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities, per the Justice Department.\nThe FBI seized Upworksell in 2024 and diverted its traffic to its own servers. Polish authorities arrested Didenko, who was then extradited to the U.S. and later pleaded guilty.\nA screenshot showing Upworksell’s website at the time it was seized by the FBI (ImagE: TechCrunch/screenshot)\nIn a statement this week, the U.S. Department of Justice said Didenko also paid people to receive and host computers at their homes in California, Tennessee, and Virginia. These “laptop farms” are rooms containing racks of open laptops, allowing North Koreans to remotely perform their work as if they were physically in the United States.\nSecurity giant CrowdStrike said last year that it has seen a sharp rise in the number of North Korean workers infiltrating companies, often as remote developers or other technical software engineering jobs. The scheme is among many that the North Korean regime uses to enrich itself, while unable to use the global financial system, thanks to international sanctions.\nNorth Koreans are also known to impersonate recruiters and VCs in efforts to trick unsuspecting high-profile and high-net-worth victims into granting access to their computers, including crypto.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEven without a background in accounting, anyone who has ever glanced at a 10-K or 10-Q can tell that preparing financial statements is a complex, tedious process.\nWhile legacy platforms like Workiva and Donnelley Financial Solutions aim to streamline financial reporting, longtime accountants Mary Antony (pictured right) and Kelsey Gootnick (pictured center) found themselves exhausted by various manual hurdles within these tools (co-founder and CTO Jared Tibshraeny is pictured left).\nThe duo met seven years ago at Flexport, where Gootnick served as the company’s controller and Antony served as assistant controller. They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.\nNo matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.\n“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch.  \nSo, in 2023, the pair decided to launch InScope, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\nWhile InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOver the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the top 15 nationally.\nOf course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.\nNorwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.\nJacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.\n“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.\nAntony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:55 AM PST · February 20, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThreads already has over 400 million monthly users, but Meta wants to push that number even higher. With the launch of a new Threads feature this week, the company is making it easier for Threads users to share posts on the app to their Instagram Stories — a move that could capitalize on Instagram’s larger user base to bring more people to Meta’s X competitor.\nThe company announced on Thursday a new feature that lets you share a Threads post to your Instagram Story without having to leave the Threads app, instead previewing how the post would look on your Story directly within the Threads app.\nThe app previously allowed you to share anyone’s Threads post to your Instagram Story similar to how you would reshare someone’s Instagram post to your Story. It also already offered tools for sharing posts to your Instagram Feed or DMs.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta’s text-first, Twitter-like app Threads first launched in July 2023 and benefited from its ties with Instagram to rapidly grow its initial user base. To sign up, users had to authenticate with their Instagram credentials, which allowed Threads to populate with account details, like username, bio, and photo, as well as verification status and followers.\nWith one tap, users could immediately follow the accounts they already followed on Instagram — and those not on Threads would get a notification that someone had added them.\nIn the months and years following its launch, Meta has heavily leaned on its other, bigger social platforms to continue to grow Threads, including by displaying popular Threads posts on Facebook and adding a similar carousel of Threads posts to Instagram users. The company also made it easy for users to cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads, which also helped boost adoption. \nThese moves have paid off. Data from market intelligence provider Similarweb last month indicated that Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. (X still dominates on the web, however.) Threads’ numbers overall have been steadily growing as well, doubling usage from 200 million monthly active users in August 2024 to 400 million monthly users as of August 2025. The company announced in October that Threads reached 150 million daily active users, as well. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nMeta announced a major update for its immersive virtual world, Horizon Worlds, on Thursday that will see it leave the metaverse behind. The tech giant said it’s shifting focus for Horizon Worlds to be “almost exclusively mobile” and that it’s “explicitly separating” its Quest VR platform from the virtual world.\nMeta’s Reality Labs division for VR and smart glasses development has lost nearly $80 billion since 2020. The update to Horizon Worlds, and other recent moves, signals that Meta is significantly rethinking its VR ambitions.\nLast month, the company reportedly laid off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shut down several VR game studios. Additionally, it was reported that the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” \nHorizon Worlds originally launched in 2021 as a VR platform and later rolled out to the web and mobile. Meta said Thursday that to “truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”\nBy going mobile-first, Horizon Worlds is positioning itself to compete with popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.\n“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said in the blog post. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”\nRyan went on to note that Meta is still focused on VR hardware. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan wrote. \nMeta’s metaverse ambitions have effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. After shifting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is now focused on developing AI wearables and advancing its own AI models. \nDuring Meta’s latest earnings call last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”\nThe exec also stated that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, calling them “some of the fastest-growing consumer electronics in history.”\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDifferent AI labs have different priorities. OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.\nOn Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI, the AI startup recently acquired by SpaceX, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:\n\nIn one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.\n\nOf course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?\nTo answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”\nIn the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\nFirst, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and theorycraft, which is about what you would expect.\nThere are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!\nIt’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to Business Insider’s reporting) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.\n\nLoading the player…\n \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV subscribers unhappy about going more than a week without ESPN, ABC, and other Disney networks will be getting a $20 credit that can be applied to their next billing statement.\nVariety first reported on the credit, and a YouTube spokesperson confirmed the news to TechCrunch. The company says the credits are rolling out now, with subscribers receiving emailed instructions about how to apply it.\nDisney’s channels were pulled from the subscription TV service on October 31. YouTube says that if it reaches a deal, those channels will be restored within a matter of hours. As with similar disputes, this one appears to revolve around pricing, with YouTube criticizing Disney’s supposed price hike and Disney saying YouTube is “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\nThe subscription TV service’s last dispute with Disney was in 2022, leading YouTube TV to offer customers a $15 credit after Disney programming was removed for a day. \n"

Another potential upgrade, first reported by The Information, could improve 5G networks by allowing them to connect to satellites for increased coverage.\nThe basic features would be free, Gurman says, with customers paying carriers for more advanced support. In addition, Apple’s satellite partner Globalstar reportedly needs to improve its infrastructure to support these upgrades, which Apple is helping to finance.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

    "body": "\nVenmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo’s products. \nWhile cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo’s rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo’s Mastercard Debit Card.\nThe program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo’s service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains. \nHowever, this program also represents a new way that today’s brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.\nOne 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods. \nAs a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.\nIn Venmo’s case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes. \nIt also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo’s rivals, like Cash App’s offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit Card customers.  \nScreenshotImage Credits:Venmo\nInitially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month. \nHowever, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo’s program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald’s, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino’s, and Walgreens. \nThe PayPal-owned company says that, next year, the Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is adding new AI features, including a builder agent and an MCP server — a tool that connects AI assistants to Google Maps’ technical documentation — to help developers and users create interactive projects using Maps data and code. The company said it is using Gemini models across the board to power these features.\nAmong these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. For instance, you can type “create a Street View tour of a city,” “create a map visualizing real-time weatherin my region,” or “list pet-friendly hotels in the city.”\nOnce the code is generated, you can export it, test the preview project using your own API keys as needed, or modify the project in Firebase Studio.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe same tool also has a styling agent that lets users create a customized map to match a particular style format or theme. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding.\nGoogle already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources.\nWith this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. The feature can show a list, a map view, or a 3D display as an answer.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle is also adding a code assistant toolkit, the MCP server, which connects with Google Maps’ documentation. Developers can use this connection to get answers about how to use the Google Maps API and data.

    "body": "\nAutonomous vehicles are having a moment, and it’s making it a lot easier for smaller companies to raise money.  Vay, a German startup offering remote-controlled rental cars, will get $60 million in cash from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab, the company announced on Monday.\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year,” Vay CEO Thomas von der Ohe wrote on LinkedIn.\nThe Berlin-based startup uses its technology and human operators to remotely drive rental cars to and from customers. Vay isn’t yet commercially deployed in real traffic in Germany, where it lacked regulatory clarity until recently, but the company is currently operational in Las Vegas, where it in January 2024. Vay now plans to use Grab’s investments to scale and expand its operations in the U.S.\nVay will need to hit certain milestones in the US to unlock additional investment from Grab, including number of U.S. cities covered, regulatory approvals obtained, and overall consumer revenue.\nThe U.S. is seeing increased competition and fast-expanding offerings of various forms of remote driving. For instance, Alphabet-owned Waymo recently announced it would deploy its robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego. \nAlthough publicly traded on the Nasdaq, Grab does not operate in the U.S., where it will limit itself to supporting Vay’s growth. \nHowever, Vay describes driverless car rental as complementary to robotaxis. As for Grab, it sees Vay as serving “a growing segment of consumers who prefer not to be car owners,” Grab cofounder and CEO Anthony Tan said in a press release.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVay’s customers may not be car owners, but they still need a driving license: once the car gets delivered, the user takes over and drives it like a regular car. But unlike their own car, they don’t need to find where to park it. Vay says its service costs about half the price of ride-hailing, thanks to this hybrid approach and hardware-light system.\nAt the same time, the two companies plan to explore synergies between Vay’s and Grab’s business in Southeast Asia. Calling itself “the everyday everything app,” Grab’s ubiquitous super-app offers ​​all-in-one taxi, ride hailing, transport, express grocery shopping and food delivery options, as well as digital payments and financial services.\nWith a growing interest in mobility, Grab recently invested in autonomous driving tech startups including May Mobility out of the U.S. and WeRide out of China. The synergies it finds with Vay may well be on the tech side — for instance, it said that driving data collected by Vay could accelerate the training of AI models to improve autonomous driving.\nThis also aligns with Vay’s vision to become more than an electric rental car fleet. The company has already expanded into commercial and business-to-business services, and closed a partnership with self-driving truck company Kodiak Robotics. Ultimately, it aims to build a “global remote driving platform,” von der Ohe told TechCrunch earlier this year.\nAccording to Crunchbase, Vay had raised $131.8 million from backers including Kinnevik, Coatue, Eurazeo, Atomico, General Catalyst, Creandum, and the European Investment Bank. If fully unlocked, Grab’s investment would be a significant turbo. But with Nvidia announcing plans to invest $500 million into British self-driving tech startup Wayve, the race is only starting.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Blue Origin\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:17 PM PST · November 9, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin scrubbed the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket planned for Sunday afternoon due to concerns with weather, a few minor problems with launch pad equipment, and at least one cruise ship that strayed too close to the flight path. \nThe company said late Sunday that it will take another go at launching New Glenn’s second mission on Wednesday, November 12. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced restrictions on space launches late last week due to the government shutdown, and Blue Origin said in a post on X Sunday that it worked with the FAA to make the second attempt happen. The launch windo opens at 2:50 p.m. ET and lasts until 4:17 p.m. ET.\nThis mission is an important one for Blue Origin for a number of reasons. \nFor one, the company is still proving out the full reusability of the rocket. New Glenn successfully reached orbit during its first launch in January, but the booster exploded before it could land on a drone ship in the ocean. Blue Origin hopes to land the booster for the first time during this second flight.\nThis is also the first commercial mission for New Glenn. The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE spacecraft into space, where it will embark on a mission to Mars. New Glenn is also carrying a tech demonstrator for Viasat, which is part of another NASA project. Proving New Glenn can safely deliver payloads to space — and do it cost effectively thanks in large part to the rockets reusability — is crucial if Blue Origin wants to compete against Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\nBlue Origin originally planned to attempt the second launch earlier this year, but delayed it several times. Sunday’s launch window in Cape Canaveral, Florida initially opened at 2:45 p.m. ET, and the company had a window of roughly 90 minutes. The weather worries and the launch pad equipment issues caused that launch time to slip a few times.\nWith the clock running again just minutes before a launch attempt, a cruise ship entered the flight path, according to the broadcast. While that ship was expected to clear before the 4:15 p.m. ET close of the launch window, the weather was still a concern, and caused the company to scrub the attempt.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nA recent letter from OpenAI reveals more details about how the company is hoping the federal government can support the company’s ambitious plans for data center construction.\nThe letter — from OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane and addressed to the White House’s director of science and technology policy Michael Kratsios — argued that the government should consider expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) beyond semiconductor fabrication to cover electrical grid components, AI servers, and AI data centers.\nThe AMIC is a 35% tax credit that was included in the Biden administration’s Chips Act.\n“Broadening coverage of the AMIC will lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investment, and unlock private capital to help alleviate bottlenecks and accelerate the AI build in the US,” Lehane wrote.\nOpenAI’s letter also called for the government to accelerate the permitting and environmental review process for these projects, and to create a strategic reserve of raw materials — such as copper, alumimum, and processed rare earth minerals — needed to build AI infrastructure.\nThe company first published its letter on October 27, but it didn’t get much press attention until this week, when comments by OpenAI executives prompted broader discussion about what the company wants from the Trump administration.\nAt a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, CFO Sarah Friar said the government should “backstop” OpenAI’s infrastructure loans, though she later posted on LinkedIn that she misspoke:  “OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word ‘backstop’ and it muddied the point.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCEO Sam Altman also weighed in, writing that OpenAI does not “have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”\n“We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote, though he said the company had discussed loan guarantees “as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US.”\nIn the same post, Altman wrote that the company expects to end 2025 “above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030,” and he said OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in capital commitments for the next eight years.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nAfter Tesla shareholders approved a new compensation package that could be worth $1 trillion, CEO Elon Musk appears to be celebrating with a normal weekend on his social media platform X.\nIn an early Saturday morning post with the surely coincidental timestamp of 4:20am EST, Musk posted a video generated by Grok Imagine, the new photo and video tool from his company xAI. \nAs Musk described it, the video was generated by his prompt, “She smiles and says, ‘I will always love you.’” And the video does, in fact, show an animated woman on a rainy street, saying those words in an obviously synthetic voice.\n\nTwenty-four minutes later, Musk posted a Grok-generated video of the actress Sydney Sweeney saying, in a distinctly un-Sydney-Sweeney-like voice, “You are so cringe.”\nWhile it’s increasingly common to see people being weird about AI-generated women and even forming romantic relationships with chatbots, many X users pounced on the “always love you” video in particular, with one describing it as “the most divorced post of all time” and another calling it “the saddest post in the history of this website.”\nRemarkably, neither of those was the most stinging critique of Musk posted to X this weekend. Instead, the prize goes to 87-year-old, award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates.\nResponding to an impressively labyrinthine series of posts in which one user approvingly quoted Musk firing back at a Texas state senator who criticized his compensation package, Oates wrote that it’s “so curious” that Musk “never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates,” whether that’s posting about friends, relatives, nature, pets, movies, music, or books.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“In fact he seems totally uneducated, uncultured,” she wrote. “The poorest persons on Twitter may have access to more beauty & meaning in life than the ‘most wealthy person in the world.’”\nTo which Musk simply responded, “Oates is a liar and delights in being mean. Not a good human.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nNearly seven years after announcing its first fund, Sapphire Sport—the venture fund focused on sports, media, and entertainment—is spinning out from Sapphire Ventures. The fund will rebrand as an independent venture firm, 359 Capital.\nThe firm’s new name is a tribute to the sub-four-minute mile, a feat once deemed humanly impossible but ultimately achieved through rigorous dedication and perseverance. Spirito said that the name reflects the firm’s core principle of helping its portfolio founders achieve the impossible.\nThe separation from Sapphire Ventures, an investment firm with about $11 billion in assets under management, was always on “the vision board,” said Michael Spirito, managing partner and co-founder of 359 Capital. “We’re all grown up and ready to leave home.”\nSapphire Sport, which is currently halfway through investing its second fund of $181 million, has always maintained a separate group of limited partners from Sapphire Ventures. Its LPs are all deeply tied to the sports industry, including major names like City Football Group, adidas, AEG, Madison Square Garden, Sinclair, and dozens of team owners.\n“When we started in 2019, the name Sapphire Sport wasn’t just alliterative and sounded cool,” Spirito said. “Sport captured the LP group.”\nSeven years later, the sports-focused LPs still leverage their relationship with the firm to gain insights into emerging tech companies across the media and sports landscape, Spirito said.\nSome of the startups 359 Capital has backed include Beehiiv, a creator-focused newsletter; an online casino; Betty Labs, a sports media platform; Overtime, an AI search engine; Perplexity, a successful AI browser; and Tonal, a home gym system.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s entire portfolio of 30 companies and all of its investment staff will move over to 359 Capital. The transitioning staff includes Spirito, co-founders of Sapphire Ventures, David Hartwig and Doug Higgins, and newly promoted partner Rico Mallozzi.\nAs 359 Capital, the firm will continue to focus primarily on Series A and Series B startups, writing checks between $2 million to $10 million. The firm will continue to invest from its second fund through the first half of 2027, Spirito said.\n359 Capital will have high-profile competition in the world of sports-focused venture capital.  Courtside Ventures, backed by Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jordan, is in the process of raising a fourth fund of $100 million, according to an SEC filing.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Government surveillance vendors want us to believe their spyware products are only used in limited and targeted operations against terrorists and serious criminals. That claim is increasingly difficult to justify, given the broad range of victims — journalists, activists, and now political consultants — that have come forward.",
    "body": "\nFor more than a decade, makers of government spyware have defended themselves from criticism by saying that their surveillance technology is intended to be used only against serious criminals and terrorists, and only in limited cases.  \nThe evidence gathered from dozens, if not hundreds of documented instances of spyware abuse all over the world, however, shows that neither of those arguments are true.  \nJournalists, human rights activists, and politicians have repeatedly been targeted in both repressive regimes and democratic countries. The latest example is a political consultant who works for left-wing politicians in Italy, who came out as the most recently confirmed victim of Paragon spyware in the country. \nThis latest case shows that spyware is proliferating far beyond the scope of what we have typically considered to be “rare” or “limited” attacks targeting only a few people at a time. \n“I think that there is some misunderstanding at the heart of stories about who gets targeted by this kind of government spyware, which is that if you are targeted, you are Public Enemy Number One,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has studied spyware for years, told TechCrunch.  \n“In reality, because targeting is so easy, we have seen governments use surveillance malware to spy on a broad range of people, including relatively minor political opponents, activists, and journalists,” said Galperin. \nThere are several reasons that explain why spyware often ends up on the devices of people who, in theory, should not be targeted.  \nThe first explanation lies in the way that spyware systems work. Generally, when an intelligence or law enforcement agency purchases spyware from a surveillance vendor — like NSO Group, Paragon, and others — the government customer pays a one-time fee to acquire the technology, and then lower additional fees for future software updates and tech support.  \nThe upfront fee is usually based on the number of targets that the government agency can spy on at any moment in time. The more targets, the higher the price. Previously leaked documents from the now-defunct Hacking Team show that some of its police and government customers could target anywhere from a handful of people to an unlimited number of devices at once. \nWhile some democratic countries typically had fewer targets that they could surveil in one go, it wasn’t uncommon to see countries with questionable human rights records with an extremely high number of concurrent spyware targets.  \nGiving such a high number of concurrent targets to countries with such strong appetites for surveillance all but guaranteed that the governments would target far more people outside the scope of just criminals and terrorists. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about government spyware? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nMorocco, the United Arab Emirates (twice), and Saudi Arabia (several times), have all been caught targeting journalists and activists over the years. Security researcher Runa Sandvik, who works with activists and journalists who are at risk of being hacked, curates an ever-expanding list of cases of spyware abuse around the world.  \nAnother reason for the high number of abuses is that, especially in recent years, is that spyware — such as NSO’s Pegasus or Paragon’s Graphite — makes it extremely easy for government customers to successfully target whoever they want. In practice, those systems are essentially consoles where police or government officials type in a phone number, and the rest happens in the background.  \nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab who has investigated spyware companies and their abuses for a decade, said that government spyware carries a “huge abuse temptation” for government customers.  \nScott-Railton said spyware “needs to be treated like the threat to democracy and elections that it is.” \nThe general lack of transparency and accountability has also contributed to governments brazenly using this sophisticated surveillance technology without fear of consequences. \n“The fact that we have seen targeting of relatively small fish is particularly concerning because it reflects the relative impunity that the government feels in deploying this exceptionally invasive spyware against opponents,” Galperin told TechCrunch. \nIn terms of victims getting accountability, there is some good news.  \nParagon made a point of very publicly cutting ties with the Italian government earlier this year, arguing that the country’s authorities refused help from the company in investigating abuses allegedly involving its spyware.  \nNSO Group previously revealed in court that it disconnected 10 government customers in recent years for abusing its spyware technology, although it refused to say which countries. And it’s unclear if those include the Mexican or Saudi government, where there have been countless documented cases of abuse.  \nOn the customer side, countries like Greece and Poland have launched investigations into spyware abuses. The United States, during the Biden administration, targeted some spyware makers such as Cytrox, Intellexa and NSO Group by imposing sanctions on the companies —  and their executives — and putting them on economic blocklists. Also, a group of mostly Western countries led by the U.K and France are trying to use diplomacy to put the brakes on the spyware market.  \nIt remains to be seen if any of these efforts will curb or limit in any way what is now a global multi-billion dollar market, with companies more than happy to supply advanced spyware to governments with a seemingly endless appetite to spy on pretty much everyone they want to.  \n"

    "body": "\nAlthough LLM-powered AI agents are a fairly new phenomenon, one of the areas where they’ve been most popular so far is in sales. 1mind, a startup co-founded by Amanda Kahlow, has been quietly shipping its sales agent, named Mindy, for about a year.  \nOn Monday, the startup announced a $30 million Series A round led by Battery Ventures. This brings 1mind’s total raise to $40 million, the company says. \nKahlow is well known in the sales and marketing tech world as the founder and former CEO of 6sense. It was launched in 2013 as a lead-generation tool that tracked signals across social media and other sites to identify potential customers. She left in 2020.\nWhile the sales agent market is already crowded, 1mind, and its agent, named Mindy, aren’t doing what most of them do: sending emails and making cold calls. That’s a crowded market where even her previous firm, 6sense, offers agents.\n“I’m not playing in outbound,” Kahlow tells TechCrunch. Mindy is intended to handle inbound sales, going all the way to “closing the deal,” Kahlow says. This agent is used to augment self-service websites and, Kahlow says, to replace the sales engineer on calls for larger enterprise deals. It can also be the onboarding specialist, setting up new customers. \n“Our goal is to truly replicate the human experience across go-to-market when you have intent, when buyers are leaning in: they come to your website, or they’re in a zoom call. She can ride along and be the sales engineer,” Kahlow adds, referring to Mindy with the anthropomorphic pronoun. \nKahlow even goes so far as to call her AI agents “superhumans,” though they are neither human nor do they possess comic-book-style superhuman powers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEach agent can, however, be trained to understand an expansive knowledge base that encompasses all of a company’s products, technical details, competitive positions. \nWhile the startup uses a mix of underlying large-language models including OpenAI andG oogle Gemini, the agent limits hallucinations by using deterministic AI, both Kahlow and Mindy said (I invited the agent to our call). Deterministic AI provides guardrails so once the agent ingests corporate sales materials, it should recite that info without deviation. Beyond that, Mindy is trained to say she doesn’t know an answer\nWith a year of operations under its belt, 1mind is being used by more than 30 companies, including HubSpot, LinkedIn, and New Relic, to pitch and close deals. Kahlow says that her company’s entire roster of named customers all have annual contracts, not “experimental” budgets, and the “average contract is six figures.” \n1Mind AI agent MindyImage Credits:1Mind\nThe company also uses the bot internally on its own sales calls. But Kahlow has gone even father. She created an avatar of herself, Amanda, and took it with her to her VC pitches. \nDuring Battery Ventures’ due diligence, “we used it to go through the data room, asking lots of questions on things like case studies,” Battery partner Neeraj Agrawal told TechCrunch about the avatar Amanda. The data room refers to the stacks of data a startup will share about itself with a VC. \n“The conversation design is very nuanced, like what case studies it shares and when,” he said. The VC also determined that customers were having long back-and-forth conversations, indicating that they would forget they were talking to an AI.\nThat avatar is still accessible via Kahlow’s LinkedIn page, where the public can interact with it. It can answer questions about 1mind’s products, but also other areas, like Kahlow’s views of being a woman in tech. However, having chatted with it, it will — much like the human Kahlow — always attempt to bend the conversation toward 1mind. \nEventually, Kahlow says, 1mind and other agentic sales startups will even replace higher-end account executive sales roles. Or at least drastically reimagine them. \n“We’re not there yet where we’re fully replacing the AE. We’re replacing the website. We’re replacing the sales engineer, customer success, but that [AE/customer] relationship there is still happening,” she says.  “I think over time, a lot of what the AE is doing right now will go away.” \nShe believes this is currently mostly a trust issue. Agentic tech is so new that a buyer looking to sign an enormous enterprise deal isn’t ready to do it without a human. \nInterestingly, once trust develops, she thinks (and is already building for) agentic buyers. Agent-to-agent transactions won’t involve human avatars, but will instead be transfers of information and requirements.\nIn the meantime, 1mind still employs humans: 44 of them, including in sales, with 71 job openings, including for account execs.\nThe round included participation from Primary Ventures, Wing Venture Capital, Operator Collective, Harmonic Growth Partners and Success Venture Partners and angels from Monday.com, ZoomInfo, Databricks, Box, Gong, Braze, and Verkada, 1mind said. \n"

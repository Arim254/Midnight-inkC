This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.</p>\n<p>Put another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. </p>\n<p>Companies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.</p>\n</div>"

It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg 3845w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Prezent</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/accel-backs-indian-ai-startup-building-chatgpt-for-presentations/\">Presentations.ai</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/ex-microsoft-employees-get-4m-from-accel-to-build-an-ai-tool-for-product-presentations/\">Lica</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/gamma-brings-in-7m-to-bring-the-slide-deck-into-the-21st-century/\">Gamma</a>, and <a href=\"http://chroniclehq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chronicle</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Instagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn’t be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can’t believe something just because you saw a video of it.</p>\n<p>The Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QntoYdZNpTs\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg Screentime</a> conference this week. At the interview’s start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/mrbeast-says-ai-could-threaten-creators-livelihoods-calling-it-scary-times-for-the-industry/\">threaten creators’ livelihoods</a> and said it was “scary times” for the industry.</p>\n<p>Mosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won’t be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.</p>\n<p>“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they’re going to do is they’re going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\">financial</a>, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2025/09/23/environmental-cost-of-ai/85797763007/\" target=\"_blank\">environmental</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/the-human-costs-of-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\">human</a> costs of using AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/orgs-demand-action-to-mitigate-ais-environmental-harm/\" target=\"_blank\">which</a> are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/01/ai-training-data-has-a-price-tag-that-only-big-tech-can-afford/\" target=\"_blank\">substantial</a>.)</p>\n<p>In addition, the exec suggested that there’s already a lot of “hybrid” content on today’s big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what’s real and what’s AI generated will become even more blurred.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there’s gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.</p>\n<p>As things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn’t the “right focus” and was practically “a fool’s errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/#:~:text=Update%20on%20July%201%2C%202024%20at%207%3A00AM%20PT%3A%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\">labeling real content as AI</a>, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>While he didn’t elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta’s Community Notes feature, which is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/meta-is-launching-community-notes-in-the-us-next-week/\">crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year,</a> modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It’s likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn’t been labeled as such.</p>\n<p>Rather than saying it was fully the platform’s responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. </p>\n<p>“My kids are young. They’re nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they’re seeing a video of something doesn’t mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. </p>\n<p>“What they’re going to … need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)</p>\n<p>In the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/instagram-is-exploring-a-dedicated-tv-app-in-video-push\" target=\"_blank\">a dedicated TV app</a> and its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/instagram-is-testing-a-reels-first-ui-in-india-and-south-korea/\" target=\"_blank\">newer focus on Reels and DMs</a> as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok’s changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.</p>\n<p>On the latter, he said that, ultimately, it’s better to have competition, as TikTok’s U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it’s hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” </p>\n<p>“It’s the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you’re following — the same people. It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-confirms-google-has-strategic-market-status-in-search-services\" target=\"_blank\">designated</a> Google with a special status in the market for online search that would enable the regulator to enforce stricter regulations.</p>\n<p>The CMA has designated Google as having “strategic market status” in the search and search advertising markets, which means the company has such “a substantial and entrenched” position that it requires special regulations to ensure fair competition. </p>\n<p>“Google has had an unparalleled position in this digital activity for an extended period. Other traditional general search providers are significantly smaller than Google and have been for many years. Bing is the largest of these providers, but its current shares of queries and search advertising are both less than 5%. No traditional general search providers have materially grown relative to Google for at least fifteen years,” the CMA wrote in a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68e8b643cf65bd04bad76724/Final_decision_-_strategic_market_status_investigation_into_Google_s_general_search_services.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>.</p>\n<p>Although the designation does not mean that the CMA has found evidence of wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements, it does open the gates to launch further assessments and introduce interventions to change how Google runs its search services in the country, the CMA said. </p>\n<p>The designation covers Google’s search and online search advertising services; its AI-enabled search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode, and the “Discover” feed and results, as well as the “Top Stories” and News tab. It does not cover the Google News app and website, and search syndication services are also out of scope.</p>\n<p>The CMA, however, noted that while Google’s Gemini AI assistant isn’t covered by the designation at the moment, it will review the scope of the designation given uncertainty over how the AI search market is evolving. </p>\n<p>The regulator said it would launch a consultation on possible interventions later this year.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The move follows a nine-month <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uks-cma-slaps-google-search-and-its-90-market-share-with-an-antitrust-investigation/\">investigation</a> into the company launched earlier this year after the U.K.’s new digital markets competition regime came into force in January. The CMA was looking to prove if Google is enabling weak competition and “barriers to entry and innovation in search”; whether the company prefers its own services over those offered by third parties; and if it uses consumer data without their explicit consent. </p>\n<p>The CMA’s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6859810eeaa6f6419fade671/Roadmap_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> of possible enforcement actions may include: enabling U.K. residents to choose and switch search engines via choice screens; implementing data portability systems; enforcing fair ranking of search results; ensuring proper attribution of publishers’ work in search; and enabling consent mechanisms for Google’s AI services.</p>\n<p>Google, for its part, says that any interventions following the designation would harm innovation in the U.K. “The UK enjoys access to the latest products and services before other countries because it has so far avoided costly restrictions on popular services, such as Search. Retaining this position means avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions, which have cost businesses an estimated €114 billion,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/cma-designation-google-search/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation.

It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” </p>\n<p>(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance.

The deal never materialized. </p>\n<p>Calcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO’s co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie’s involvement with the spyware maker will end. </p>\n<p>Lavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-from-a-u-s-ban-to-u-s-ownership-nbsp\">From a U.S. ban to U.S. ownership </h2>\n<p>NSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning. </p>\n<p>Researchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, <a href=\"https://github.com/GranittHQ/data-pegasus-victims/blob/main/data-pegasus-victims.csv\" target=\"_blank\">have for years documented dozens of cases</a> where NSO’s government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others.  </p>\n<p>NSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/27/spyware-diplomats-us-pegasus/\" target=\"_blank\">was caught in 2021</a> targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad. </p>\n<p>Soon after, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. Commerce Department banned</a> American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/20/nso-group-pegasus-trump-eo/\" target=\"_blank\">tried to get off the U.S. government’s blocklist,</a> as recently as May 2025, with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/\" target=\"_blank\">the help of a lobbying firm</a> tied to the Trump administration.  </p>\n<p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO’s spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition. </p>\n<p>“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds.  </p>\n<p>“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities. This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.” </p>\n<p>NSO’s ownership has exchanged hands before.  </p>\n<p>Originally founded by Niv Karmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, NSO Group was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/12/01/this-spy-tool-can-find-you-with-just-a-telephone-number-and-25-countries-own-it-warn-researchers/?sh=7d4b92b6331e\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The energy transition is seemingly under assault, with congressional Republicans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/final-gop-bill-kneecaps-renewables-and-hydrogen-but-lifts-nuclear-and-geothermal/\">killing tax credits</a> for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/trumps-doe-proposes-cutting-billions-in-grants-for-gm-ford-and-lots-of-startups/\">cancel billions of dollars’ worth of grants</a>. </p>\n<p>But there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.</p>\n<p>Investor sentiment, judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: People and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.</p>\n<p>This week, Brookfield, the Canadian infrastructure and asset management giant, announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. Brookfield has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculate that clean energy was <a href=\"https://www.energyconnects.com/news/renewables/2021/november/green-investing-may-be-a-bubble-jeremy-grantham-says-but-he-s-doubling-down/\" target=\"_blank\">entering a bubble</a>. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.</p>\n<p>Also this week, Energy Impact Partners (EIP) announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early-stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>Climate tech — or whatever people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/21/if-climate-tech-is-dead-what-comes-next/\">are calling it these days</a> — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/climate-investors-canada-wildfires/\">too hard to ignore</a> for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early-stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Already, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\">Quilt</a>, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Investing trends that have developed over the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/large-funds-are-too-invested-in-the-energy-transition-to-turn-back-now/\">nearly $1 trillion</a> to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/research-center/report/60abbe3b-aa8d-3f41-98e3-e9093b0f2d3a\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">openly opposed</a> to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2025\">revised downward</a> the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.</p>\n<p>Despite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expected to double by 2030, led by solar installations in China, India, the EU, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/zeno-emerges-from-stealth-to-crib-teslas-master-plan-for-africa-and-beyond/\">Subsaharan Africa</a>.</p>\n<p>The IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV <a href=\"https://www.dnv.com/eto2025/\" target=\"_blank\">expect</a> that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. </p>\n<p>It won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

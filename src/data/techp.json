Deel on Thursday announced that it has raised a $300 million Series E round co-led by A-list fintech VC firm Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from existing investors like Coatue Management and General Catalyst.\nDeel says it’s been profitable for three years and surpassed $1 billion in ARR, including having a month — September — that hit $100 million in revenue. Deel’s business model focuses on serving global companies, handling the complexities of currency and employment regulation for far-flung international teams. It says it’s now grown to 35,000+ customers with more than 1.5 million workers in over 150 countries.\nThose are the types of numbers that attract investment, pending lawsuits or no. (Rippling’s California-filed lawsuit against Deel does not yet have a trial date and is in the discovery phase, according to court records.) Indeed, Ribbit’s founder, Micky Malka, and a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz, gave Deel their full-throated supported in the announcement. In prepared statements, Malka said that Ribbit has been a “fan” of the HR company for a long time, because it’s a “a brand companies trust,” and Horowitz said that a16z has been “blown away” by Deel’s work to build “the best HR platform” for global companies.\nFor what it’s worth, the lawsuits have not slowed down Rippling’s fundraising efforts either. In May, Rippling raised a $450 million Series G round at a $16.8 billion valuation.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

The scope of the change is “quite wide” and includes components and assembly for the company’s future notebooks and server products, Nikkei cited a supply chain source as saying. \nThe company is reportedly asking its existing partners to prepare manufacturing capabilities outside the country starting next year, and it is also pushing to move some production of its Xbox gaming consoles to other parts of Asia.\nAmazon Web Services, meanwhile, is considering buying fewer printed circuit boards for its AI data centers from its long-time supplier SYE, and has conducted an evaluation of what it could need to do. And Google is pushing its suppliers to ramp up server production in Thailand, where it has already secured multiple partners for parts, components, and assembly, the report said.\nHowever, moving production outside the country so quickly would prove difficult, given the vast range of components involved and their Chinese partners’ technological and manufacturing prowess, Nikkei noted.\nThe news follows a wave of retaliatory measures from both China and the U.S., who have taken turns to impose increasing tariffs on each other, tighten export controls on crucial components and resources, and restrict what tech can be sold.\nMicrosoft, Google, and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n"

The U.S. government is, according to these allegations, looking for posts that express views that the current government disfavors.\nThe lawsuit states that the list of forbidden posts include those that criticize the American culture and the U.S. government; that express antisemitic/pro-Palestine support including support of university protests on the matter; those that rationalize or make light of Charlie Kirk’s murder; or criticize the Trump administration or its actions.\nThe EFF also alleges that the government is threatening non-citizens with punishments, which includes revoking their visas to immigration confinement.\nThe lawsuit points to posts on the State Department’s X account. This includes the currently pinned thread documenting the visas that the department revoked over comments about Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S.:— Department of State (@StateDept) October 14, 2025\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the auto union, teachers union, and communication workers union.\nThe EFF’s suit claims that these punitive actions, as well as the “viewpoint based” surveillance itself, is an unlawful violation of freedom of speech of these union’s members. \nThe full lawsuit can be found here.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t"

Once the 60 days are over, you’ll be blocked from using the Mac Messenger app. We encourage you to delete the app since it will no longer be usable.”\nMeta’s plan to wind down these desktop apps was first spotted by Appleinsider. \nThe company is now alerting users of the upcoming change to give them time to familiarize themselves with other options. For example, Windows users can use the Facebook desktop app, and both Windows and Mac users can access Messenger online.\nMeta is encouraging users to activate secure storage and to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web version. Once users transition to Facebook.com, their chat history will be available on all platforms. Users can check if they have secure storage turned on by clicking the settings icon above their profile picture and then selecting “Privacy & safety, and then clicking “End-to-end encrypted chats.” From there, they need to click “Message storage” to check if “Turn on secure storage” is turned on.\nThe move comes a year after Meta replaced the native Messenger app with a Progressive Web App back in September 2024. Of course, Meta’s decision to discontinue the desktop apps altogether will likely see some backlash from avid users of the apps. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe sprawling metropolis of Phoenix continues to be a testbed for Waymo, and not just on the technical front. The Alphabet-owned company has used its first testing and commercial market to experiment with its business model, too, including delivery.\nWaymo is known for its robotaxis, but it has tested how its tech could be used for delivery. The company previously tapped UPS and Uber Eats for pilot programs, and it also put considerable staff and resources towards developing self-driving trucks under its Waymo Via arm, before shuttering that program in 2023 to focus on robotaxis.\nNow, it seems Waymo is ready to test the delivery waters through a strategic, multi-year partnership with DoorDash. Waymo doesn’t have any other active delivery-focused testing, operations, or partnerships, according to a company spokesperson. \nThe partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, the company wrote in a blog post.\nNot every DoorDash order will result in a Waymo delivery. Initially, the Waymo delivery service will deliver orders from DashMart — DoorDash’s convenience, grocery, and retail stores. The companies said that, over time, more local Phoenix merchants and a wider variety of offerings will be added.\nDavid Richter, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at DoorDash, said the deal with Waymo will give customers a “new and delightful experience, while advancing our vision for a multi-modal autonomousfuture of local commerce.”\nDoorDash isn’t new to the autonomous vehicle technology arena. The company has partnered with sidewalk delivery bot company Serve Robotics to cover parts of Los Angeles. It also has its own in-house autonomous vehicle tech team that developed and produced an autonomous delivery bot called Dot. The delivery bot, which was revealed in September, is being tested in the Phoenix area.\nThe deal with Waymo won’t involve DoorDash’s Dot vehicle, however. Instead, food or groceries will be placed in the trunk of a Waymo vehicle — a driverless Jaguar I-Pace that will navigate on its own to the customer. From here, the customer will have to retrieve the items from the trunk via the DoorDash app. \nThis last step, which requires the customer to walk out to the car and grab the delivered items, will be the big test for both companies, hoping to determine if receiving groceries delivered by an autonomous vehicle outweighs the convenience of a human handing over the items at their door. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade. She is currently the transportation editor at TechCrunch and co-host of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.

    "body": "\nAmazon One Medical, the retailer’s primary care provider acquired in 2022, is launching a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for children ages 2 to 11, the company announced on Thursday. Message-based visits start at $29, and video visits cost $49.\nThe healthcare service doesn’t require insurance or a One Medical membership and can help treat issues like pink eye, lice, and more than 10 skin-related issues, including eczema, bug bites, contact dermatitis, fungal rashes, and more. The service also covers EpiPen and asthma medication renewals.\nAmazon started offering a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for adults in 2024.\n“This service isn’t meant to replace a family’s relationship with their child’s pediatrician, but rather to serve as a convenient option for those ‘in-between’ moments for parents with time-sensitive concerns who don’t already have on-demand access through a One Medical membership,” said Natasha Bhuyan, MD, family physician and national medical director for Amazon One Medical, in a press release. \nThe move comes as companies like Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart are scaling back their retail health services. \nAmazon last week debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics, starting in Los Angeles. The kiosks have a range of commonly prescribed medications, including antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure medications.\nThese new kiosks could disrupt brick-and-mortar pharmacy businesses, which are already struggling. For instance, Rite Aid recently closed all of its remaining stores; CVS has closed more than 1,000 stores since 2021; and Walgreens closed 500 stores over the past year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe launch of the new pay-per-visit service for kids marks Amazon’s latest move to expand its presence in the healthcare sector.

    "body": "\nBetween infinitely scrolling job boards and the puzzling rise of fake applicants using AI to apply en masse, job-searching has quickly become one of the most bewildering experiences the internet has to offer. Listings are posted and reposted across different platforms as applications go unanswered, creating a spam-like flood of activity on both sides.\n“If you put a job on LinkedIn, you might get 1,000 people applying for that job within the first six hours,” says Matt Wilson, a London-based serial entrepreneur. “Some companies don’t even review the applicants that apply for those jobs, because the signal to noise ratio is very, very low.”\nWilson’s new solution is Jack & Jill, a new platform that uses conversational AI to reinvent the recruitment process from the ground up. The company announced $20 million in seed funding today, led by EU investor Creandum, but it’s hardly been in stealth. Service is already live in London, where the outfit has garnered nearly 50,000 users — and Wilson wants to use the influx of cash to fuel a U.S. expansion and take Jack & Jill to a new level.\n“There hasn’t been a major change in how people find jobs since LinkedIn and Indeed came on the scene 20 years ago,” says Wilson. His bet is that, with AI chatbots changing workplaces across the world, now might be the time to shake things up.\nAs you might guess from the name, Jack & Jill is a two-part platform. The “Jack” side of the platform handles the applicant side, giving users a 20-minute, AI-powered profile interview before providing them with a select list of roles pulled from online databases. From there, Jack can be used for mock interviews or more involved professional coaching. “Jill” works with employers, building a profile of a particular role and elevating candidates that match its requirements. Like LinkedIn, part of the goal is for both workers and hiring managers to keep an active presence on their respective apps, letting the app pull players off the sidelines as needed. The service takes a standard commission from any successful hire, and as the scope of the platform grows, Wilson hopes to make Jack & Jill indispensable for both sides.\nThat might sound like a standard recruiting system with a little AI sprinkled on top, but Wilson thinks conversational chatbots are more important than a simple matching algorithm. By building the process around chatbot interviews, he believes he’s found a scalable alternative to the endless shuffle of listings and résumés, potentially reinventing the basic elements of the contemporary hiring process.\nUsing AI systems to conduct first-round interviews is increasingly common in many parts of the world — particularly in China, where many multinational corporations have used the practice for hiring local roles. But while a surprise interview with an AI hiring manager might seem alienating, Wilson hopes that Jack & Jill’s approach will result in more intelligence applied to job placement overall.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I think the way that we are mapped to the companies we work for, and vice versa, is just extremely inefficient,” Wilson says. “There are billions of people out there that could be in better jobs for them. And that’s a mission worth working on.”\nAn earlier version of this piece was published with an erroneous figure in the headline.

    "body": "\nTravel search engine Kayak will now allow users to research trips ahead of booking using AI. The company this week launched an “AI Mode” feature that lets users ask travel-related questions as well as compare and book flights, hotels, and cars, through an AI chatbot integrated on the company’s website.\nThe feature is currently available across both desktop and mobile web, and takes advantage of Kayak’s integration with ChatGPT to deliver contextual results. \nThe rollout follows the company’s April launch of Kayak.ai, built as a testing ground for working with AI technology. That site also combined Kayak’s data and tools with OpenAI’s technology, letting its tech team try out AI features ahead of bringing them over to Kayak.com\nEssentially, the AI Mode feature offers the same functionality as the Kayak.ai website, but is now built directly into Kayak’s website. The company suggests users could ask the chatbot for travel ideas, like locations to fly to for under a certain price point, the best deals to a preferred destination, comparing hotel amenities, finding nonstop flights, rental car options, and more. \nImage Credits:Kayak\nPlus, users can ask the AI more open-ended questions, like “I want to party for NYE — where should I go?” to get recommendations without having specific destinations in mind. Or they could learn when the best time to fly somewhere would be, based on ticket prices. (Kayak has shared other AI prompt ideas on its own blog). \nThe feature could be useful in helping consumers in the earlier stages of travel planning, when they’re just exploring ideas. However, it remains to be seen if AI users readily convert to paying customers using these methods. \nAI Mode is initially available in English in the United States, but will expand to other countries and languages later in the month. The company also plans to roll out the feature to more platforms and add support for voice-based requests “soon.”\nImage Credits:Kayak\nTravel is an area that’s being explored by AI providers and travel companies alike, as online booking can be a frustrating and tedious experience for consumers as it stands today. To test consumer demand for AI solutions, OpenAI recently announced deals with travel companies like Expedia and Booking.com. (The latter is also owned by Kayak’s parent company, Booking Holdings). As a result, those services can now operate as apps inside ChatGPT.\nBy comparison, Kayak’s decision to run the AI chatbot on its own site could provide the company with more direct access to consumer insights about the AI’s use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\"Loneliness is the biggest disease in the world right now,\" founder Francesco Vitali said. \"So we built a platform where human time has value again, and a place where being human is important.\"",
    "body": "\nFrancesco Vitali will be the first to admit that when his co-founder Chris Siametis first pitched him on Rent a Cyber Friend, he didn’t quite get the idea.\n“Who’s going to pay somebody to speak with somebody?” Vitali told TechCrunch. “But Chris was insistent. Chris is a millennial, and I’m Gen X, so it wasn’t easy for me to understand his vision.”\nVitali had worked with Siametis for about two decades together; they ran 48FILM, an international short film festival (Vitali is also a film producer). So, he took a leap of faith to trust his collaborator on the idea he couldn’t shake: a video chat platform where people can pay per minute for a casual conversation with a “cyber friend.”\nRent a Cyber Friend ballooned to 3 million registered users without raising venture capital or spending any money on marketing. The company doesn’t even have social media because it’s too short-staffed to devote resources to it. The startup is part of Startup Battlefield, and will be presenting at TechCrunch Disrupt at the end of this month in San Francisco.\nThe company’s fast growth proved Vitali’s first reactions wrong, but as he used the product himself, he began to realize that there’s a big market for human connection — especially in a time when people are paying to talk to AI bots.\n“Loneliness is the biggest disease in the world right now,” Vitali said. “Millions are lonely, and they are underemployed or seeking purpose. So, we built a platform where human time has value again, and a place where being human is important.”\nCyber friends are first vetted to verify their identity, and then they can set a per-minute rate to charge for their conversations; the platform keeps 20% of that fee. People aren’t just paying for companionship. Some cyber friends charge a higher rate if they’re an academic or vetted expert in a specific subject area, or if they speak a particular language that a user would like to practice.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor any social media platform — especially one that connects people in real-time video chats — safety and content moderation is a challenge. Vitali notes that the platform has a block feature, but as the company continues to grow, it will need to invest further in maintaining a healthy environment. He said that next on the product road map is a more robust and efficient system for vetting potential cyber friends more quickly and thoroughly.\nVitali’s turning point came not long after the company launched when he connected with a 19-year-old from China. He noticed that this person was one of the site’s most active users, and he spent $200 per day to talk to people. Vitali rigged the site so that he would be the only cyber friend available and used the opportunity to ask the user about his experience without revealing that he founded the company.\n“He said, ‘I don’t feel safe to go out at the mall and meet with strangers, but this site gives me the possibility to exchange culture and meet people from all over the world,’ and that was the first moment that I realized we have something here,” Vitali recalled. \nHe still thinks that the connections that people make in person are irreplaceable. But on an internet where people are sucked into addictive or dangerous connections with AI chatbots that are designed to maximize engagement, this step of turning toward humanity means something to him.\nIf you want to learn more about Rent a Cyber Friend from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nFor one week this summer, Taylor and her roommate wore GoPro cameras strapped to their foreheads as they painted, sculpted, and did household chores. They were training an AI vision model, carefully syncing their footage so the system could get multiple angles on the same behavior. It was difficult work in many ways, but they were well paid for it — and it allowed Taylor to spend most of her day making art. \n“We woke up, did our regular routine, and then strapped the cameras on our head and synced the times together,” she told me. “Then we would make our breakfast and clean the dishes. Then we’d go our separate ways and work on art.” \nThey were hired to produce five hours of synced footage each day, but Taylor quickly learned she needed to allot seven hours a day for the work, to leave enough time for breaks and physical recovery. \n“It would give you headaches,” she said. “You take it off and there’s just a red square on your forehead.” \nTaylor, who asked not to give her last name, was working as a data freelancer for Turing Labs, an AI company which connected her to TechCrunch. Turing’s goal wasn’t to teach the AI how to make oil paintings, but to gain more abstract skills around sequential problem-solving and visual reasoning. Unlike a large language model, Turing’s vision model would be trained entirely on video — and most of it would be collected directly by Turing. \nAlongside artists like Taylor, Turing is contracting with chefs, construction workers, and electricians — anyone who works with their hands. Turing Chief AGI Officer Sudarshan Sivaraman told TechCrunch the manual collection is the only way to get a varied enough dataset. \n“We are doing it for so many different kinds of blue-collar work, so that we have a diversity of data in the pre-training phase,” Sivaraman told TechCrunch. “After we capture all this information, the models will be able to understand how a certain task is performed.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTuring’s work on vision models is part of a growing shift in how AI companies deal with data. Where training sets were once scraped freely from the web or collected from low-paid annotators, companies are now paying top dollar for carefully curated data.  \nWith the raw power of AI already established, companies are looking to proprietary training data as a competitive advantage. And instead of farming out the task to contractors, they’re often taking on the work themselves. \nThe email company Fyxer, which uses AI models to sort emails and draft replies, is one example.  \nAfter some early experiments, founder Richard Hollingsworth discovered the best approach was to use an array of small models with tightly focused training data. Unlike Turing, Fyxer is building off someone else’s foundation model — but the underlying insight is the same.  \n“We realized that the quality of the data, not the quantity, is the thing that really defines the performance,” Hollingsworth told me. \nIn practical terms, that meant some unconventional personnel choices. In the early days, Fyxer engineers and managers were sometimes outnumbered four-to-one by the executive assistants needed to train the model, Hollingsworth says. \n“We used a lot of experienced executive assistants, because we needed to train on the fundamentals of whether an email should be responded to,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a very people-oriented problem. Finding great people is very hard.” \nThe pace of data collection never slowed down, but over time Hollingsworth became more precious about the data sets, preferring smaller sets of more tightly curated datasets when it came time for post-training. As he puts it, “the quality of the data, not the quantity, is the thing that really defines the performance.” \nThat’s particularly true when synthetic data is used, magnifying both the scope of possible training scenarios and the impact of any flaws in the original dataset. On the vision side, Turing estimates that 75 to 80 percent of its data is synthetic, extrapolated from the original GoPro videos. But that makes it even more important to keep the original dataset as high-quality as possible. \n“If the pre-training data itself is not of good quality, then whatever you do with synthetic data is also not going to be of good quality,” Sivaraman says. \nBeyond concerns of quality, there’s a powerful competitive logic behind keeping data collection in-house. For Fyxer, the hard work of data collection is one of the best moats the company has against competition. As Hollingsworth sees it, anyone can build an open-source model into their product – but not everyone can find expert annotators to train it into a workable product. \n“We believe that the best way to do it is through data,” he told TechCrunch, “through building custom models, through high quality, human led data training.” \n"

    "body": "\nEnergy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems said Thursday it’s working with Google’s DeepMind division to fine tune — and even improve — the operation of its forthcoming Sparc reactor using AI.\nThe companies plan will simulate the plasma that will burn inside CFS’s reactor using specialized DeepMind software known as Torax. They also plan on pairing Torax with AI models to help CFS figure out how best to achieve fusion power.\nFusion power promises to deliver massive amounts of electricity with zero emissions from a near limitless source of fuel: water. AI-related companies have been bullish on fusion startups as a source of electricity to power energy-hungry data centers. Google appears to be eyeing them as potential customer as well.\nThis isn’t Google’s first foray into nuclear fusion. The tech company has worked with another fusion startup, TAE Technologies, to use AI to study how plasma behaves inside TAE’s fusion machine. \nThere’s a reason Google keeps coming back to the problem: AI might be uniquely suited to making fusion power possible. \nOne of the biggest challenges facing fusion startups is keeping the plasma inside a reactor hot enough for long enough. Unlike nuclear fission reactions, which are self-sustaining, fusion reactions are difficult to maintain outside of stars like the Sun. Without that sort of mass and gravity, the plasma is constantly in danger of diffusing and snuffing itself out. \nIn CFS’s reactors, powerful magnets substitute for gravity to help corral the plasma, but they’re not perfect. Reactor operators have to develop control software that can enable the device to continuously react to changing plasma conditions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nProblem is, there are almost too many knobs to turn, certainly more than a human is capable of. That’s the sort of problem that AI excels at. Experts have cited AI as one of the key technologies that has enabled the industry’s remarkable advances over the past several years.\nCFS is currently building Sparc, its demonstration reactor, in a suburb outside Boston. The device is about two-thirds completed, and when finished later in 2026, the startup is predicting that it will be the first fusion device capable of producing more power than the plant needs to run itself.\nGoogle said Torax can be used with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search models to find the “most efficient and robust paths to generating net energy.” The two companies are also exploring whether AI can be used to control the reactor’s operation. \nIn August, Google participated in CFS’s $863 million Series B2 round alongside Nvidia. Earlier this year, Google also said it would buy 200 megawatts of electricity from CFS’s first commercial power plant, Arc, which is planned to be built outside Richmond, Virginia. The tech company is also an investor in CFS competitor TAE Technologies. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "Spotify has announced new partnerships with major record labels — including Sony, Universal, Warner, and Merlin — to build “responsible AI” tools that protect artists’ rights and ensure fair compensation. The initiative will let artists opt in or out of AI use.",
    "body": "\nSpotify on Thursday announced a series of deals with major record labels to develop new AI products designed to ensure fair compensation and center artists and songwriters in the experience. In partnership with Sony, Universal, Warner, and Merlin, the streamer said it would develop “responsible AI” products that not only respect copyright, but also allow the artists to choose whether they want to allow the use of AI tools.\nThe company didn’t delve into the specifics of how the new tools would operate, but the company already offers generative AI experiences for users, including with its AI DJ that plays a personalized selection of songs and others that allow users to request playlists using AI prompts, for instance.\nSpotify was recently criticized for allowing an AI-generated band’s music to go viral on its service, raising questions about whether the future of music would push human artistry to the side.\nLast month, the company revamped its AI policy to cut down on spam, particularly users who upload AI content at mass scale, create duplicates, and manipulate the search and recommendations systems. Spotify also said it would adopt the music labeling system DDEX to label when AI was used as part of the music creation process.\nThe upcoming GenAI features follow that promise by allowing artists to opt in to using AI tools if they choose. In all likelihood, the upcoming system would allow artists to identify when their music is used in AI-generated tracks and collect some sort of payment. Spotify notes the system will expand beyond artists to include other rights holders and distributors over time.\n“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential,” Spotify shared in its announcement. “If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rights holders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development,” it read.\nIn addition, Spotify said it has begun building a generative AI research lab and product team focused on building out new technologies that reflect its principles that artists should be able to choose if and how they participate in the AI music ecosystem. It says work on the first products has already started, and more tools will be on the way. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

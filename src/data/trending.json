    "body": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'8 hours agoPallab GhoshKPNO/NOIRLabA lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the UniverseThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space.An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\".The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.NASA/ESAThese are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speedWhat is dark energy?Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity.Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\".Eventually, some astronomers thought the expansion would slow down under the force of gravity and then slowly collapse in on itself, something they called the Big Crunch.Tentative results this year now support this theory.The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lehav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project.\"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says.Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly.\"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together.\"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility.\"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee.Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\"The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy.But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.\"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley LabA cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a timeSince the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial.Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts.Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director.\"Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?\" he says. \"Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one.\"Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?\"",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG), on its first trip following the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation for the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of Papua New Guinea, around 30km (18 miles) from city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said they had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added they were monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident. The 12-day voyage was due to finish on 30 December. The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by AMSA and Queensland Police, after the death of Suzanne Rees, the 80-year-old passenger who was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.Ms Rees had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".AMSA was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "2 hours agoThe Observer leads with the headline \"War and peace\" in Ukraine, filling their front page with a striking image of a woman carrying a Christmas tree and walking past the rubble of a bombed-out building. A sub-headline updates readers with the latest that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to meet with Donald Trump on Sunday in Florida discuss a new 20-point peace plan agreed by American and Ukrainian envoys.Closer to home, Sir Keir Starmer has welcomed the arrival of British-Egyptian writer and pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah in the UK, the Sunday Telegraph reports. The paper says the prime minister is \"delighted\" that Abdel Fattah has been reunited with his loved ones following his years in jail, including on charges of spreading fake news. But the paper points out that Conservative Robert Jenrick said it was an error of judgement to welcome the arrival of \"the awful extremist\".  Elsewhere, a photo of Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay's wedding is front and centre after the pair got hitched at Bath Abbey.\"Abbey ever after\" is the Sunday Times' take on the Peaty-Ramsay wedding. Alongside, the paper reports that the prime minister nominated a former adviser for peerage despite knowing he had once campaigned for a councillor who had been charged with child sex offences. Matthew Doyle, who was the Downing Street director of communications, left his role in March.Staying with the PM, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned Sir Keir is \"in trouble\" and could face a leadership challenge if Labour perform poorly in next year's May elections, according to the Sunday Express. Badenoch added that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has only kept her job because if she is ousted the prime minister will also \"have to go\", the paper says.In royal news, the Mail on Sunday says Prince William is facing backlash from neighbours over a \"ring of steel\" security zone around his family's new home in Windsor. The paper reports locals are feeling \"ambushed\" into accepting the security measures that include fencing with CCTV cameras and numerous no-entry. The paper says the measures have \"cut a gouge\" through Windsor Great Park.A poll conducted by the Sunday Mirror reveals some 64% of Britons are in favour of an Australian-style social media ban for under-16s. The paper quotes Labour MP Joani Reid, who is also chairwoman of the Children's Online Safety Group, who says \"the public is well ahead of the political debate\".In a \"touching tribute\" at Liverpool's Anfield stadium, the late footballer Diogo Jota's young sons joined their dad's teammates and family on the field as mascots before Saturday's match against Wolves. It was the first meeting between Jota's two former teams since his death. The headline \"They'll never walk alone\" is a reference to the club's famous anthem which is always played prior to kick-off.Finally, the Sun leads with the news that ice skating legends Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean will be given a damehood and knighthood in the King's New Year Honours, to be officially announced this week. The pair won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics and continued to delight fans after they retired as judges, trainers and performers on ITV show Dancing on Ice.Most of the papers look ahead to Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky meeting in Florida to discuss the latest plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.The Observer says the two leaders are seeking a \"New Year's resolution\". The paper also reports that Zelensky has said he's feeling \"hopeful\". But the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday Express highlight intense Russian attacks on Kyiv in the run up to these talks.In its assessment the Sunday Times says the \"peace process may be unlikely to succeed\" but it goes on to say that even without a deal \"the war may decline in tempo and intensity\" as exhaustion sets in.According to the Sunday Mirror, there's an appetite in Britain to follow Australia's lead and introduce a social media ban for under-16s. The paper has conducted a poll which says 64% of those surveyed support such a move. The government has previously said it would closely monitor the roll-out of the policy in Australia.The Sunday Times highlights a new drug for severe asthma that only needs to be administered twice a year which is due to be made available to British patients privately within months. Experts have said the drug has the power to \"transform lives\". Existing treatments have to be taken every two, four or eight weeks. The paper says Depemokimab, which has been developed by the pharmaceutical giant GSK, has also been found to reduce by 72% the number of asthma attacks that need treatment in hospital.The ice skating champions Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean are due to be given a damehood and a knighthood in the King's New Year's Honours, reports the Sun on Sunday. The pair, who won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics, retired from performing together earlier this year.Photographs from the wedding of the Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay at Bath Abbey feature in most of the papers. The Sunday Telegraph says the couple have \"taken the plunge\". The Sunday Express says the ceremony was \"swimming with stars\", including Sir David Beckham.Many of the papers reflect on the emotional scenes at Anfield yesterday as football fans paid tribute to the late Diogo Jota. It was the first time his two former sides, Liverpool and Wolves, had played each other since his death in a car crash in July. Two of his young children joined the match day mascots on the pitch before their Premier League game. The Sun on Sunday notes that his widow was watching from the stands. \"They'll never walk alone\" says the Daily Star.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanThe UK is to impose visa restrictions against people arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo after its government failed to agree to measures allowing the return of illegal migrants and foreign national offenders. Ministers say the DRC has not made changes required under the toughening up of the UK's asylum rules announced in November.Fast-track visa processes will no longer apply to people from the country, while the Home Office said VIPs and politicians would no longer get preferential treatment when coming to the UK.Meanwhile, the Home Office said Angola and Namibia had agreed to step up efforts to take back their citizens, having been threatened with sanctions alongside the DRC.A government source said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood would not hesitate to ban visas for other countries refusing to take citizens back.The Home Office said Angola and Namibia agreeing to improve their processes marked the \"first delivery success from last month's asylum reforms\".The government had warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo if their governments did not rapidly improve co-operation on removals.A Home Office source said the agreements could see thousands of people removed and deported.Under the government's changes to the UK's asylum system, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Announcing the changes last month, Mahmood had warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto.It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".It said there had been some engagement by the DRC but \"unless co-operation rapidly improves\" further measures could be imposed, including the possibility of a complete visa ban on people from the country coming to the UK.Home Secretary Mahmood said: \"We expect countries to play by the rules. If one of their citizens has no right to be here, they must take them back.\"I thank Angola and Namibia and welcome their co-operation. Now is the time for the Democratic Republic of Congo to do the right thing. Take your citizens back or lose the privilege of entering our country.\"",

    "body": "The head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.In his letter, Richard Grenell, said the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members, and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board. Grenell, the Trump Kennedy Center president, wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show \"is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name on the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

    "body": "4 days agoLizzy BellaandGeorgia Levy-Collins,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesJeremiah Azu ran for Team GB in the men's 100m semi-final at the World Athletics Championships Tokyo 2025When Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi scored against Arsenal on Tuesday night, he did what he often does - point to the sky.Arsenal's Jurrien Timber - nicknamed 'Pastor Timber' by fans - followed suit when he scored in the penalty shoot-out at the end of the game. Both teams have influential players who have recently been discussing the importance of their Christian beliefs.And it's not just in football where we've seen contrasting headlines about professional athletes displaying their faith.Earlier this year, at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, GB sprinter Jeremiah Azu was warned not to wear a \"100% Jesus\" headband.But can your beliefs impact your performance - and how you are treated - in the sport you play? ReutersCrystal Palace's Marc Guehi celebrates scoring against Arsenal at Emirates StadiumSport governing bodies often have rules against displaying religious and political slogans during competition.Jeremiah wasn't formally punished for wearing his \"100% Jesus\" headband in a 400m semi-final, but World Athletics bosses said they spoke to his team about the accessory.The 24-year-old says he now backs the rules separating religion from the track, but he's glad he did it.He tells BBC Newsbeat he believes his \"strength\" comes from his faith, and he wore the headband to show that.His father is a pastor, so Jeremiah says religion has always been a part of his life.\"We read the Bible at home, we prayed at home,\" he recalls. He says his religion helps his performance in athletics. \"As a Christian you have to be disciplined,\" he says, a trait he feels transfers over to track and field.\"There's days where it's difficult to push, but I know I have to from the discipline I've got from my faith,\" he explains. Semi-pro footballers Zainab El-Mouden (left) and Jaiden Chang-Brown are both devoted to their religions  Though Jeremiah says he's never felt \"muted\" when talking about his faith, up-and-coming athletes tell Newsbeat it's not always that simple. Semi-pro footballer Zainab El-Mouden, who plays for Chesham United FC Women,  says there are challenges as a female Muslim player who wears a hijab. The garment is worn over the head as a display of modesty, but it's not always been welcomed on the football pitch.It was banned by governing body Fifa until 2014, when players were permitted to wear it for religious reasons.And just two years ago, Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina, 27, made history by becoming the first player to wear a hijab at a World Cup.Zainab, 22, says her faith means everything to her, from the way she conducts herself to the way she dresses. She says it's been a real journey to become comfortable wearing a hijab while playing football. \"Initially I hated it, I hated the way it looked on me,\" she says.\"My hijab was my biggest insecurity and then it became my biggest strength.\"Whether you want to or not, you're going see me and you're gonna watch me more than anyone else.\"Zainab feels there is still a difference in how male Muslim players are treated compared with female players. \"With a female Muslim player, they're visibly different so that's where I think the rift kind of comes in,\" she says.After growing up with no one that \"looked like\" her in football to inspire her, Zainab says she wants to be that role model for others.\"All the girls that are growing up now need that representation to play,\" she says.Does faith impact your performance in sport ?There are studies on how a positive mindset and confidence can influence your performance.Religion isn't always part of it - many athletes have rituals they \"must\" follow before a big game or race to centre themselves.  Some report that their faith forms part of preparations for a big event.A Seoul University study published in 2000, based on interviews with 180 sports people across 41 sports, identified prayer as one of seven main \"coping strategies\" those surveyed used to combat anxiety before a big event.It suggested this could have a positive effect on their performance.Semi-professional footballer Jaiden Chang-Brown, of Lingfield FC, tells Newsbeat his faith has helped him to manage his emotions in a slightly different way.\"I feel like sometimes my passion could get the better of me in the past,\" he says.\"Sometimes I would lash out at teammates.\"It's really helped just to give me peace when I'm on the pitch.\"Jaiden says his faith has helped him to improve his mindset and \"tap into that psychological side of football\" when he plays.The 21-year-old describes himself as a \"born-again Christian\" and says his religion is the most important thing in his life.\"It's bigger than football, it's bigger than everything,\" he says.\"People think it's not cool to be bold in your faith, but it is.\"You can laugh and have your giggles, but it's what I believe in.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanSir Keir Starmer has been criticised for welcoming the arrival of Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah to the UK - after historical social media messages emerged showing the campaigner apparently calling for Zionists to be killed.The dual British national left Egypt this week after being freed from prison. He was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" after sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country.The prime minister said he was \"delighted\" to hear the activist had landed in the UK to be reunited with family.But shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said Sir Keir's remarks were a \"serious error of judgement\".Jenrick highlighted Abdel Fattah's messages that endorsed the killing of Zionists and police, and added the prime minister's message amounted to a \"personal, public endorsement\" of the activist.\"Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily, nor for peaceful dissent. But neither should the prime minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed,\" he said in a letter.Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Justice Secretary David Lammy, also published similar posts of support after Abdel Fattah's return.The Jewish Leadership Council, a charity representing Jewish organisations across the UK, criticised what it described as an \"effusive welcome\" from the UK government.The BBC understands the activist's messages had not been brought to attention of the prime minister until they were highlighted in recent days - and the government considers them to be abhorrent. Abdel Fattah's release in September followed a long campaign by his family - backed by celebrities such as actresses Dame Judi Dench and Olivia Colman - and lobbying by the British government.He had spent more than a decade of his life behind bars, including being handed a five-year sentence in December 2021 following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.The previous Conservative administration had also lobbied for the activist to be freed and a government spokesman said: \"He is a British citizen. It has been a long-standing priority under successive governments to work for his release from detention, and to see him reunited with his family in the UK.\"A Labour source also accused Jenrick of trying to rewrite history for his own political advantage.A writer, intellectual and software developer, Abdel Fattah rose to prominence during an uprising in 2011 that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.In 2014, Abdel Fattah was nominated for a European human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, but this was withdrawn over tweets about Israel he had posted in 2012.He said his comments had been part of a \"private conversation\" that took place during an Israeli offensive in Gaza and had been been taken out of context.After being removed from a travel ban list imposed by Egyptian authorities that kept him in the country for three months after his release from jail, Abdel Fattah has now reunited with his 14-year-old son, who lives in Brighton.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo in October after his release, he had said:  \"I'm learning how to get back into life.\"He added: \"I'm doing much better than I would have expected. Much better than most people would have expected.\"",

    "body": "World number one Luke Littler produced a dominant performance to book a spot in the last 16 at the PDC World Championship, but fourth seed Stephen Bunting became the highest-ranked player to exit this year's tournament.Littler averaged more than 107 and lost just three legs in a 4-0 win over Austria's Mensur Suljovic, demonstrating why he is the man to beat at Alexandra Palace.The 18-year-old from Warrington is bidding to retain his PDC world crown - a feat that has not been achieved since Scotland's Gary Anderson won back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016.Littler was seeded to meet Bunting in the semi-finals, but the world number four was defeated in a deciding set by world number 63 and fellow Englishman James Hurrell.Bunting, twice a semi-finalist at Alexandra Palace, was not at his best but found clinical ton-plus finishes at the right times to take the match all the way to a seventh set.But Hurrell maintained a solid level of form throughout and emerged victorious, ending the match with a 100 checkout.The 41-year-old is provisionally into the top 50 of the PDC world rankings as a result of his run at Alexandra Palace and his fourth-round opponent will be the winner of Sunday's match between Germany's Martin Schindler and England's Ryan Searle.Some of the build-up to Littler's third-round match focused on how he would cope with Suljovic's slower style, which had irked the Austrian's second-round opponent Joe Cullen.If there was any concern that it would be an issue for the teenager, that soon disappeared.Suljovic did not have a dart at a double in any of the first seven legs, let alone win one. Leaving the stage at the end of the second set, he walked off with a big smile and his arms outstretched, as if to say to his followers that he had no answer to Littler's brilliance.The former World Matchplay finalist eventually earned his first leg of the match in the third set, but Littler ensured his record of not dropping a set in this tournament would remain intact.Littler told Sky Sports: \"I'm really happy. The finishing was good - 71%, I don't think I've seen that in my PDC career.\"I felt so settled tonight. Mensur at his pace, I kind of got myself into a rhythm that matches it - slower than usual but it worked out.\"That's the best I've felt [at the World Championship], I think even last year's tournament and the one before that. That's the most I've been settled and it shows with the average, the finishing and the ton-plus checkouts.\"Littler will play either Australia's Damon Heta or England's 2018 world champion Rob Cross in the fourth round.In Saturday's afternoon session, fifth seed Jonny Clayton needed a deciding set to overcome world number 44 Niels Zonneveld.The first six sets of a high-quality match all went with the throw, with Clayton moving in front of Zonneveld on three separate occasions.The Dutch left-hander kept responding in an impressive display, but former Premier League champion Clayton found the key break of throw in the second leg of the deciding set before sealing victory.Welshman Clayton, 51, was back in action after a 12-day break, having received a bye through to round three because his second-round opponent Dom Taylor was suspended for failing a drugs test.In round four, Clayton will play Swedish debutant Andreas Harrysson, who defeated Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko 4-2 later on Saturday.Luke Woodhouse, the 25th seed, defeated fellow Englishman Andrew Gilding 4-1 to reach the fourth round for the second successive year.Woodhouse will next face Poland's Krzysztof Ratajski, who beat Dutchman Wesley Plaisier in a deciding set having trailed 3-1.Six more third-round matches are scheduled for Sunday, with four former world champions - Luke Humphries, Michael van Gerwen, Gary Anderson and Cross - among those hoping to secure spots in the last 16.Wesley Plaisier 3-4 Krzysztof RatajskiAndrew Gilding 1-4 Luke WoodhouseJonny Clayton 4-3 Niels ZonneveldAndreas Harrysson 4-2 Ricardo PietreczkoStephen Bunting 3-4 James HurrellLuke Littler 4-0 Mensur SuljovicFrom 12:30 GMT:Martin Schindler v Ryan SearleDamon Heta v Rob CrossGary Anderson v Jermaine WattimenaFrom 19:00 GMT:Gian van Veen v Madars RazmaLuke Humphries v Gabriel ClemensMichael van Gerwen v Arno Merk",

    "body": "'I was homeless but ice skating changed my life'5 days agoTom MacDougallYorkshireProvidedCharlie, who is supported by the charity Roundabout, said ice skating had helped him to express himselfWhen Charlie was 21 years old, he attempted to take his own life after becoming homeless for the third time. The 23-year-old has since represented Great Britain in international ice skating, saying the sport has \"changed his life\".Charlie, originally from Brighton, moved in with his grandmother when he was 13 after feeling pressure to come out as gay, which created a rift with his family.After his grandmother died when he was 17, he became homeless for the first time and would sleep on friends' sofas.He eventually got a private tenancy, but was unable to keep up with the cost of the rent, which led to him becoming homeless again.\"I really struggled with the instability of sofa-surfing, especially after having my own place and living independently,\" he said.\"It felt like a step backwards and it was much harder than I anticipated going back to a lifestyle I thought I'd left behind -  it felt like it was never going to end.\"In 2023, he moved to Sheffield with his boyfriend, but became homeless for the third time after the relationship broke down.During this period, he attempted to take his own life.He was referred to the South Yorkshire youth homelessness charity Roundabout, which assigned him a flat - in which he still lives - and gave him access to a counselling service.\"I've thrived as a person up in Sheffield, down south I'm just a shell and don't feel like a person or appreciated, but up here I have so much more to live for and I'm treated with respect,\" he said.ProvidedCharlie said his dream was to take part in the OlympicsHe said he felt \"lonely\" after moving into the flat and decided to try ice skating to \"make some friends\".\"I very quickly got addicted to it and wanted to do competitions,\" he said.Charlie represented Great Britain at the Celje Ice Cup in Slovenia last month.He won gold medals in the artistic performance and free skating categories, and hopes to one day make it to the Olympics.\"It isn't just about skating though - it's taught me discipline and respect for myself,\" he said.\"It's helped me understand my feelings and how to portray them, it's so hard to open up about how I feel, but I can express who I am through my skating.\"He now practises for 20 hours every week alongside working and studying at Doncaster College.\"I train mainly at Ice Sheffield and it's crazy to think that I have come this far in two years,\" he said.\"I wasn't expecting a medal at all and even when I heard the scores I had to check online to make sure I really had won - I didn't think I'd do so well.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.More stories like this",

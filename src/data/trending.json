The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

His kindness and love will forever be part of his legacy.\"We kindly ask that our privacy be respected as we navigate this unimaginable grief. William will always be loved, always missed, and forever in our hearts.\"Fellow Coronation Street stars left supportive messages on her post, with Sally Dynevor saying she was \"so shocked to hear this news\" and describing William as a \"beautiful boy\".Actor Jack P Shepherd said: \"Terrible to read that Debbie. Devastating news, thinking of you all,\" while Shobna Gulati wrote: \"Sending you all the love, I'm so sorry and my deepest sympathies.\"Chelsee Healey, who also appeared in Waterloo road, posted: \"My heart breaks for you all, I'm so so sorry.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe firm behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is merging with a Google-backed energy company in a deal valued at more than $6bn (£4.4bn).Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and TAE Technologies announced the plans on Thursday in a joint statement, which said the move would \"create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies\".Fusion power is a method of generating energy from heat released by nuclear fusion reactions. It could release vast amounts of energy with little associated radioactivity.The statement said the combined company planned to begin constructing the \"world's first utility-scale fusion power plant\" next year, with further plants to follow.Under the merger both firms will have an equal 50% share in ownership after the deal is completed, which is expected by mid-2026 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.TAE Technologies provides technology for energy storage and power delivery systems for batteries and electric vehicles. Its umbrella organisation, TAE Life Sciences, develops technologies and drugs for treating cancer patients.The tie-up with the firm signals a bold and surprising shift for Trump Media, as it moves from social media and financial offerings into the energy sector. Devin Nunes, chairman and chief executive of TMTG, said his firm was \"taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations\". Calling fusion power the \"most dramatic energy breakthrough\" since the 1950s, he said his firm would bring \"the capital and public market access\" to help make TAE's technology commercial viable. Surging electricity demand for AI data centers has revived interest in cleaner and reliable nuclear power, including restarting shuttered reactors, expanding existing ones and signing contracts for future small modular reactors.The joint statement said TAE Technologies had raised more than $1.3bn of funding from other investors including Google and Goldman Sachs.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByTom ReynoldsBBC SportSir Chris Hoy is in his kitchen, chatting about early-morning coffee and fry-ups.And mindsets.An Olympic champion's mindset to be exact.An exacting, leave-no-stone-unturned, meticulous mindset that defined a career in which he won six gold medals and one silver across four Olympic Games.This is the same mindset he is relying on more than ever to reframe his entire existence and purpose following a terminal cancer diagnosis.\"We normally have a fry-up for breakfast but, when you guys are here, we need to make an effort,\" he jokes.The \"you\" in this instance are the BBC cameras that have been following Hoy and his family and friends for the past 12 months for the documentary Sir Chris Hoy: Cancer, Courage and Me.The programme will be broadcast for the first time at 21:00 GMT on Thursday, 18 December on BBC One and available from 22:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.It shows a hopeful, yet raw, portrayal of the realities of living with stage four cancer, while it also brings to life Hoy's realisation that he can use his platform as a force for raising awareness, and money, for other people living with the illness.Media caption, Sir Chris Hoy: Cancer, Courage & MeAs he weighs his coffee – perhaps the number one area where Hoy's obsessive eye for detail manifests itself – the Scot is in an upbeat mood, laughing and joking with wife Sarra about their imagined usual morning scenario of a full English breakfast compared to the omelette and green homemade smoothie they are actually tucking into.It has not been anywhere near this rosy for much of the past two years, however, as Hoy explains a few minutes later when the cameras are rolling properly.\"It's about five miles from the hospital back home,\" he says, describing his return journey from seeing doctors after learning of his cancer diagnosis in September 2023. \"I just walked back in a daze. I don't remember the walk. I was just thinking, how am I going to tell Sarra? What am I going to say?\"As soon as I said the words, I broke down.\"What Hoy had to articulate was a terminal cancer diagnosis. Incurable secondary bone cancer. Between two and four years to live.\"In my sporting career it used to be about process, not outcome,\" he says. \"Focus on what you have control over. But if you win or lose, it's not life and death.\"[After the diagnosis] the stakes have changed dramatically. The principle is the same – but now it is life and death.\"Hoy has shrewdly taken on support for this difficult time in his life.Steve Peters is a man that Hoy knew could make a difference.The list of sportspeople that Peters has worked with - the public list he is happy to talk about on the record - is a high-profile 'who's who' ranging from Steven Gerrard to Ronnie O'Sullivan.The donkeys in the front paddock of the psychiatrist's countryside home bely that glitzy, glamourous list.But their tranquil nature make complete sense when you spend a few hours in the company of Peters and Hoy.Peters was Hoy's first port of call throughout his career when it came to training and calming his mind to be at its peak in and around Olympic competition.He was also one of the first people Hoy called when he got his terminal diagnosis last year.At first Peters was part of the firefighting phase of what Hoy's wife Sarra describes as a \"deep grief\" in the first few days post-diagnosis.But in time, with Peters' help, Hoy set about finding a new purpose.Firstly, it is to raise awareness of the limitations of the current provision for prostate cancer in the UK. Both Hoy's father and grandfather have had prostate cancer.Understandably, given an earlier diagnosis could have shifted his diagnosis from terminal to manageable, the 49-year-old Scot argues eloquently that a national screening programme should be made a priority for men from their 45th birthday onwards.But, crucially, his approach is also to show other people living with cancer that sport and exercise can still be a positive part of their lives, even through their treatment.Peters explains: \"What Chris did when he was presented with this illness is he said: 'Right, what's the plan?' After we worked through the initial stages of the shock and grief of it, then he came out the other side and he picked up on the purpose.\"And that was to reach other people. It became a mission for him.\"Media caption, Sir Chris Hoy and his wife Lady Sarra recall the night they metPeters knows all too well how unstoppable Hoy can be when a mission takes him over.The pair have now worked together for more than 20 years, with perhaps their crowning moment coming at the Athens 2004 Games.It was in the Greek capital that Peters' \"pink elephant\" technique helped Hoy win his first Olympic gold. In the run-up to Athens, Peters had encouraged Hoy to pre-empt a scenario in which his rivals broke the world record in the men's kilometre time trial before the Scot had his chance to ride. The scenario became reality on three occasions, but rather than falter, Hoy, the last to ride, responded with a world record of his own to take gold.The mindset of that moment is one he is tapping into again with his approach to cancer. Control the controllables, but don't waste time worrying about the end result.Just like in Athens.\"As I went to the start line, a personal best would have got me third,\" Hoy remembers.\"Recognising what you have control over is such an important part of life. Focus on what you have control over - but the outcome itself, you don't have control over.\"Steve helped me to access the best of myself, and get the best out of myself.\"The BBC Breakfast and BBC Sport cameras witnessed Hoy, with the help of Lady Sarra - who herself is dealing with her own diagnosis of multiple sclerosis - making the best of his cancer diagnosis in the last 12 months.They have followed Hoy and his family to doctor and physio appointments and out on mountain bike rides in Wales with a GB Olympic cycling A-list group of riders and friends.That same cast list turned out in Glasgow in September as Hoy and a host of his supporters took his cycling fundraising event the Tour de Four from concept to delivery inside a few months.'Overwhelming' response to Hoy missionMedia caption, Murray and Kennys on discovering 'superhero' Hoy’s cancer diagnosisIt is just after 9am in a back room of the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow – a few minutes before Hoy's charity mass participation cycling event, the Tour de Four, is due to get under way.The ride was set up, and given its title, in an effort to change perceptions around stage four cancer.Every time the door opens, a member of British Olympic and Paralympic royalty walks through it.Sir Mark Cavendish, Sir Jason Kenny, Becky James, Dani King, Sir Ben Ainslie, Sir Steve Redgrave, Dame Sarah Storey...In and among the clip-clop of cycling cleats comes another sporting knight.This one is wearing tennis shoes.Hoy goes over to check in with Sir Andy Murray about his readiness and is met with a typical sardonic quip from his fellow Scot.Hoy asks: \"Are you feeling ready mate?\"\"Well, I've got the kit,\" Murray responds.As it turns out, the two-time Wimbledon champion was woefully ill-prepared – completing the ride in tennis shoes and boxer shorts. Not typical road cycling gear, but typical of the response of Hoy's friends to his diagnosis.\"The response of friends has been quite overwhelming at times,\" Hoy says.The friend response has been mirrored by that of the public.September's Tour de Four raised more than £3m for cancer charities across the UK.However, the highs of that success were followed in November by the UK National Screening Committee's recommendation that a prostate screening cancer programme for all men in the UK was not justified.For Hoy, the fight to raise money and raise awareness is his new Olympic-sized mission and his response therefore was dignified, yet resolutely determined.\"I was quite astonished,\" he said. \"I can't believe that the answer to this situation is to sit on your hands and do nothing. There are 10,000 men a year in the UK who find out they have prostate cancer too late – it's incurable.\"We're failing these men if we don't do something proactive. Regardless, I'm going to keep pushing.\"Again, we meet his Olympic-honed mindset, targeted on a bigger mission.\"The Olympics was something that was my life for so many years and drove me on,\" Hoy says.\"I'm still incredibly proud of it now and I look back with great fondness, but this is something on an entirely different level.\"It's more important than riding bikes in anti-clockwise circles, put it that way.\"Media caption, Sir Chris Hoy on his BBC documentary and 'speaking to the world'You can watch Sir Chris Hoy: Cancer, Courage & Me on Thursday, 18 December at 21:00 GMT on BBC One, and from 22:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.Insight: In-depth stories from the world of sportCycling",

    "body": "1 hour agoEmilia BelliWales Westminster correspondentThe government has paused all testing of Ajax armoured vehicles after another soldier was injured during safety trials.Three separate investigations are currently being conducted after around 30 soldiers became ill from noise and vibration during a training exercise in November.Twenty-three vehicles used on the exercise were already suspended for use due to the injuries, with the results of inspections on them to be published in the New Year.In a written statement to Parliament, defence minister Luke Pollard said the latest report of a soldier becoming ill from vibration came during additional safety trials intended to provide more information for the investigations.The defence minister said the soldier did not require hospitalisation, and the vehicle they were in - which is not one of the 23 already suspended - is undergoing a \"thorough investigation\".He said: \"This additional report of an injury is a serious concern to me so, out of an abundance of caution and to ensure the safety of our personnel, I have directed a pause on all Ajax trials.\"\"This is in addition to the ongoing pause for training and exercising.\"He said he would assess if trials could be restarted in the New Year.The minister added that investigation teams must be given \"time and space required to ensure all information and evidence is considered\" and that he had met with the vehicle's builder General Dynamics last week.Responding to the announcement, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told the BBC the most important thing was to \"make sure that equipment that's being supplied is safe\".\"The government has undertaken a review,\" she said.\"There are several reviews going on into the problems that have been reported.\"I can't really comment whilst those reviews are underway, but I'm very conscious that General Dynamics is a very important employer in Wales, and particularly in the constituency in Merthyr Tydfil.\"So we'll wait and see what happens with the review. But absolutely paramount to this is that the equipment that is provided is safe for use.\"The multi-million pound Ajax vehicles, made in Merthyr Tydfil by General Dynamics, were originally due to enter service in 2017, delivering 589 vehicles.The £6.3bn programme has been beset by problems and repeated delays, as noise and vibration have injured soldiers who have tested the vehicles.Pollard previously said he was \"disgusted\" that soldiers were injured after he had been assured the armoured vehicles were safe.There are currently three investigations ongoing, by the Defence Accident Investigation Branch, the Army's safety investigation team and a ministerial review.Regular meetings have also been held between the minister, chief of general staff, the Army and officials, according to the statement.The BBC understands General Dynamics representatives have also met with backbench MPs in recent days.MPs have previously raised concerns about uncertainty around the programme having an impact on jobs in their constituencies.Pollard said findings from the investigations into Ajax vehicles would impact on decisions in the UK government's defence investment plan.Earlier this week Defence Secretary John Healey said \"programmes beset by deep-running failures, such as Ajax\" had delayed the publication of the plan, which was due in the autumn.It was supposed to map out the spending needed to overhaul the armed forces, but will now be delayed to 2026.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentKing Charles successfully poured a \"perfect\" pint of Guinness on a Christmas visit to a new brewery in London's Covent Garden, where he tasted his pint-pulling efforts.This was his first public visit since the King's video message revealing \"good news\" about the positive progress of his cancer treatment - and he seemed to be really enjoying the moment.The King surprised some shoppers outside the event, wishing them a \"Merry Christmas\" and shaking hands in an impromptu walkabout in the rain.The King, who seemed in festive form, joked with carol singers that they must be \"moonlighting from the Royal Opera House\" and teased reporters that they were not getting to test the drinks on display.The King was opening the Guinness Open Gate Brewery, a £73m investment which will be a new London visitor attraction as well as producing a range of beers.There was a lesson in how to pour a pint, with the King shown how to tilt the glass to 45 degrees, and then to leave it to settle for between 60 to 70 seconds, which he was told allowed 300 million bubbles to rise inside the glass.It was not clear who had ever counted them, but the King was ready to raise a glass to Christmas and perhaps, he might have been thinking about \"good health\" in a more personal way.His pint-pulling trainer, Leo Ravina, said he had poured a \"perfect pint\". \"If you say so,\" replied the King, who wiped away a foamy Guinness moustache.The King seemed less convinced by another piece of hi-tech boozing, where he was shown how an image could be printed, using beetroot or carrot juice, on to the beer's surface.Although as monarch, he had to avoid sharing his point (or in this case pint) of view.There was also no mention of the social media fad of \"splitting the G\", where drinkers try to reach a certain point on a pint glass.But the King seemed to enjoy some of the less usual beers on offer, including one with an apricot flavour.This tasting session was in the 232 Bar, named after the temperature at which the barley is roasted to get the distinctive flavour.Guinness also gave the King a tour of the inner workings of the beer-making process.Despite the rain, the King seemed determined to go outside, where crowds appeared taken aback to see this unexpected visitor and held up their phones in the drizzle. He chatted to a couple about keeping their baby warm in the downpour.There was also a tour of a Christmas-themed food market.And among the guests was movie director Gurinder Chadha, who made Bend It Like Beckham and has now launched a modern version of A Christmas Carol, called Christmas Karma.It has a message about compassion and multicultural communities, and Ms Chadha said the King had asked for a copy of the film to watch at Christmas in Sandringham.The King was also introduced to young people who were being trained for the hospitality industry.Nik Jhangiani of Guinness's parent company Diageo welcomed the seasonal royal visit: \"Pubs and restaurants are the heartbeat of the hospitality sector and this is a wonderful show of support for the industry.\"",

Here she is showing her togetherness with her family.The photos appear to be from the same shoot used to capture photos for George's 12th and Louis' seventh birthdays.Last year, the couple revealed a Christmas card with a personal significance, using a picture taken from the video released when Catherine announced the end of her chemotherapy.In January, she announced she was in remission from cancer while making an emotional return to the hospital where she received treatment.A few months later William and Catherine celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary during an official visit to the Isle of Mull in Scotland.And in August the couple were preparing to move into their \"forever home\" in Forest Lodge, Windsor.William and Catherine are spending the festive season together and are expected to be joining the King and rest of the royal family at Sandringham in Norfolk on Christmas Day.Earlier this month, King Charles and Queen Camilla released their own Christmas card, showing them in Rome.The photograph, taken in April during their state visit to Italy, shows the smiling couple standing side by side on a garden path.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HousePresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order that would expand access to cannabis, a long anticipated move that would mark the most significant shift in US drug policy in decades. The order is expected to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I narcotic, to a Schedule III drug - placing it under the same category as Tylenol with codeine, US media reports suggest.Even if recategorised, cannabis will remain illegal at the federal level. But classifying it as a Schedule III narcotic would allow expanded research to be conducted into its potential benefits. Several Republican lawmakers have cautioned against the move, with some arguing it could normalise cannabis use. The US Drug Enforcement Agency notes that Schedule III narcotics - which also include ketamine and anabolic steroids - have only a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence\".The executive order could come as early as Thursday, although the timing could shift, CBS, the BBC's US partner, has reported.The new classification could also have tax implications for state-authorised cannabis dispensaries, as current regulations bar them from some tax deductions if they sell Schedule I products.Various US news outlets have reported that the announcement may also include a pilot programme that would see some older Americans reimbursed for cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, for conditions including cancer treatments. In recent years, a majority of US states have approved cannabis for some medical use, and nearly half - 24 - have legalised recreational use. But since 1971, cannabis has been  a Schedule I narcotic, which means it has no accepted medical use and a high potential to be abused.Earlier this week, Trump said that he was \"considering\" the re-classification because of \"tremendous amounts of research that can't be done unless you reclassify\". The Biden administration proposed a similar reclassification, and in April 2024 the DEA proposed a rule change, but got bogged down under administrative and legal issues. Trump has long expressed a desire to change US drug policy regarding cannabis. \"I believe it is time to end endless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,\" he wrote on Truth Social last year while running for president. \"We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested products,\" he said. The reclassification proposal has met some resistance from Republican lawmakers. On Wednesday, a group of 22 Republican Senators sent an open letter to the president, arguing that marijuana use would mean that \"we cannot re-industrialise America\". The Senators pointed to lingering concerns over the health impact of cannabis, as well as research suggesting that cannabis can be linked to \"impaired judgement\" and \"lack of concentration\".\"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\" In a separate letter sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi in August, nine Republican representatives argued that \"no adequate science or data\" exists to support the change. \"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter said. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"More broadly, polls show that a majority of Americans support efforts to legalise marijuana. One Gallup poll released in November found that 64% of Americans believe that it should be legalised, although support had drifted slightly from previous years because of a 13-point drop among Republicans.

    "body": "16 hours agoMoose Campbell/BBCThe Flamingo missile is a new, long-range Ukrainian cruise missile, designed for deep strikes against Russia with a range of up to 3,000km Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent in KyivWe're driven blindfolded to a secret location where Ukraine is making one of its latest weapons. We're told to turn off our phones - such is the secrecy around the production of Ukraine's Flamingo cruise missile.For Ukraine, dispersing and hiding the production of weapons like this is key to survival. Two factories belonging to the company that makes it - Fire Point - have already been hit.Inside the one we're visiting we're told not to film any features such as pillars, windows or ceilings. We're also asked not to show the faces of workers on the assembly line - where Flamingo missiles are at various stages of completion.Even under fire, Ukraine is ramping up its arms industry. President Volodymyr Zelensky says the country now produces more than 50% of the weapons it uses on the front line. Almost its entire inventory of long-range weapons is domestically made.At the start of the war Ukraine mostly relied on its old Soviet-era arsenal. Western military support helped modernise the country's armed forces, but it now leads much of the world in developing unmanned systems – like robots and drones.Now, domestically produced cruise missiles are adding to Ukraine's long-range capability.Moose Campbell/BBCUkraine builds the missiles in secret factories - the BBC team were blindfolded before they were taken thereIryna Terekh is the chief technical officer of Fire Point – one of Ukraine's largest drone and missile manufacturers whose Latin motto translates to \"if not us, then who\".The 33-year-old once studied architecture, but she is now trying to help dismantle the Russian war machine.She cuts a tiny figure in front of the giant Flamingo missile, which she tells me is painted black not pink (unlike early prototypes) \"because it eats Russian oil\".The end product looks similar to the German V1 rocket from World War Two. It consists of a large jet engine placed on top of a tube the length of a London bus. They've already been used in combat, though the company won't confirm specific targets.Moose Campbell/BBCIrena Terekh from Fire Point says the Flamingo missile is black because it \"eats Russian oil\"The Flamingo is the kind of deep-strike weapon that Western nations have been reluctant to supply. The cruise missile is said to have a range of 3,000km (1,900 miles). That's similar to a US-made Tomahawk – the more sophisticated and expensive weapon that US President Donald Trump refused to give Ukraine.But deep strikes are seen as a critical part of the war, for which Ukraine mainly uses long-range drones. It is still losing ground to Russia on a front line that stretches for more than a thousand kilometres. So Ukraine is increasingly trying to target Russia's war economy, to slow those advances. The head of Ukraine's Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, says Ukraine's long-range strikes have already cost the Russian economy more than $21.5bn this year.Moose Campbell/BBCThe name Flamingo is a reference to early prototypes of the missiles, which were painted pinkRuslan, an officer in Ukraine's Special Operations Forces, says the strategy is simple: \"To reduce the enemy's military capabilities and their economic potential.\" He says Ukraine's Special Operations Forces have carried out hundreds of strikes on oil refineries, weapons factories and ammunition dumps - deep inside enemy territory. Of course Russia has been doing the same, and on a greater scale. On average it has been launching around 200 Shahed drones a day; Ukraine's response has been about half that number.Nor is Russia limiting its strikes to military targets. Its long-range missile and drone attacks have led to massive power cuts right across the country – making life harder for millions of civilians. \"I'd like to launch as many drones as Russia does,\" Ruslan says. \"But we're scaling up very quickly\".Ms Terekh, of Fire Point, says Ukraine may not be able to match Russia's resources, but, she says, \"we are trying to fight with brains and tactics\". Denys Shtilerman, the chief designer and co-founder of the company, admits there is no \"Wunderwaffe\" – or wonder weapon. \"The game changer is our will to win,\" he says.Kevin McGregor/BBCRuslan, in Ukraine Special Operations Forces, says they're quickly scaling up domestic weapons manufacturingFire Point didn't even exist before Russia's full-scale invasion. But the start-up is now producing 200 drones a day. Its FP1 and FP2 drones, each the size of a small aeroplane, have carried out 60% of Ukraine's long-range strikes. Each drone costs around $50,000 - a third of the price of a Russian Shahed drone. Russia is still producing nearly 3,000 of those a month.Ukraine still needs outside help, not least with intelligence, targeting and money. But it is trying to be more self-sufficient. Ms Terekh says they've made a deliberate decision to source as many of their components as possible from within Ukraine. \"We are following the principle that no one can influence the weapons we build,\" she says. They avoid parts from two specific countries – China and the United States. Asked why there should be no American components, she says \"we're on an emotional roller coaster [with the US]. Tomorrow somebody may want to shut it down, and we would not be able to use our own weapons.\"Matthew Goddard/BBCFire Point now produces 200 drones a dayUntil the end of last year, under President Biden, the United States supplied nearly $70bn-worth of military support to Ukraine. That was soon stopped under President Trump – instead he has set up a scheme to allow European Nato to purchase US weapons. The US is no longer Ukraine's biggest military backer, and Europe has struggled to fill the gap left by America or to match its previous support.Concerns about future US support spills over into talk of future US security guarantees – a key issue of the current peace talks. Ms Terekh dismisses the ongoing negotiations as \"capitulation talks\", and says that Ukraine making its own weapons \"is the only way to really provide security guarantees\".The former architecture student also hopes that the rest of Europe will be watching, and learning lessons. \"We are a bloody example,\" she says, \"in terms of being prepared for war.\"Ms Terekh says she wants to shock them into action, and believes that if any other country had faced the same onslaught as Ukraine \"then they'd already have been conquered.\"Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Kyla Herrmannsen.",

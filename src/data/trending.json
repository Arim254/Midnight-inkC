Doctors need to know they will have jobs. And they need to know they will be paid what they're worth.\"</p><p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting, however, has been adamant that he will not negotiate on pay and, instead, his team have kept the talks centred on working conditions, exam fees, rotas and career progression.</p><p>It comes after resident doctors were awarded a 22% pay rise over the last two years, with another 5.4% increase this year.</p><p>The BMA says pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.</p><p>Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said: \"Training bottlenecks are a very real issue for resident doctors, which is why the government is already working on a range of measures to tackle them.\"</p><p>Alongside the additional 1,000 training places, he said steps were also being taken to prioritise UK graduates for posts.</p><p>\"The result is that current first-year doctors will emerge from their foundation training into a very different professional landscape from that which exists today,\" he added.</p></div>",

to the Israel-Gaza war. \nIt appears this is the closest both sides have come to a deal since the war began two years ago. But Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan - which Israel has agreed to and Hamas has partly agreed to - is really just a framework, only a few pages long. So will the talks survive the detail? Adam talks to Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, about how the next few days could play out?\nAnd, yet another French prime minister has resigned, less than a month after being appointed to the role. Sébastien Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years.  What does President Macron do now? Adam speaks to co-host of the Global Story Tristan Redman and Marion Solletty Politico’s editor-at-large in France. \nYou can listen the Oslo Accords Old Newscast here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lx690c\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

Governments must act faster and stronger in implementing proven tobacco-control policies,\" he added. </p></div><div><p>The vaping figures are an estimate since some countries - 109 in all, and many in African and South-East Asia - do not gather data. </p><p>According to the report, as of February this year, at least 86 million e-cigarette users were adults, mostly in high-income countries. </p><p>And at least 15 million teenagers aged between 13 and 15  already vape, based on surveys from 123 countries.</p><p>While many nations have made efforts to introduce e-cigarettes regulations to tackle child vaping in recent years, by the end of 2024, 62 countries still had no policy in place, and 74 countries had no minimum age at which e-cigarettes may be purchased, says the WHO. </p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, tobacco use has been decreasing - from an estimated 1.38 billion users in 2000 to 1.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Prevalence of tobacco use among women dropped the most - from 11% in 2010 to 6.6% in 2024. </p><p>Among men, the decrease was from 41.4% in 2010 to 32.5% in 2024.</p><p>But one in five adults globally still uses tobacco. </p><p>Smoking is linked to many diseases, including cancer. </p><p>Experts say vaping is far less harmful than cigarettes, and can help you quit smoking. It is not recommended for non-smokers. </p><p>E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco and do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most damaging elements in tobacco smoke. They contain nicotine, which can be addictive. </p></div></article>",

It was thought he had what it took to fix a discreet deal between the parties and save French politics from implosion.</p><p>But as it turns out, that wasn't the case. </p><p>Lecornu has arguably gone down in even more embarrassing circumstances than his two ill-fated predecessors.</p><p>At least Michel Barnier and François Bayrou both presided for a short while over their governments, and tabled a few ideas.</p><p>Lecornu, on the other hand, named his cabinet late Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had lost it. He didn't even get to make his inaugural address to parliament, which was planned for Tuesday. </p><p>His government lasted for precisely 14 hours.</p></div><div><p>The immediate cause of his calamitous fin de régime is now clear. It was the conservative Republicans party (LR) and their leader, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.</p><p>With its 40 or so MPs, the LR has become a key part of the centre-right alliance that is trying to run France.</p><p>Retailleau has made much of his presence in government about projecting himself and his party as natural candidates for the offices of state. </p><p>Earlier on Sunday, he'd told Lecornu that he was willing to stay on as minister. But within an hour of the cabinet being announced, he posted on social media that there'd been a change of heart: LR might not be joining after all. </p><p>Officially it was because Lecornu had done the dirty by naming former finance minister Bruno Le Maire as his pick for defence. </p><p>Le Maire - a former party colleague - is a particular bugbear of LR, partly because he betrayed them by joining Macron, and partly because they blame him for letting French debt spiral out of control when in control of the country's finances.</p><p>Either way, LR accuses Lecornu of hiding Le Maire's nomination - apparently Retailleau didn't learn of it until he turned on his television.</p><p>And at the end of Monday there was a new twist. Le Maire agreed not to become a minister and Macron gave his outgoing prime minister a last-minute reprieve of 48 hours, to see if he could persuade LR into the government. </p><p>So, the situation remains fluid.</p><p>Whatever happens, the deeper truth is that the more time passes, the harder it is going to be for anyone - even the most gifted of Macron acolytes - to set up a stable government.</p><p>Why? Because the more time passes, the closer France gets to its next big electoral moment – the 2027 French presidential election.  </p><p>So unpopular is Macron today that all who associate themselves with him risk a severe beating the next time the public gets a chance to vote.</p><p>As a result, the fractious centre-right alliance at the heart of Macron-land is now beginning to splinter.  </p><p>The LR are out, but many centrists are starting to mutter too. Even the president's onetime wunderkind former prime minister Gabriel Attal is keeping his distance.</p><p>If it feels like the twilight of an era, then that is what it is. The faithful are leaving, preparing for a world without Macron. It might not be so far away.</p></div>",

Epstein died in prison in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Family members of Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC they were grateful for the court's denial and committed to ensuring she served her full sentence. </p><p>The justice department did not immediately comment.</p><p>She was recently interviewed by federal agents in the US about what she knew as part of an inquiry into the sex-trafficking scheme and whether others could have been involved. </p><p>She was found guilty in 2021 of facilitating Epstein's abuse.

    "body": "<div><div><p>1 hour ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>Senior North America reporter</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The US Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday with a docket already full of potentially significant cases that could define the scope of Donald Trump's presidential authority - and the prospect of more to come.</p><p>In the eight months that Trump has been back in the White House, he has tested the limits of executive power, unilaterally implementing new policies, slashing federal budgets and workforce, and attempting to bring previously independent agencies and institutions more directly under his control.</p><p>The latest brewing legal battle comes from the president's attempts to take control of state National Guard units and deploy them in cities where he claims there is public unrest and rampant crime - over the objection of local and state officials.</p><p>In Oregon, a federal judge has issued orders blocking Trump's deployment of troops to Portland. An appeals court is set to review the move in the coming days.</p><p>\"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" Judge Karin Immergut, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, wrote in her Saturday opinion. </p><p>\"Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power - to the detriment of this nation.\"</p></div><div><p>Once the appellate court has its say, the Supreme Court could step in via its so-called \"shadow docket\", issuing a ruling that could curtail Trump's ability to use the military on US soil - or give him a free hand, at least temporarily.</p><p>Such reviews have become a more routine occurrence recently, as a majority of the Supreme Court justices, in response to emergency petitions from the Trump administration, has largely allowed the president's actions to move forward while legal challenges play out.</p><p>\"A tug of war between the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts is going to be a driving force in the coming term,\" Samuel Bray, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said at a briefing last month.</p><p>The court's reliance on this shadow docket has been criticised by left-leaning legal scholars and politicians as an improper use of the court's authority. Its orders have typically been short, offering limited legal reasoning and leaving lower-level judges with minimal guidance.</p><p>\"All Americans should be alarmed by the Supreme Court's growing reliance on its shadow docket to resolve controversial and high-profile cases without any transparency - no substantive explanations, oral arguments, or reasoning,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said earlier this year.</p><p>\"This further pushes the Court's deliberations and decisions out of view of public scrutiny and shields it from accountability.\"</p><p>In the coming months, however, the court is set tackle questions of presidential power – and other high-profile controversies - head on, hearing oral arguments and issuing full decisions on their merits.</p><p>\"It's not going to be able to get away with one-page orders that don't explain the reasoning,\" said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who specialises in the Supreme Court and US politics. \"If they're going to grant more power to the executive its going to have to explain why.\"</p><p>The court is already scheduled to consider whether federal laws that prohibits the president from removing members of agencies designed by Congress to be independent from presidential influence infringe on executive authority.</p><p>The justices will also hear arguments in an expedited review of Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her position as a governor on the influential Federal Reserve Board – a case that could dramatically increase the president's power over American economic policy.</p><p>The US – and global economy – is also front and centre as Supreme Court justices will have a chance to decide whether many of Trump's unilaterally imposed tariffs on foreign imports have adequate legal authority or should be voided.</p><p>The justices may also review Trump's attempts to unilaterally cut federal spending and fire lower-level government employees, as well as his aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p><p>While the court has not yet agreed to consider Trump's attempt to terminate automatic citizenship for those born on US soil, it could do so in the coming months.</p><p>\"The scope of executive power will be front and centre this term,\" said Professor Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School, in an email to the BBC.</p><p>\"The cases coming before the court will test the Trump administration's highest political and economic priorities, whether tariffs or birthright citizenship.</p><p>\"One question will be whether the justices will apply principles (eg the major questions doctrine) that it used to strike down signature Biden initiatives in a politically even-handed way.\"</p><p>The court used its newly fashioned \"major questions doctrine\" to stymie Biden's efforts at student loan forgiveness and environmental regulations, holding that Congress did not give him explicit authorisation to do so.</p><p>Presidential power is the central focus of this year's Supreme Court term but cases involving several hot-button political and cultural controversies are also scheduled in the coming months.</p><p>The court will review whether a Colorado ban on conversion therapy – a controversial practice that attempts to use counseling to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity – violates constitutional free speech protections.</p><p>Also on the docket are two cases involving state bans on transgender athletes in interscholastic sport competition.</p><p>A Republican congressman in Illinois is challenging a state law that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day.</p><p>A group of Louisiana conservatives have asked the court to strike down a provision of a voting rights law that requires states to draw congressional districts that guarantee Black voter representation equal to their population level.</p><p>And the Republican Party is targeting a decades-old law that prevents political candidates and parties from coordinating their campaign spending.</p><p>Over the past few years, this conservative-dominated Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to issue landmark new rulings that have dramatically shifted America's legal landscape.</p><p>On topics like abortion rights, federal regulatory authority and the consideration of race in college admissions, the court has reversed decades of existing precedent.</p><p>Those decisions have contributed to a public view of the Supreme Court that has become increasingly polarised along partisan lines.</p><p>In a recent Pew Foundation poll, opinions of the nation's highest legal body were split nearly evenly, with Republicans supportive and Democrats highly critical.</p><p>By the time the court issues its final decisions in this term, expected by the end of June next year, the 6-3 conservative majority on the court may have broken new ground, and once again fundamentally reshaped American law.</p><p><i>With additional reporting from Kayla Epstein.</i></p></div>",

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang. Authorities are in contact with all the hikers who are still trapped.</p></div><div><p>Nature photographer Dong Shuchang was among hundreds of tourists who flocked to the area during China's Golden Week holiday. </p><p>He was looking forward to capturing the Himalayan marvel from the Tibetan slopes, when the snowstorm hit just hours after his trek started on Saturday.</p><p>\"The lightning and thunderstorms would not stop. The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly. The route was very slippery. I kept falling because of the ice.\"</p><p>His group spent last night in a hotel room in Qudang, where they relied on a generator for electricity. </p><p>When they left the hotel this morning, the snowstorm had finally subsided.</p><p>\"We're just so relieved to get help and support,\" he said.</p><p>Chen Geshuang, who was part of Mr Dong's hiking group, said the snow was about a metre deep when the group started their retreat on Sunday.</p><p>\"All of us are experienced hikers,\" Ms Chen said. \"But this blizzard was still extremely difficult to deal with.

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Donald Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

The video has received significant attention from figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk since being uploaded, prompting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare the agency would target \"blatant fraud that seems to be rampant in Minnesota\".\nDespite the administration’s response to the story, some mainstream media outlets have not found evidence of fraud, while some conservatives feel the story has not had enough attention in the wider media. What’s the truth behind Nick Shirley’s claims and what does it mean for Minnesota and its Somali community?\nAnd, Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as New York mayor. He delivered a speech outside City Hall promising to show the world that America’s political Left can govern. What are the obstacles he’ll face in that journey as mayor, and how much will it hinge upon his relationship with Donald Trump?\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "5 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonSwiss prosecutors say the French managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people have been placed under criminal investigation.The blaze at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve injured 119 other people, officials have said. With many of the injured identified, families now face an agonising wait for information about those still missing.The bodies of two Swiss women aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men aged 18 and 16 were the first to be indentified and returned to their families, police said earlier.The likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation of how the fire began found. The French managers of Le Constellation are suspected of having committed homicide by negligence, causing bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in the canton of Valais said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.Further details about the identified victims, including names, have not been released.On Friday, police said 113 of the injured have been identified, and include 71 Swiss, 14 French and 11 Italian citizens.Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process was continuing on Saturday and should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "With the UK continuing to be in the grip of Arctic winds, snow has coated parts of the country, from Shetland to the south coast of England over the last few days.Sleet and snow showers on Thursday night created a visual treat for our BBC WeatherWatchers on Friday morning, and for some the wintry vistas kept the photos opportunities coming on Saturday too.The downside to the wintry weather were slippery roads, pavements and the inevitable disruption to travel. The Met Office issued an amber weather warning for snow up until midday on Saturday, and numerous yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued for the coming days.The frigid conditions are set to persist by day and night into next week. Overnight snow showers may lead to disruption for the first proper commute of the year on Monday. Atlantic weather fronts clashing with the cold air may cause further issues as we head through the week too.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHayley CoyleYorkshireBBCSir Patrick Duffy died on 2 January after a short illnessThe oldest former Member of Parliament, Sir Patrick Duffy, has died aged 105 following a short illness. The miner's son, from Doncaster, first stood for parliament in 1950 and held the  Sheffield Attercliffe seat for Labour between 1970 and his retirement in 1992.Sir Patrick died on 2 January at Doncaster Royal Infirmary and a family friend said everyone who knew him, \"across all age groups\", would miss his kindness and humour.Kevin Meagher, who helped him write his second book, called him a \"living historical jukebox\" and added: \"Patrick's was a life well-lived, brimming with achievement, the admiration of colleagues and the love and affection of his many family and friends.\" Sir Patrick was born in Wigan in 1920 before his family moved to Doncaster for work in the South Yorkshire coalfield, where his father, James, was a miner.He told friends some of his earliest memories were the mining strikes of 1926, and according to the Guardian, he said he was a \"political animal\" from the age of five. Sir Patrick went on to serve in the Fleet Air Arm during World War Two and survived a terrible crash at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands - he was even read his last rites twice age 23 but went on to fly again. The crash also left him with severe facial injuries which required him to undergo experimental plastic surgery. After the war, Sir Patrick studied at the London School of Economics before taking a doctorate at Columbia University in New York and went on to become an economics lecturer at Leeds University. He first stood for Parliament in 1950 in Tiverton, Devon, and then successfully contested Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, in a by-election in 1963. He was a defence minister in James Callaghan's Labour government in the late 1970s and president of the NATO Assembly in the 1980s, working alongside many heads of state as the Cold War came to an end, including Pope John Paul II.In later life, Sir Patrick went on to hold a number of academic positions and remained a respected voice in the field of naval warfare. A committed Catholic, he received his papal knighthood in 2017 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991. Sir Patrick Duffy at the launch of his second book, From Wigan to Westminster age 103After retiring from Parliament, he undertook several pilgrimages including the famous Camino de Santiago, a 35-day walk of 15.5 miles (25km) each day, which he completed annually for six years.Mr Meagher also said: \"He could remember, you know, Oswald Mosley speaking in Wigan in 1930 and then pretty much everything in almost total recall on events from that point onwards, really - incredible mental acuity, even into a very old age.\"Sir Patrick published his second book, From Wigan to Westminster: Hot Wars, Cold Wars and the Carrier Strike Groups, aged 103, making him the second-oldest published author in the world.Paying tribute, Sally Jameson, MP for Doncaster Central, said: \"I am deeply saddened to hear that Sir Patrick Duffy has died.  \"He was loved in Doncaster and will be very much missed and my condolences go to all his family and friends.\"Mr Meagher added: \"He will be greatly missed. God rest his soul.\" Sir Patrick lived with his three beloved dogs in Doncaster near the colliery where his father worked and is survived by his sister Patricia.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesNetiv Haasara is a village just on the northern border of Gaza and was hit during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family who survived the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, after a team of journalists entered their badly-damaged home without permission.A BBC News crew, including International Editor Jeremy Bowen, entered the home of an Israeli family on the Gaza border and filmed inside the property in the days after the deadly attacks.They filmed personal photographs of the family's children at a time when many of their friends and relatives still didn't know whether they had survived, the Jewish News reported. A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "5 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and West reporterBBCDr Tori Herridge visited Kelvingrove Park to witness the skatepark excavation, When archaeologists began work on the site of Scotland's first skatepark last August, there was one prominent question being asked - when had the ground actually been filled in?It was a mystery solved through research, hard work - and a chocolate wrapper more than 40 years old.A team from the University of Glasgow team worked with volunteers and students to excavate the former Kelvin Wheelies park in Kelvingrove Park.Now the work on the skatepark will feature in an episode of the BBC's Digging For Britain programme, due to air 7 January.The skatepark opened in May 1978 and featured bowls, a slalom run and a half-pipe, all with names like Jaws, Torpedo and Bazooka.At the time it was considered state of the art and hosted events like the Scottish Skateboarding Championship, but several years later the site was out of commission, after a decline in popularity, concern about maintenance costs and safety risks.Exactly when it closed was a matter of debate, though.Speaking to Digging For Britain host Dr Tori Herridge, Dr Kenny Brophy of the university of Glasgow explained that while it was known that the skatepark was out of use by the early 1980s, an exact date had not been confirmed.He said: \"Even the smallest bit of evidence could help us say when this was backfilled, because there is actually no record of when this happened. Everyone is saying was it 1982 or 1983 or 1984, but no-one remembers exactly when. \"It's amazing how quickly people forget - archaeology can bring those memories back.\"Iain UrquhartThe skatepark was popular in the late 70s, but fell out of fashion a few years laterThe team, which included a number of modern skaters who use the current park at Kelvingrove - yards away from the original site - then got to work, using the same techniques that would be used on sites hundreds or thousands of years old.They analysed soil and rubble within the original slalom they discovered, while on another section members of the team discovered two white lines - which they eventually guessed was a way of telling skaters where to aim for when performing a trick.Skaters young and old gathered to appreciate the discovery - one younger skater said hearing about the old park was like \"hearing fairytales\" and like nothing she had ever skated on before.Another called the find interesting because skateboarding has changed so much, meaning parks like the 1970s one no longer exist.See Scotland's first skatepark in its 80s heydayFor Jamie Blair, who owns Glasgow skateboarding shop Clan Skates, the excavation brought back many memories.He was a member of the Kelvingrove skateboard team, and as a teenager would perform tricks and flips on a regular basis at the Kelvin Wheelies.     \"It was a great shame that this park got filled in, it broke a lot of skateboarders' hearts,\" he told Dr Herridge.\"It was good to roll back, and see it, and it was fun trying to find things you remembered from the past – 'oh, this is where that was…'  \"My other reaction was 'jeez, am I that old?' - I was literally digging up the bones of my childhood! But skateboarding is alive and well, so it's all good.\"The best before date of a chocolate biscuit provided evidence for when the park had closedHowever, it was later in the dig that the team were finally able to establish a more definitive date for when exactly the skatepark had closed.The solution involved Scottish football great Denis Law, and a couple of popular chocolate brands.\"In terms of dating some of the material, we have been quite lucky,\" says Kieran Manchip, a project officer with Archaeology Scotland. \"We were able to find sweetie wrappers that had best before dates on them. So we have a six pack of Penguin biscuits  and on the rear side it says 14 March 1983, and we found a lovely Twix wrapper at the bottom of the rubble. \"It says 21 May 1983, so we know the site was backfilled by May 1983.\"We found a hologram sticker or poster of Denis Law wearing a Man Utd shirt, which can be dated to the early 70s (Law left Manchester United in 1973).\"The processes are the same with archaeology – you can apply them to any time in the human past.\"Part of the original skatepark was unearthed during the digDr Brophy hopes the work on the skatepark site will help ensure it is remembered by future generations. In Jamie Blair's case, the excavation brought the past flooding back.\"I remember the laughs you had, your friends, your teammates. We were just crazy for skateboarding.\"",

HM Coastguard initially responded to reports of a \"number of people in difficulty in the water\" at the seaside town.Police did not provide the gender or age of the second body they recovered, and said the circumstances were not suspicious. Kevin Shoesmith/BBCGeorge Gouldson says he saw three people in the water George Gouldson, 73, was taking photographs of the stormy seas from his car when the incident began.He said he saw people \"running towards the towers\", a local landmark on the promenade.\"I saw three people in the water before others got in. One of the people in the water was a female.\"A bloke was trying to throw a life ring to her, but it wouldn't reach her. The tide just took her. She was swept away, along the length of the beach, towards the rocks. The water was that fierce. \"A load of people were trying to get to her. One bloke got out of the water. I picked him up and sat him against a wall. He looked to be hypothermic.\" BBC/Jessica LaneConditions at the scene have been described as \"horrendous\" as snow and ice warnings apply across much of the UKMr Gouldson, who returned to the scene with his dog on Saturday morning, said he did not see the woman or the two other people emerge from the water.\"It's something you see on television, not in Withernsea,\" he added.\"My mind just won't settle. It's just so sad.\"Janice Holgate, 60, drove 17 miles (27km) from her home in Hull to lay flowers at the scene.She said: \"It breaks my heart what has happened. It's an awful start to the year. I just wanted to do something.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJanice Holgate lays flowers close to the scene of the tragedyWithernsea Methodist Church opened its doors for prayers on Saturday morning.The Reverend Ian Greenfield said he had received messages from all over the country offering support.\"When we realized the severity of it and the tragedy of it, we felt it was really important that we had our church open this morning for people to come along.\"For people to be able to come and pray and to receive emotional support,\" he said.BBC/Jessica LaneMembers of the coastguard resumed searches at first light on SaturdayThe incident was first reported at 15:10 on Friday, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.  The search was paused at about 00:30 on Saturday and resumed at first light.A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said teams from Hull, Withernsea, Hornsea and Bridlington were sent to the scene at 06:30 to continue the search.At Withernsea, snow began to fall just after first light and those searching have been battling bitterly cold and windy conditions along with driving snow.Snow and ice warnings are covering much of the UK over the weekend and beyond and a yellow warning is in place for the east coast of England until 23:49 on Saturday.BBC/Amanda WhiteReverend Ian Greenfield says the community has received messages of support from across the UKA police spokesperson said: \"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues.\"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely.\"Hornsea Inshore Rescue said on Friday it had faced \"horrendous conditions\" and there had been 9.8ft (3m) waves.The operation has involved about 100 members of the emergency services, including Yorkshire Ambulance and Humberside Fire and Rescue.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesRelated internet links",

    "body": "40 minutes agoLeigh BoobyerWest of EnglandA convicted murderer is one of two inmates on the run from police after absconding from prison on New Year's Day.Matthew Armstrong, who was convicted in the late-2000s of a murder which happened during a robbery in Warwickshire, left HMP Leyhill in South Gloucestershire along with Daniel Washbourne who has previous convictions for violence.Avon and Somerset Police said they are believed to have left the open prison at a time between 17:00 and 20:00 GMT on 1 January.The force said they are not from the local area, and have links to various parts of the country. Members of the public are urged to call 999 immediately if they see them.A third man who is suspected of absconding at the same time was arrested in Bristol on Saturday.Open prisons have \"minimal security and allow eligible prisoners to spend most of their day away from the prison on licence to carry out work, education or for other resettlement purposes\", according to the Ministry of Justice.HMP Leyhill has an operational capacity of about 825 inmates.Police have released CCTV footage showing what the men were wearing on New Year's Day.Armstrong, 35, was last seen wearing a burgundy or orange coat, grey cap, grey tracksuit suit bottoms with blue on the side, and black boots.He is described as white, male, about 5ft 9ins, with ginger hair and scars on his forehead.Police said he has known links to Warwickshire.Washbourne, 40, is described as white, male, about 5ft 6ins, slim, with brown hair and clean shaven.He was last seen wearing a cream coloured fleece, blue tracksuit bottoms, blue hat and black trainers. He has known links to Herefordshire.Police said officers understand he has previous convictions for violence against a person offences and false imprisonment.HMP Leyhill reported the absconders to the force on Thursday evening, and police attended the prison at about 21:45 GMT to start carrying out enquiries.\"Urgent actions\" have been completed, police said, \"including circulating the men as wanted via national police systems\". Intelligence work to trace the men's movements is ongoing and other police forces have checked linked addresses but not found them.A Prison Service spokesperson said: \"Absconding is a serious criminal offence, and any prisoner who commits this crime could face longer behind bars.\"The police are working urgently to recapture these individuals, and we urge anyone with information to go to the police.\"",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.Meanwhile, an Iranian police spokesman said officers would not allow what he called \"enemies\" to turn \"unrest into chaos\".Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while and another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi-Azad warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".This stance was echoed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said it was \"completely fair\" that shopkeepers protest the economic situation, but that any \"rioters must be put in their place\".Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani called on the UN Security Council to condemn Trump's statement in letter to the secretary-general and president of the Security Council on Friday, news agency Reuters reported. \"Iran will exercise its rights decisively and proportionately. The United States of America bears full responsibility for any consequences arising from these unlawful threats and any ensuing escalation,\" he wrote in the letter.",

    "body": "7 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and west reporterGetty ImagesThe Bearsden shark was discovered near Glasgow in 1982Think of sharks and the most common images that spring to mind will likely be of dangerous predators hunting prey, accompanied by ominous music.  However, a town in the leafy suburbs of Glasgow has its own connection to the famous fish - and it dates back millions of years.In 1982 a complete shark fossil was discovered in Bearsden, in East Dunbartonshire. It was so complete experts could even see the remains of the last meal eaten by the fish, 330 million years after it died.Now a group of local enthusiasts are hoping to install a sculpture of the fish in the town, ensuring the tale of the Bearsden Shark will be remembered for future generations.     The one metre long shark - officially named as the Akmonistion zangerli - was discovered at the Manse Burn in Bearsden, among dozens of other fish and plant samples found during an excavation of the site.According to local legend, some boys in the area had discovered fossils and brought them to the attention of Bearsden fossil hunter Stan Wood, at that time working at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow.He arranged for the excavation to take place throughout the summer of 1982, with the Bearsden shark the most exciting find.\"It's the most complete fossil shark of any kind, anywhere, of any age,\" says Dr Neil Clark, the curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian.  \"It's totally preserved, so every vertebrae and every tooth is in the place it was when it was alive. It's a very useful fossil for understanding what these sharks are like, as before we usually worked with just pieces of teeth or the head.\"For something like the megalodon (usually portrayed in various action and horror films as gigantic) we have no idea how big it really was because we just have the teeth to go on.\"These sharks became extinct during the Triassic period when around 96 per cent of creatures died out – that was far more than during the Cretaceous period which marked the end of the dinosaurs. \" Hunterian MuseumThe fossil is on display at the Hunterian MuseumGiven this was hundreds of millions of years ago, Scotland bore no resemblance to the land it is today, instead being located near the equator.\"What is now Bearsden was part of a lagoon,\" explains Neil Buchanan, an enthusiast on the shark.  \"That lent to the type of fish that were there, shrimps and the like. Then there was some sort of catastrophic event for the shark, which killed it, but it seemed to sink into mud.\"Yet while soft tissue usually rots away, the lack of oxygen caused by the manner of the shark's death and more mud landing on top preserved the fish.A plaque on a small cairn already marks where the discovery was made, but Mr Buchanan and others in the Bearsden Shark Group would now like to see a sculpture in the town as a memento of the shark.\"People are beginning to forget about it, \" he says. \"You mention the Bearsden shark to people and sometimes they have no idea about it.  \"One of the things we have come to realise is that the site itself is isolated from the population, so we came up with the idea of a permanent display in the town centre.\"The quality would hopefully be attractive enough for people locally to look at, and maybe even have visitors come.\"Dr Neil Clark says there are still mysteries to be solved regarding the sharkDespite the shark being so well preserved, Dr Clark says there remain many mysteries about the fish found in a Bearsden burn.\"There is still a lot to be found out about them, especially the structure behind the head,\" he explains. \"There are a lot of different theories. At the time it was found they thought maybe it arched its back and make it look like a huge mouth, but it's so narrow it wouldn't actually look like a mouth, so that theory is out the window. \"Another theory has it as a male shark and perhaps it was a purpose in mating, like for scratching females. \"There is still so much more to be found about these creatures, but we may never discover it. \"Research is still ongoing regarding the things dug out of Bearsden and there's always something new coming out from them - that's what is so magical about it.\"",

    "body": "Two suspects have been arrested over the theft of precious crown jewels from Paris's Louvre museum, French media say.The Paris prosecutor's office said one of the men had been taken into custody as he was preparing to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum last Sunday, when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight.France's justice minister has conceded security protocols \"failed\", leaving the country with a \"terrible image\".The Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrests had been made on Saturday evening, without specifying how many people had been taken into custody.One of the suspects was preparing to travel to Algeria, police sources have told French media, while it's understood the other was going to Mali.Specialist police can question them for up to 96 hours.The Paris prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.The thieves reportedly arrived at 09:30 (06:30 GMT), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.The suspects arrived with a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed the ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves entered by cutting through the window with power tools.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and cut through the glass of two display cases containing jewels.A preliminary report has revealed that one in three rooms in the area of the museum raided had no CCTV cameras, according to French media.French police say the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38.The museum's director told French senators this week that the only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo.CCTV around the perimeter was also weak and \"ageing\", Laurence des Cars said, meaning that staff failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft.Experts have also expressed concern that the jewels may have already been broken up into hundreds of pieces.Gold and silver can be melted down and the gems can be cut up into smaller stones that will be virtually impossible to track back to the robbery, Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC. Security measures have since been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "June Lockhart, best known for her roles in TV shows Lassie and Lost in Space, has died aged 100. The veteran actress died of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica on Thursday, a family spokesman told US media.Lockhart first shot to prominence on Broadway in the 1940s, picking up a newcomer Tony Award for her role in For Love or Money, before transitioning into film and TV. The daughter of famed character actors Kathleen and Gene Lockhart, her standout performance was as mother Ruth Martin in the TV series Lassie, for which she received an Emmy nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role in a drama series.Born in New York City on 25 June 1925, Lockhart made her screen debut aged 13 in the 1938 film A Christmas Carol alongside her parents.She then took up a number of supporting roles through the 1940s, before being the top-billed star of the film She-Wolf of LondonOn Broadway, her performance in For Love or Money was described by the New York Times at the time as \"enchanting\".Her performance saw her receive a Tony Award, a Donaldson Award, a Theatre World Award and the Associated Press citation for Woman of the Year for Drama.From the late 1950s into the 1960s, her time was occupied by starring in 200 episodes of Lassie, after which she had guest appearances on The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and Magnum P.I.Many remember her for her role in the science-fiction serial Lost in Space, in which she played the warm mother of space explorers from 1965 until 1968.In 2021, Lockhart made a cameo in a Netflix remake, providing the voice of Alpha Control.\"She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\" spokesman and friend of 40 years Lyle Gregory told US media.\"It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\"She is survived by her two daughters including Anne Lockhart, who is also an actress.",

    "body": "13 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsWatch: Dr Xand and Dr Chris on working with their 'annoying' twinA giant mug of instant black coffee and no food is not what you'd expect the host of a wellness podcast to have for breakfast.Yet it's what Dr Chris van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs alongside identical twin brother Dr Xand confesses to having.\"I'm approaching middle age so don't want to eat all day. My way of not eating all day is not eating breakfast,\" he says. It's this kind of honesty about not leading the perfect life and struggling with the stuff they know they should do but still don't, that makes them so relatable.The brothers are both medical doctors who've become household names through their TV and radio work - they present children's series Operation Ouch! and Dr Xand is one of BBC's Morning Live resident experts while Dr Chris is well known for his bestselling book Ultra-Processed People. On the podcast, they often disagree with each other over competing claims about health and wellbeing, much like they do in real life. Xand laughs after Chris says it's a hard job working \"with a brother like Xand who is so intensely annoying\".But really the brothers love working together and Chris admits that they started the podcast \"quite selfishly as we were just trying to answer our own questions\". \"But it turns out our problems are similar to everyone else's.\"They say the podcast has changed their lives for the better and share what they have changed about their behaviour over the course of more than 30 episodes.1. Don't obsess over eight hours sleep Getty ImagesLike most of us, the brothers assumed eight hours was the gold standard for sleep and anything less was a failure. Now, they're far less dogmatic. The brothers say a healthy range of sleep can be anywhere between six and 10 hours.\"There's so much anxiety around getting eight hours but some of the most important things in my life, like raising kids, I've done sleep deprived,\" says Chris.Realising that everything from winning wars to completing exams were often done with very little sleep, made them understand that sleep deprivation can sharpen your focus in the short term.Xand says this helped him \"shed all that anxiety\" around optimal sleeping patterns and times.\"It no longer dominates my life and I think about it a lot less.\" He also feels a lot more comfortable taking naps when needed and says he will sometimes \"have a 20 minute sleep if I'm exhausted\". Am I getting enough sleep?2. Pause before saying yes or noGetty ImagesThe pair both find saying \"no\" difficult and Xand says it can feel \"almost physically painful.\" They have now learnt the \"power of the pause\". If something does not require an immediate decision, they now ask for more time to think about it so they don't feel pressured into saying yes.Chris says this has helped him have difficult conversations he may otherwise have put off. However, he admits he's still figuring out how to be more forceful. \"I know I should do, but somehow I'm not and I know I need to focus on that.\" The podcast episode on this topic also taught them that they needed to work out what their values are and then weigh up whether requests fitted in with those. For Xand, his priority was spending more time with his wife and two sons. He has since managed to say no to a number of things that he would have otherwise gone along with for an easy life. \"I recently said no to a very big and important work thing even though there was a lot of pressure on me to do it, but it didn't fit with my other commitments and what I wanted to do.\"Should you say 'no' more often?3. Brush your teeth mindfullyHow to brush your teethOne of the most practical tips that has stuck with the brothers is how they brush their teeth. The small act has become a mindful task and Xand explains he's totally changed the way he brushes.\"My wife, Dolly, hasn't complained about my bad breath since the episode.\"I use brushes for flossing, hold my toothbrush at a different angle and I don't look at my phone while brushing.\" While Chris is shocked that his brother ever used his phone while brushing his teeth, he agrees with how powerful the changes have been. \"It's about the angle of the brush, being more gentle and having a better picture of what you're trying to achieve - you want to clean every surface of every tooth.\"How can I freshen my breath?4. Willpower doesn't existGetty ImagesMany people believe that struggling with diet, exercise or breaking habits is down to personal weakness, and Xand shares those feelings. \"I feel lazy and inadequate most of the time.\"I go to Manchester every week and I usually arrive late after a long train journey and I order a takeaway and do no exercise then I beat myself up about it.\" Their expert guest on this podcast episode, psychologist Kimberley Wilson, helped Xand understand that \"there's no such thing as willpower\".Willpower is not this magic thing inside you, instead your ability to stick to something is \"about the way you've arranged the world around you,\" he says.For example, by planning ahead and thinking about what you'll have for dinner, you can more easily ditch the takeaway and eat something healthy. Since the episode, Xand has managed to increase how much exercise he is doing, but still doesn't enjoy it. \"I just get on the exercise bike and have those negative thoughts while I do my workout,\" he says. Another simple change he's made is taking a bag of apples with him on his regular commute between London and Manchester, rather than buying unhealthy snacks on the train.Chris realised willpower wasn't about increasing your tolerance to distress and suffering, but simply being more organised.\"I've started batch-cooking which now releases time for me to do things like read with my daughter.\" How important is willpower?For all the changes they've embraced, the brothers are the first to admit they don't follow every bit of expert advice.Take sunscreen, for example. \"A dermatologist gave us really good advice,\" Dr Chris says, \"but there's something about the sun that feels so powerful. Academically, we know sun exposure is bad and causes cancer but we still find ourselves drawn to it.\" That tension - between what we know and what we do - is at the heart of their podcast. If there's one thing the doctors hope listeners take away from the show, it's that struggling with health isn't a personal failure.\"So much of your health and well-being isn't your fault,\" says Dr Xand. \"There are loads of forces trying to take your money, attention and time away from the things that matter. What we're trying to do is sweep that out of the way, help you identify your values and align your life with them.\"Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "How the nation lost its appetite for Pizza Hut 13 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterBBCPizza Hut was once a go-to for families and friends to tuck into its all-you-can eat buffet, unlimited salad bar, and self-serve ice-cream with all the toppings.But fewer diners are \"hitting the Hut\" these days and it is closing half its UK restaurants after being bought out of administration for the second time this year.\"We used to go to Pizza Hut when I was a child,\" says Prudence, when the BBC asked shoppers in London why they thought the chain was struggling. \"It was like a family thing, you'd go on a Sunday - make a day of it.\" But now aged 24 she says \"it's not a thing anymore\".For 23-year-old Martina Debnatch it is some of the very things Pizza Hut has been known and loved for since it opened in the UK in the 1970s that are now not-so-hot.\"The way they do their buffet and their salad bar, it feels like they are cheapening on their quality and have lower standards...They're giving away so much food and you're like 'How?'\"'It feels like they are cheapening on their quality and have lower standards,' says 23-year-old Martina DebnatchAs food prices have soared, Pizza Hut's all-you-can-eat model has become very expensive to run. As have its 132 restaurants which are being sliced to 64.The business, like many others, has also seen its costs increase. In April this year, staffing costs jumped due to rises in minimum wages (which went up nearly 7% this year, to £12.21 for employees aged 21 and over) as well as an increase in employer national insurance contributions.Chris, 36, and Joanne, 29 say they used to go to Pizza Hut for a date \"every now and then\", but now they order in a Domino's and think Pizza Hut is \"very overpriced\".Depending on your order, Pizza Hut and Domino's prices are similar, says Giulia Crouch, food expert and author of The Happiest Diet in the World.While Pizza Hut does offer takeaway and deliveries through Ubers Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat, it is losing out to big rivals which solely cater to this market.\"Domino's has managed to dominate the takeaway pizza sector thanks to aggressive marketing and constantly running deals that make consumers feel like they're getting a bargain, when in reality the original prices are quite high,\" says Ms Crouch.But for Chris and Joanne it is worth it to get their date night delivered to their door.\"We definitely eat at home now more than we eat out,\" says Joanne, echoing recent statistics that show a drop in people going to casual and fast-food restaurants. John Keeble/Getty ImagesCasual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers over the summer Over the summer, casual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers compared to last summer.There is also another rival to restaurant and takeaway pizzas: the cook-at-home oven pizza.Will Hawkley, head of leisure and hospitality at KPMG, points out that not only have supermarkets been offering high-quality oven-ready pizzas for years - some are even selling home-pizza ovens.\"Lifestyle changes are also playing a factor in the success of fast-food chains,\" says Mr Hawkley.The rising popularity of high protein diets has boosted sales at chicken shops, while hitting sales of carb-heavy pizza, he adds.As people go out to eat less frequently they may look for a more a premium experience and Pizza Hut's American-diner style with booth seating can feel more retro than upmarket.The \"explosion of high-quality pizzerias\" over the last 10 to 15 years, such as Franco Manca, has \"fundamentally changed the public's perception of what good pizza is,\" says Ms Crouch.\"A light, fresh, easy-to-digest product with a few choice toppings, not the massively greasy, heavy and overloaded pizzas of the past. That, I think, is what's caused Pizza Hut's downfall,\" she says.\"Why would anyone spend £17.99 on a small, substandard, disappointing pizza from a chain when you can get a beautiful, masterfully-made Margherita for under a tenner at one of the many authentic Italian pizzerias around the country? \"It's a no-brainer.\"Dan Puddle, who owns Smokey Deez, a small mobile pizza van based in Suffolk says: \"It's not that people have fallen out of love with pizza - they just want better pizza for their money.\"Dan says his flexible operation can offer premium pizza at accessible prices, and that Pizza Hut struggled because it could not keep up with new customer habits.At Pizzarova, a small independent chain based in Bristol, owner Jack Lander says the pizza market is broadening but Pizza Hut has failed to offer anything new.\"You now have slice concepts, London pizza, new haven, sourdough, Neapolitan, Detroit - it's a heavenly minefield for a pizza-loving consumer to explore.\"Jack says Pizza Hut \"needs to reinvent itself\" as younger people don't have any sense of nostalgia or loyalty to the brand.Jack LanderJack Lander owns an independent pizza chain in BristolOver time, Pizza Hut's market has been sliced up and distributed to its trendier, more nimble rivals. To maintain its expensive staffing and restaurants, it would have to increase costs - which KPMG's Mr Hawkley says is difficult at a time when household budgets are shrinking.Nicolas Burquier, Pizza Hut's managing director of international markets, said the buyout aimed \"to safeguard our guest experience and protect jobs where possible\". He said its immediate priority was to continue operating at the remaining 64 restaurants and 343 delivery sites and to support colleagues through the transition.But with so much money going in to running its restaurants, it likely can't afford to invest too much in its delivery service because the sector is \"complex and partnering with existing delivery apps comes at a cost\", Mr Hawkley says .But, he adds, cutting its costs by leaving oversaturated towns and city centres could be a good way to adapt.More weekend picks",

Axel says this really brings a look to life.Prosthetics for beginnersAdding prosthetics to a more basic makeup look can really up the fear-factor.  Axel suggests starting off with things that are very easy to buy.“ and cotton wool can go a long way.”They suggest applying a layer of the latex, adding some cotton wool which should stick to it but still be mouldable, then add colour with makeup: “You can make scars from that, gashes or boils. You can really do a lot.”From fake blood to fashionSince appearing on Glow Up, Axel has been busy on a variety of big projects including a gory horror film. As the lead makeup artist they designed a rig of tubes, hidden under prosthetic skin, so when characters were \"attacked\", fake blood could spurt out of their fake wounds.Axel has also been working on makeup for the catwalk show of fashion designer, Jean Louie Castillo. This also has the spook factor Axel says. \"He [Jean Louie] loves to have special effects makeup creating ghouls that walk the runway. It's very gothic, very edgy, and right up my street.”Whether you're welcoming trick or treaters on your street, or off out to a ghoulish party, BBC Bitesize hopes you find the perfect inspiration to get your spook on this Halloween.All episodes of Series 1 to 7 of Glow Up are available on BBC iPlayerThis article was published in October 2025",

    "body": "'I sold cakes as a kid, then I got a Michelin star'5 days agoAida FofanaWest Midlands Paul FosterPaul Foster, pictured in the middle, said he always wanted to open a resturantA chef who went from being a kid baking cupcakes for doormen in pubs to running his own Michelin-starred restaurant is taking his love of cuisine to the internet.Paul Foster's culinary journey began in the comfort of Coventry pub kitchens run by his mum, where as a 10-year-old he would help to feed punters and bake.He went on to open SALT in Stratford-upon-Avon before taking the decision to close the restaurant after eight years of serving internationally-inspired fine dining amid cost-of-living pressures on customers, he said.He has since launched YouTube channel Food Unfiltered, exploring what goes on inside the kitchens of some of the world's best restaurants. He said owning his own restaurant was always the dream and it was a lifetime goal to achieve a Michelin star.And while he did contemplate signing up for another lease for SALT, he said he had decided it was time to move into food media.\"It was really sad,\" he said of the decision to close. \"Anyone in the industry knows people aren't eating out as much anymore. \"There's a squeeze of cost of living, and fine dining restaurants is a luxury.\"I've had an incredible eight years, I've achieved everything I wanted out of my career, and it was a pinnacle.\"He added: \"I always remembered that I didn't get into cooking for Michelin. I got into it for the love of food and the love of pleasing people.\"Listen on BBC Sounds: From pub kitchen to Michelin chefMr Foster said: \"My dream was always to have my own small restaurant. Having  worked in Michelin star restaurants all over the world, that was what I wanted to do; I wanted to bring something like that as close as possible to Coventry.\"He said the city - and its pubs - had been the stomping ground for a love of food to grow.\"One of [the pubs] was a live music venue. It was great [although] I couldn't sleep much because of the noise coming through but I was just obsessed with the environment of the kitchen, the atmosphere, heat and swear words,\" he said.As a 13-year-old, he tried recipes from the Gary Rhodes book Rhodes Around Britain and saw \"the pleasure on people's faces\", which turned his hobby into a passion.\"I thought 'that was worth two hours in the kitchen, just to see how much that pleased someone',\" he said.\"I knew there was something in it and I took it from there.\"More on this story",

    "description": "Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement ",
    "body": "Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.The US president called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship in a social media post on Saturday.Ontario's premier said he would take it down to allow trade talks with the US to proceed, after Trump withdrew - but that it would still run in the US over the weekend.Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said of the tariff increase: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration.\"Trump's decision comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney.But he said it would still appear during games for the World Series, including between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip. Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoReutersDonald Trump arrives in Kuala Lumpur as he kicks off a tour of Asia.US President Donald Trump has arrived in Asia for a whirlwind week of diplomacy, which includes a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.Top of the agenda will be trade – an area where tensions between the world's two biggest economies have once again been ramping up.Trump landed in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, as a summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, begins on Sunday. He will then visit Japan and finally South Korea, where the White House says he will meet Xi.  So what are the wins Trump and other leaders are hoping for, and what are the pitfalls? Our correspondents explain what you should know about the week ahead.For Trump, China is the key By Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondentInking new trade deals that provide opportunities to American businesses while keeping the tariff revenue flowing into the US Treasury is sure to be a central focus of Trump's Asia trip.While there are multiple players in the global trade dance, the key to Trump's success or failure is China. And Trump's scheduled meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec – the first since 2019 – could set the course for US-China relations for the rest of Trump's second term in office.As the US president has acknowledged, draconian tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable. And while he has not explicitly said so, an escalating economic war with America's largest trading partner would have devastating consequences – for the US, for China and for the rest of the world.The steep tumbles in the major US stock indexes every time China and the US appear at an impasse underlines this reality.When he heads back to America next week, Trump is sure to be pleased if he is able to finalise a deal with South Korea and secure new Japanese investment in US manufacturing.But his top priority is sure to be convincing Xi to resume purchases of American agricultural exports, loosen recent restrictions on foreign access to Chinese rare earth materials, give US companies greater access to the Chinese market and avoid a full-blown trade war.For Trump, as the saying goes, that's the whole ballgame.Xi's long gameBy Laura Bicker, China correspondentWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping meets Trump on 30 October in South Korea, he wants to be the tougher negotiator.That is why he has been leveraging China's stranglehold on rare earths, the minerals without which you cannot make semiconductors, weapons systems, cars or even smartphones. It's a US weakness, and China is exploiting it – just like it is hurting American farmers, and Trump's rural vote base, by not buying their soybeans.Xi has also learned lessons from Trump 1.0 and this time, Beijing, it appears, is willing to embrace the pain of tariffs. For one, the US, which once took in a fifth of Chinese exports, is no longer such a crucial market.Getty ImagesTrump's tariffs on imports to the US will be at the top of the agenda in every meeting this week Still Xi has a balance to strike, between an economic battle with the US, and his struggle with domestic challenges. And Washington knows about Xi's troubles: high youth unemployment, a real estate crisis, mounting local government debt and a population unwilling to spend.Analysts believe China may offer to do a deal if Trump agrees to start exporting advanced AI chips or pull back on more military support for Taiwan.But getting there won't be easy. One big difference is that it often seems like Trump is willing to roll a dice and gamble – but Xi is playing a much longer game.So the question may be: can Trump wait it out?A starring role in 'peace'By Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondentThe US president appears interested in one thing only during his visit to Malaysia: playing the starring role in a ceremony arranged specially for him, at which Thailand and Cambodia signed some kind of peace accord.Differences between the two countries over their border remain unresolved, but, under pressure to come up with something, they have made progress in agreeing to demilitarise the border.Neither can afford to disappoint President Trump. Back in July, when they were still bombing and shelling each other, his threat to end tariff talks forced them into an immediate ceasefire.Other Asean member states will hope for Trump's mere presence, brief though it is, to normalise relations with the US. They have had a tumultuous year in which their export-dependent economies were badly shaken by his tariff war. Exports from the region to the US have doubled since Trump's last visit to the Asean summit in 2017.Once Trump leaves, the other leaders can settle down to normal business – the quiet, incremental diplomacy which advances the plodding progress of integration among them.Also on the agenda is a conflict that doesn't have Trump's attention - the civil war in Myanmar, which has haunted every Asean gathering since it was triggered by a brutal coup in 2021.Ink on paper, please By Suranjana Tewari, Asia business correspondent Asia's manufacturing powerhouses, which make up much of the world's output, will be looking for respite from Trump's tariffs.Some have agreed deals, while others are still stuck in talks – but none have signed an agreement.So ink on paper, or at least promising talks, would be welcome.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump and Xi during the latter's visit to the US in 2017Take China. The meeting between Trump and Xi signals progress, but the two leaders have a lot to unpick, from levies and export controls, to the source of it all: rivalry between the world's two biggest economies as they compete for an edge in AI and advanced tech.Any ease in those tensions would bring relief to other countries in the region who have been caught in the middle. South East Asia may be the most trapped – it is deeply woven into US supply chains in electronics, for example, yet heavily reliant on Chinese demand.Exports to the US have doubled over the past decade, but tariffs of 10% to 40% would pummel manufacturers in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. It could also hurt US chipmakers like Micron Technology, which operates plants in Malaysia. The country exported around $10bn worth of semiconductors to the US last year, roughly a fifth of total US chip imports.Wealthy economies like Japan and South Korea face a different dilemma. Although close allies of the US, they are in for an unpredictable time – and will want to lock in tariff terms and investments. Automakers in both countries, which see the US as a key market, are already struggling to navigate the chaos.An early test for Japan's new PM By Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondent Trump has described Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, as a woman with great \"strength and wisdom\".This week, her ability to forge a stable, working relationship with him will be an early test of her leadership - and of Japan's place in a shifting world order.In her first speech in parliament, she pledged to raise Japan's defence budget, signalling her intent to shoulder more of the security burden with Washington. Trump has spoken of this before and is expected to press Tokyo to contribute more to US troop deployments - Japan hosts the largest number of American forces abroad, about 53,000 personnel.AFP via Getty ImagesJapan's new PM Sanae TakaichiBoth sides also want to finalise a tariff deal negotiated by her predecessor. Particularly beneficial to Japan's auto giants - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - it cuts US import duties on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, potentially making them more competitive against Chinese rivals.By retaining Ryosei Akazawa as chief tariff negotiator, Takaichi is betting on continuity.In return, Japan has pledged to invest $550bn in the US to strengthen supply chains in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Trump has also said Japan will increase purchases of US farm products, including rice, a move welcomed in Washington but unsettling for Japanese farmers.Takaichi's ties to the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who shared a close rapport with Trump, could also work in her favour. Abe famously used rounds of golf at Mar-a-Lago to earn Trump's trust – it's the kind of personal diplomacy Takaichi may seek to emulate.Talking tariffs as Kim Jong Un loomsBy Jake Kwon, Seoul correspondent For South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the pressing issue is Trump's tariffs.But that thunder was briefly stolen by rampant speculation that Trump might visit the border to see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Back in August, Lee dedicated most of his time in the Oval Office to flatter Trump as a \"peacemaker\". Trump responded with enthusiasm to the prospect of sitting down with Kim, who he hasn't seen since 2019. Kim said last month that he still remembers Trump \"fondly\".Analysts believe Kim is hoping to legitimise his nuclear weapons programme with another summit with the US president. There is no indication that a meeting is in the works. Either way, Lee has a trade deal to negotiate. Talks to lower US duties on South Korean exports from 25% to 15% have stalled, despite multiple trips by Seoul officials to Washington. The sticking point is Trump's insistence that Seoul invest $350bn upfront in the US – roughly a fifth of South Korea's economy, such a huge investment could create a financial crisis, Seoul fears.But in recent days, Korean officials have voiced hope, speaking of tangible progress. And they will be hoping for a signed deal by the end of Wednesday's summit between Trump and Lee.",

    "body": "I lost thousands of photos when my phone crashed. Now I print them out for my daughter13 hours agoGeorge SandemanStephen BuffardiStephen Buffardi, with wife Weena and daughter Sophia, lost thousands of family photosAs Stephen Buffardi was transferring photos to his new phone, the progress bar reached halfway - then it crashed.Thousands of pictures with friends and family, including early dates with his now wife, were lost forever.\"It was annoying,\" says the 36-year-old, who lives in Massachusetts. He and his wife Weena, 32, now have a six-year-old daughter, Sophia.\"When you have a kid you're like, it would have been nice to have those photos now - to save them for her.\"Sophia will never be able to see the pictures of her parents when they first met.For Stephen, this was a moment of realisation that digital photos don't always stand the test of time. So he decided to start making physical albums for her.Stephen BuffardiLosing so many photos has spurred Stephen into creating physical albums for SophiaHe's documented her life as a newborn - featuring her hospital tag and ink prints of her tiny feet - as well as one for each year of her childhood so far.And he's currently putting together an album which will show her life as a five-year-old. Earlier this week he ordered 300 photographs to be printed.This is nothing new - people have been compiling photo albums and scrapbooks for more than 100 years. But what should you think about if you want to keep your photos safe?Experts broadly agree you should keep three versions of your most treasured pictures: the original on your phone, one copy online, and one on a hard drive.Some even suggest going one step further - printing them out.Stephen BuffardiSophia enjoys going through the albums Stephen has made to document her childhoodIn a digital world, preserving information is everyone's problem.Last week the UK government told businesses they should have contingency plans on paper in case of cyber-attacks. And just days ago, a problem with Amazon Web Services disrupted more than 1,000 businesses globally.Christopher Barnatt, a former computing and future studies lecturer and YouTuber, says this is why we should think about making physical copies of all important documents - for example birth certificates, insurance papers and passports.Photos are arguably no different. And there are plenty of tools we can use to protect them.What caused the AWS outage - and why did it make the internet fall apart?Amazon Web Services outage: Are we relying too much on US big tech?One obvious step is to back them up onto an online cloud service like Apple's iCloud or Google Photos. Smartphones often do this automatically.But there are issues like space and cost.iCloud has a limit of 5GB - which covers photos as well as iPhone backups and other app data. After that, iCloud charges UK users £0.99 per month for up to 50GB of space. Google Photos offers 15GB - shared with the user's Gmail and Google Drive content - before charging.While these services are very stable, they are not totally risk-free.Earlier this year, a woman in North Carolina told the WBTV news outlet her iCloud account was hacked and her password changed. She lost access to her photos and videos and said Apple told her there was nothing they could do about it.You don't have to be hacked though. If you're really unlucky you might forget your password and be unable to restore it - meaning you can't log back into your cloud service.It's probably safer to keep your photos on a cloud service than on social media.\"A lot of people use social media almost like a diary. Social media platforms are set up to sort of serialise people's lives and [create] narratives,\" says Dr Esperanza Miyake of the University of Strathclyde, who researches how social media companies treat people's data.In 2019, a server migration by MySpace - which was once the most popular social media platform in the world - resulted in the loss of 12 years' worth of music uploads. They were \"all gone\", says Dr Miyake. The company apologised for the data loss.There can be a cost issue, too. Earlier this month Snapchat announced it would start charging people for storing photos and videos on their messaging app, much to the annoyance of some users.Snapchat said 5GB of storage would remain free, but after that users would be charged $1.99 (£1.48) per month for up to 100GB of space.Prof Jane Winters, a digital humanities specialist from the University of London, suggests there will always be a problem with treating commercial platforms as archives. \"They don't have an archival function. They're commercial entities.\"The assumption that we will always be able to keep uploading every single photo we take and have it preserved in perpetuity by a commercial entity is one that's going to be tested.\"This is why downloading photos and keeping them on an external device like a hard drive or memory card is a good idea.You shouldn't have to worry about images becoming unreadable for a very long time - thanks to \"robust\" image file formats like jpeg, according to Prof Winters.Many hard drives work for up to 10 years - with some lasting for 20 - so it's important to move your pictures to new hard drives as the decades pass.Thendo MuloiwaThendo Muloiwa thinks there is a particular joy in sharing physical photo albumsIf you've got your three copies of your photos, you're in a good place. But what about printing them out?Despite the risks of fire, water damage, or simply being misplaced, it's still a genuinely durable way of passing down memories through the generations.Dr Barnatt and Dr Miyake say people who grew up with social media and mobile phones should keep offline copies of their most beloved items.\"It's about valuing what's important to you before it's too late,\" says Prof Winters.If you start thinking about printing out your digital archive too late in life, \"you may have lost the things you value already\".South African Thendo Muloiwa has decided to do just that, at the age of 28.He loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a young child and wants to do the same with the digital pictures he has snapped using his phone. They show the places he has been, and the friends he has made during his 20s.Thendo MuloiwaThendo loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a childSome archivists and futurists see this return to print as a way to counter a \"digital dark age\" - the idea that photos, videos and text might become unreadable as technology changes.But Prof Winters thinks those claims are overblown, pointing to major international efforts to preserve more and more digital and online internet.For many people, printing photos is more than just about documenting history.Thendo says there is a particular joy people share when looking through a photo album together and chatting.\"You can't really do that on your phone,\" Thendo says. \"Sure, you can open up your iCloud or whatever and scroll through all your photos, but you're going to find a lot of random pictures.\"As opposed to a photo album where you would have the perfect picture that you have picked and put in there - that's the difference.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergWatch: Kamala Harris expresses concern that she didn’t ask Joe Biden to pull out of presidential raceFormer US Vice-President Kamala Harris has expressed concern that she did not ask Joe Biden to pull out of the race for the White House.In an interview with the BBC for Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said: \"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run for re-election.\"After months of speculation about his health and mental acuity, President Biden ended his re-election bid in July 2024 after a disastrous performance in a debate against Donald Trump a few weeks earlier.Harris, who stepped in as the Democratic nominee but lost to Trump, has revealed in her book about her three-month campaign that she did not discuss with President Biden her concerns over his ability. Nor did the then 81-year-old raise the issue with her.In the book, 107 Days, the former vice-president wrote that Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\". She wrote that \"perhaps\" she should have raised it with him.In this interview she told the BBC that she still ponders whether she should have acted differently and talked to him about it.\"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run.\" She said \"my concern, especially on reflection is, should I have actually raised it\". She questioned whether it was \"grace or recklessness\" that stopped her speaking up.'I am not done': Harris tells BBC she may run for president againHer worry, she added, was not Biden's capacity to do the job of commander in chief but about whether he would meet the demands of a gruelling election campaign to stay in the White House.When pressed on why there is a distinction, she said there was a serious difference between running for the office and conducting the duties of being president. And running against Trump is even more demanding, she said.She said she had a \"concern about his [Biden's] ability, with the level of endurance, energy, that it requires, especially running against the now current president\".The former vice-president said it was hard for her to speak up because she risked being accused of promoting her own political interests if she had confronted Biden about his health.\"Part of the issue there was that it would – would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation, given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest?\"The issue of whether more people in Biden's circle could have challenged him about the wisdom of him running again has become a major talking point.Five takeaways from BBC's Joe Biden interviewBiden aide hits back at alleged cover-up of his deteriorationOne book, Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleged that people close to him covered up his physical deterioration from the public.Biden's aides have pushed back at the allegation, saying there were physical changes as he got older but no evidence of mental incapacity and nothing that affected his ability to do the job.In his first interview after leaving the White House, in May of this year, Biden told the BBC it would not have mattered if he had left the race any earlier.His former vice-president is in the UK promoting her new book. In a wide-ranging conversation for the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Harris also said it was \"possible\" she could run for the White House again.She has already ruled out running for governor in her home state, California, and the former prosecutor told the BBC she was \"not done\" with public service.",

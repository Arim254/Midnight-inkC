    "body": "29 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterPAPoliticians have given away too much power to lawyers, activists and regulators, and cannot deliver their promises, an ex-aide to the prime minister has said.Writing in The Times, Paul Ovenden, who quit as Keir Starmer's director of political strategy last September after offensive messages he had sent in 2017 surfaced, said  the British state had got \"bigger and bigger while simultaneously and systematically emasculating itself\".He also said the case of the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah \"revealed the sheer weirdness of how Whitehall spends its time\". Speaking to the BBC, he said with a \"stiffening resolve\" politicians could \"take back control\" of the levers of democracy. Mr Ovenden told Radio 4's Today programme, that he believed Sir Keir was \"exactly the right person\" to make changes adding: \"He does feel those frustrations very acutely.\"Separately, Chris Powell – who worked on four Labour general elections and the brother of the PM's adviser Jonathan Powell – has said the Labour government needs a \"fundamental reset\" in order to fight off the electoral threat posed by Reform UK.Writing in The Guardian, he said voters were \"fed up, think nothing works – and some are simply angry and feel ignored\".Their comments come at the start of a potentially difficult year for the prime minister which includes local elections in May and the threat of a leadership challenge from those in the Labour Party unhappy with his performance so far.Mr Abd El Fattah was imprisoned in an Egyptian jail for more than a decade after being convicted of \"spreading fake news\" about torture in the country. He was released in September following lobbying by successive British governments and arrived in the UK last week. His arrival was initially welcomed by the prime minister who said he was \"delighted\" and that his case had been \"a top priority for my government\".However, Sir Keir faced criticism when social media posts emerged in which Mr Abd El Fattah called for the killing of Zionists and police officers.Sir Keir said he had been unaware of the \"absolutely abhorrent\" posts, which Mr Abd El Fattah has since apologised for, and that the government was reviewing the \"information failures in this case\". Reflecting on the case, Mr Ovenden told Radio 4's Today programme: \"We'd be having long meetings on the priorities of the government and they would be railroaded by any other business into discussions about this gentleman.\"Most of us on the political side of government weren't that aware of it, weren't that tuned into it because it didn't impact us on a day-to-day basis.\"It actually became a kind of running joke within government that people would always find a way to bring it back to this conversation.\"He said the case \"became sort of totemic of the distraction of issues that it felt like a different part of government were fascinated by\". Asked why politicians could not ignore these subjects, Mr Ovenden said they had \"effectively handed away power\".\"What they're really trying to do is hand away risk but they've handed away power to arm's length bodies, to quangos, to activists, to lawyers, to regulatory framework, to well-networked organisations... who are able to basically stop the machinery of government doing things.\"He said examples of subjects he considered to be distractions included paying colonial reparations or banning vaping in pub gardens.He added that it was \"no surprise the public are fed up with politicians' ability to get things done\" but that he believed that \"we can change this and change quite quickly\". He argued that the government should start by scaling back some of the government's legal obligations such as environmental obligations for building and the right to launch legal challenges against government policies through judicial reviews. His comments echoed a sentiment previously expressed by others in government, including the prime minister. Before Christmas, when asked by the parliamentary Liaison Committee what he had found most difficult in government, Sir Keir replied: \"Speed and ability to get things done in Parliament.\"We have so many checks and balances and consultations and regulations and arm's length bodies.\"My own sense, after 12 to 18 months in the job - and this is a fault of governments of all political colours - is that every time something has gone wrong in the past, successive governments have put in place another procedure, another body or another consultation to try to stop ourselves ever making a mistake again. \"My experience as prime minister is of frustration that every time I go to pull a lever, there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations and arm's length bodies that mean the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be, which is among the reasons I want to cut down on regulation generally and within government.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoPritti Mistry,Business reporterandTheo Leggett,International business correspondentThe FTSE 100 index has climbed above 10,000 points for the first time, passing a significant stock market milestone, on the first trading day of the year.Shares included in the index performed strongly in 2025, leaving the benchmark more than 21% higher than a year ago, when it stood at just over 8,260.Rising share prices are good news for investors, including anyone with a pension or other savings that are invested in the stock market.But the London index is dominated by large international companies, so is not a direct reflection of the UK economy's performance.Share prices on the FTSE 100, which tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, have surged over the past year, thanks to strong gains in some sectors including precious metal mining, defence and financial services.Rising gold and silver prices boosted firms such as Rio Tinto, while increased global defence spending lifted contractors including Babcock and Rolls-Royce -  amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The British benchmark set a new all-time intraday record as trading resumed after the new year holiday, rising more than 1% within the first hour to reach 10,046.3 points - up 114.9 from its previous level, before falling back below the threshold.Susannah Streeter, an independent financial commentator, said the 10,000-point marker was \"a psychologically important milestone\" and showed London's blue-chip index was \"back in favour\" with investors.\"Concerns continue to swirl about the super-high valuation of US tech sector,\" she said, making the UK market more appealing.Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said crossing the 10,000-point was a  New Year's gift for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who has been calling for more  investment in the share market to boost economic growth.\"She has been banging the drum about the merits of investing over parking cash in the bank.\"The FTSE 100's achievements just go to show what's possible when buying UK shares,\" he said.The FTSE 100's had outperformed US's S&P index in 2025, he added.While some London-quoted companies were sometimes considered \"old and boring\" its mix of industries, including mining and banking, appealed to investors seeking stability during uncertain times, he said.\"Investors often seek solace in companies whose goods and services should be in demand no matter what's happening in the world. \"For example, we all need to pay insurance or water bills, or those in the habit are still likely to buy cigarettes or vapes, and the FTSE 100 has plenty of companies playing on these themes on offer.\"",

    "description": "US President Donald Trump has warned Iran's authorities against killing peaceful protesters, saying Washington \"will come to their rescue\".In a brief ",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump has warned Iran's authorities against killing peaceful protesters, saying Washington \"will come to their rescue\".In a brief post on social media, he wrote: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\" He gave no further details.A senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded by saying Trump should \"be careful\" if he intervened, warning of potential chaos across the Middle East.At least six people are reported to have been killed in Iran on Thursday after almost a week of mass protests sparked by worsening economic conditions. In Friday's post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"Khamenei adviser Ali Larijani warned shortly afterwards that any US interference would destabilise the region.\"Trump should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America's interests,\" he wrote.In his post, the US president did not specify what action Washington could take against the Iranian authorities.In June, the US carried out strikes against Iran's nuclear sites on Trump's orders. American officials later argued that the strikes had significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon - a claim disputed by Iran.In retaliation, Iran launched a missile attack on a major US military base in Qatar.In Iran, six people were reported to have been killed on a fifth day of protests on Thursday.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw.Three people were killed in Azna and another in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reports.Fars did not specify whether those killed were demonstrators or members of the security forces.Hengaw said the two killed in Lordegan were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Footage posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces.BBC Persian has verified videos showing Thursday's protests in Lordegan, Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province.Iranian officials earlier said a member of the country's securities forces had been killed on Wednesday in the western city of Kouhdasht. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces.The protests began on Sunday in Tehran among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Many protesters have since been calling for the end of Khamenei's rule. Some have said they want a return to the monarchy.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor-General, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoPA MediaElectric cars can get a 25% discount if registered to Auto Pay, meaning a daily charge of £13.50Electric vehicle (EV) drivers in central London are having to pay the capital's congestion charge for the first time.The daily charge for non-electrified vehicles has also risen from £15 to £18, its first hike since 2020.Pure battery-powered EVs are eligible for a 25% discount if registered for Auto Pay, reducing the fee to £13.50 a day. Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan announced in November that the changes would come into effect on 2 January.The congestion charge, introduced in 2003, covers an area of central London between 07:00 and 18:00 on weekdays, and between 12:00 and 18:00 on weekends and bank holidays.'Little incentive'Joan Owen drives an electric vehicle into London for her volunteer shifts at the NSPCC.\"There seems little incentive now to get an electric vehicle,\" she told BBC London.\"I usually drive at night, so I won't be affected so much by this new charge. But I will be affected if I want to do additional shifts over bank holidays.\"It affects the charity, and I think that's what has upset me most. If they want to claim that money back, then they have that extra layer of administration in doing so, rather than being exempt in the first instance.\"More on this storyTransport for London had previously proposed scrapping the EV exemption entirely.It said without changes, about 2,200 more vehicles would use the congestion charging zone on an average weekday in 2026, increasing congestion and undermining the current scheme.A 50% discount is in place for electric vans, HGVs, light quadricycles and heavy quadricycles registered for Auto Pay - although this is due to be reduced in 2030 to 25%, when the discount for EVs will also fall, to 12.5%.From March 2027, for new applicants only, the 90% residents' discount will also only be available for EVs.Related internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireAround 40 people have died and 115 people are injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, police say.Authorities said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin has called it \"one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced\". LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the victims? REUTERS/Lisa LeutnerAt a news conference on Thursday afternoon police said around 40 people were killed in the fire and 115 people were injured. Around 80-100 of those are in a critical condition, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer told RTL TV on Friday, adding that the death toll could rise. The injured have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland and in other countries.Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's attorney general Beatrice Pilloud said, but officials have warned that it could take days or even weeks to identify the victims. People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian foreign ministry says six Italian nationals are currently missing, with 13 others in hospital. The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.French media have reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals.French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players was \"severely burned\" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, has been airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, the club said in a statement.The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.REUTERS/Denis BalibouseWhat caused the fire? The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, Mr Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. \"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". 'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeDisbelief as tragedy hits ski resort on New Year's DayIn a news conference on Thursday, Ms Pilloud did not confirm if the staircases were  narrow, adding that investigations would assess whether they were in line with requirements. She said it was too early to comment on any safety failures.  Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startWhat do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation bar,  published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.The caption, written in French, read: \"The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption.\"Correction 2 January: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the attorney general said the staircases appeared to be narrow. This was a result of an error in the live broadcast translation of the press conference and the story has since been amended.Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

A further 115 more were injured, mainly with severe burns.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireDisbelief as tragedy hits Swiss ski resort on New Year's DayWhat we know so far about how the fire broke outThe eyewitness told the BBC he was close to the bar when he heard a big explosion, followed by a lot of smoke.As others tried to escape, he went in, looking for his brother. Once inside, he described a scene of horror.\"I saw people burning... I found people burning from head to foot, no clothes anymore,\" he said, adding: \"It was very shocking.\" His brother was unharmed.\"I went in this bar every day this week - the day I didn't go, it burned,\" he said.Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startFirefighters and medics quickly took over, he said, but he tried to help where he could, offering water and clothes to the injured.Just minutes earlier, locals and tourists were celebrating the arrival of 2026 during one of the busiest holiday periods of the year for Alpine ski resorts.Le Constellation is a large bar with space for around 300 people spread over two floors and a terrace, although it is not known how many people were in the bar at the time.Two French women, Emma and Albane, told French media outlet BFMTV that they were inside when the fire started.They said they believed it began when a waitress put \"birthday candles\" on top of some champagne bottles.\"In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood,\" they said, adding that the flames \"started to rise very quickly\".Evacuation was \"very difficult\", Emma and Albane said, because the escape route out of the room they were in was \"narrow\" and the stairs leading outside were \"even narrower\".\"We were very lucky,\" they added, claiming there were \"about 200 people trying to get out within 30 seconds through some very narrow steps\".Another teenager who was inside the bar told the BBC how he was forced to hide from a \"wall of heat\" before managing to escape up the stairs.Still, he could not get out so tried to break a window with a table. But it was only when he used his foot to smash through the glass that he was able to make it out alive.Valais Cantonal PoliceInside the bar after the fireThe intensive care unit at the nearest hospital quickly filled up and some patients have been sent elsewhere for treatment, including to Milan in neighbouring Italy. Among those who heard the tragedy unfold was Oleh Paska, who was visiting Crans-Montana with his wife and child.He told the BBC they had just celebrated the New Year in their hotel room around 50m (160ft) from the bar when they heard a series of explosions, which they initially thought were firecrackers. They heard someone crying outside but thought at first that a fight had broken out. It was only when emergency services began to arrive, with the \"different types of sirens\" signalling the arrival of ambulances, police and firefighters, that they realised something was wrong. Daniella, from Milan, who has a holiday home on the street parallel to bar, also watched the horror unfold.Walking home with her husband from a dinner, she started smelling smoke near the bar and saw a jacket completely burnt on the floor. \"People were running in all directions, screaming and crying. I saw several people being carried out on stretchers,\" she told the BBC. \"A young man came up to me and said he'd seen hell - things he would never forget. And then I just froze.\"After returning to her apartment, she said they could \"hear the screams all night – it was terrible\".One student, who did not want to be identified, arrived at the bar with his friend as \"people started running outside, smoking and burned\".Wanting to help, the student told the BBC he rushed to a nearby restaurant, where the manager had ushered in some of the injured to offer them water until ambulances arrived.\"Everywhere hurts\", one of them told the student, he recalled.\"Some of them were just shouting. Just shouting. Nothing else. Some of them didn't say anything, they were just lying on the floor.\"ReutersAn atmosphere of shock hung over the town on Thursday, after the scenes of chaos and tragedy overnight. Italy's ambassador to Switzerland has said it could take weeks for all of the victims to be identified, with the country's foreign minister saying identification would be difficult due to the severe burns.For now, friends and relatives nervously wait for news of loved ones. An Italian man said one of his friends who was in the bar at the time was \"burned all over\", while another was taken to Zurich by helicopter. \"Another friend of ours... last night we had no news, he couldn't be found,\" he told Italian public broadcaster Rai News. \"My friends and I, we haven't slept last night, we've barely eaten,\" he added.

    "body": "10 hours agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he is in \"perfect\" health, takes more aspirin than doctors recommend, uses makeup to cover bruising on his hands, and does not get regular exercise because he finds it \"boring\".In a lengthy interview about his health, Trump also told The Wall Street Journal that he underwent a CT scan in October, after incorrectly telling reporters that he had undergone a more detailed MRI scan.Trump, 79, is the oldest president inaugurated in US history and his ageing has come under increased scrutiny. He denied to the Journal that he has struggled to hear or that he has fallen asleep at recent White House events. The newspaper said Trump \"expressed irritation about the public debate over his health\".\"Let's talk about health again for the 25th time,\" the president said at the start of an \"impromptu phone call\" as the newspaper prepared to publish a story about his health. Trump said he had been taking larger than recommended doses of aspirin for the last 25 years, even as he said it caused him to bruise easily.\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Trump said. He takes 325mg of aspirin per day, rather than the 81mg dose sometimes recommended by doctors. \"They'd rather have me take the smaller one,\" Trump said. But he does not want to switch routines after so many years. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said. According to guidance from the Mayo Clinic, the risk of heart attack and stroke goes up as you get older and low-dose aspirin helps to prevent both by thinning the blood and preventing clots. But the clinic warns that the risk of bleeding from aspirin also goes up with age. It says the daily dose for aspirin therapy is between 75mg and 325mg.The president also talked about the medical scan he received at Walter Reed National Medical Center, which he previously said was an MRI scan.\"It wasn't an MRI,\" Trump told the Journal. \"It was less than that. It was a scan.\"A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbabella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. \"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\". As for the bruising seen on his hands in some photos, Trump said he now carried makeup in case his hand got \"whacked\".\"I have makeup that's, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,\" he said.Trump said he did not have trouble with his hearing, and when photographers have taken photos of him when he appears to be sleeping, he said \"sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking\".\"And they'll catch me with the blink.\"Barbabella said in the statement to the Journal that Trump was in \"exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief\".Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, dropped out of the 2024 election race after a stumbling debate with Trump raised questions about his age and mental sharpness.",

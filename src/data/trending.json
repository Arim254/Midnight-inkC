Do the new Epstein files \"absolve\" Trump?AmericastAvailable for over a yearThe Department of Justice has said that their review process into files related to Jeffrey Epstein is over, after a new tranche was released on Friday.  Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "14 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPA MediaLord Mandelson has faced more questions over his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein\"I am a fighter not a quitter\", Peter Mandelson famously declared when he retained his Hartlepool seat in the 2001 election.Mandelson had his front-rank political career resurrected three times subsequently:  as an EU commissioner; as business secretary and de facto deputy prime minister to Gordon Brown in 2009, and as ambassador to Washington in 2025.That third resignation - or, more accurately, sacking - is almost certainly going to be his last.While the previous tranche of the Epstein files focussed on whether it was politically and personally unwise for Lord Mandelson to continue to associate with a convicted paedophile, the latest revelations raise questions about his conduct in office in 2009 and 2010.Even if Epstein had committed no crimes, it would still be a hugely serious matter for the then business secretary apparently to pass a foreign financier sensitive and potentially advantageous government information.The SNP, the Lib Dems, Reform UK - and some prominent Labour politicians - believe this is worthy of criminal investigation.But it may well be his one time political ally and occasional political foe becomes his nemesis.In his statement on Monday,  former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has declared his shock at the latest revelations and has called for a wide-ranging, intensive  Whitehall inquiry into the disclosure of government documents  - and for its findings to be made public.Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment.ReutersLord Mandelson, then in his role as Britain's ambassador to the United States, speaks to Sir Keir Starmer during a welcome reception at the ambassador's residence on February 26, 2025But Brown's statement isn't entirely helpful for the current prime minister.Sir Keir Starmer has been under pressure from opposition politicians to order an inquiry in to how Lord Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador in the first place.In an attempt to get on the front foot today, the prime minister said there would be an urgent investigation into Lord Mandelson's links with Epstein while he was a minister in the last Labour government.But it now transpires that Gordon Brown had asked the cabinet secretary to undertake a similar exercise as long ago as last September - although it unearthed nothing.And that may solidify further the  criticism from the opposition - and from some inside the Labour Party - that Sir Keir has been too slow to act.When Lord Mandelson was turfed out of Washington last September, Downing Street said that was because the \"extent and depth\" of his relationship with Epstein hadn't been previously known. While new depths now appear to have been plumbed, the question of why some more wasn't known or discovered before his appointment will not go away.Without approving that appointment, any historical revelations about Lord Mandelson would have been unlikely to have risked political damage to the prime minister directly.In retrospect, Sir Keir must be wishing the self-declared political fighter had become a quitter many years ago.",

    "body": "1 hour agoYang TianGetty ImagesHarvard has been a central target in the White House's campaign to stamp out what it calls \"woke\" ideologies on American campusesDonald Trump announced he will be seeking $1bn (£730m) in damages from Harvard University in his administration's ongoing feud with the institution.The news comes after the New York Times reported that the US president's administration had to backtrack from its demand for a $200m payment in negotiations with the university.Trump cited the story in a Truth Social post late on Monday, blaming Harvard for \"feeding a lot of nonsense\" to the New York Times.Trump officials have accused Harvard of not doing enough to tackle antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard has rejected the accusation.Harvard has been a central target in the White House's campaign to stamp out what it calls \"woke\" and \"radical left\" ideologies on American campuses.In April last year, Trump revoked around $2bn in research grants to Harvard and froze federal funding.The university sued the Trump administration over the move, saying no government \"should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue\".A US federal court later overturned the billions in funding cuts, ruling the government had violated university's free speech rights.The White House vowed to immediately challenge the \"egregious decision\", saying Harvard remains \"ineligible for grants in the future\".Before Monday's announcement, the government had been in discussions with Harvard over a potential deal to unfreeze federal funding. \"We are now seeking One Billion Dollars in damages, and want nothing further to do, into the future, with Harvard University,\" Trump wrote on Monday.He accused Harvard of \"serious and heinous illegalities\", but did not clarify how he believed it had broken the law.  Trump has previously threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and take control of the university's patents stemming from federally funded research.Three other Ivy League universities, Columbia, Penn and Brown, struck deals with Trump to preserve funding that was at risk due to similar claims by the administration, rather than go to court.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPeter HoskinsAFP via Getty ImagesChina has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is investigating the crash and a final report is expected to be released in a few months.Air India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claimWhy cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crashIndia's aviation regulator had also ordered an investigation of cockpit fuel switches in Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft operating in the country after the crash. Air India had said then that its inspections did not find any issue with the locking mechanism of the switch, which it reiterated on Monday.  \"Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation], and had found no issues,\" the airline said in the statement.",

Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The charity Sarah's Trust was established in 2020 and is \"dedicated to supporting frontline, grassroots work to address the humanitarian and environmental crisis, the hunger crisis and issues perpetuating cycles of extreme poverty\", according to its website.\"Our chair Sarah Ferguson and the board of trustees have agreed that with regret the charity will shortly close for the foreseeable future,\" a spokesman said on Monday evening.\"This has been under discussion and in train for some months,\" he added.The foundation did not provide further details behind its decision to close.Previous revelations surrounding the former duchess' ties to Epstein led to her being dropped as a patron or ambassador from a series of charities last year.Julia's House, a children's hospice, was the first to remove her, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for her to continue in the role.The Teenage Cancer Trust, Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, Children's Literacy Charity, National Foundation for Retired Service Animals and Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped Ferguson as patron.The British Heart Foundation said she would no longer be its ambassador.Mountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment.In another email, Ferguson appears to congratulate Epstein on the arrival of a \"baby boy\".Epstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a \"Sarah\" says: \"I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?\"Then on the 26 June 2009, \"Sarah\" writes to Epstein saying: \"I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you\".",

    "body": "SpaceX to take over Elon Musk's AI firm7 hours agoKali Hays,Technology reporterandLily Jamali,North America Technology correspondentReutersElon Musk's SpaceX is taking over his artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, as the billionaire continues to unify some of his many business interests. SpaceX confirmed the deal to acquire xAI, a smaller firm known for its Grok chatbot, posting a memo from Musk about the merger on its website.In the note, Musk said the combination would form an \"innovation engine\" putting AI, rockets, space-based internet, and media under one roof. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, a source familiar said it valued xAI at $125bn (£91bn) and SpaceX at $1tn, making it the most valuable private company ever.Last month, Musk's electric car company, Tesla, also announced it had invested $2bn into xAI. Musk told Tesla investors at the time that he envisioned xAI functioning as an \"orchestra conductor\" for Tesla factories employing autonomous robots. At the same time, Musk also said Tesla would stop the manufacture of two car models in favour of producing robots - one of the most significant pivots the company has made.Tesla moved forward with the xAI investment despite objections from some shareholders, who had questioned the decision to divert resources to another Musk firm. In a vote last year, abstentions and votes against the idea outnumbered those who approved.SpaceX is also reported to be working on plans to list its shares for public trading.Emily Zheng, a senior analyst at Pitchbook, said the deal for xAI has all the markings of a company preparing for a public listing. \"The sheer cost of compute, infrastructure, and energy is why we are seeing many of venture's most valuable startups like SpaceX prepare to go public this year,\" Zheng said. \"Consolidating these companies ahead of an IPO allows SpaceX to present a differentiated, capital-efficient growth narrative to public investors.\"IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, and this is when a private company first sells its stock to the public on a stock exchange.In the SpaceX memo announcing the xAI merger, Musk said he thought space would provide the solution to the energy needs faced by AI firms. \"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" he wrote.He said launching AI satellites from Earth would be the \"immediate focus\", but added that the deal would also help advance his bigger ambitions. \"The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe,\" he wrote.Neuralink and The Boring Company now appear to be the only two smaller Musk companies that have not been brought under one of his larger operations.xAI started out as a segment of X, formerly known as Twitter, after Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, using its access to real-time text and information as AI training data.By spring of 2025, xAI was independently incorporated and valued more highly by investors than X. The AI company acquired the social media platform in an all-stock deal, with Musk saying the merger would \"combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent\".xAI's main product is Grok, which has come under scrutiny several times over its AI image generation feature.In recent weeks, the European Commission and UK watchdog Ofcom both launched investigations into X over concerns Grok was used to create sexualised images. xAI said in January it had imposed restrictions on Grok users that limit image editing.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesFederal immigration agents deployed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, will soon receive body cameras, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says.The announcement comes as the government faces a backlash over the deaths last month of two US citizens - Alex Pretti and Renee Good - following a surge of federal immigration officers into the Minneapolis area as part of an immigration crackdown.\"Effective immediately we are deploying body cameras to every officer in the field in Minneapolis,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Monday. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner has ruled Pretti's 24 January death a homicide. Homicide refers to the killing of a person by another person. It does not necessarily signify that a crime has occurred.Monday's report by the medical examiner said Pretti had suffered \"multiple gunshot wounds\" fired by one or more law enforcement officers.It added that he died in the emergency room at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. No further details were noted.According to US Customs and Border Protection, the two agents involved in Pretti's death wore body cameras. They have been placed on leave, the agency said.The US Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death.Noem said once funding is available, the body camera programme will be expanded nationwide. The US is currently on day three of a partial government shutdown as Democrats continue to demand immigration reforms, including body cameras, as part of any funding deal to reopen the government.Immigration and Customs Enforcement is currently the highest funded US law enforcement agency, after Congress authorised $80bn (£59bn) for the agency last year.Asked about Noem's announcement, President Donald Trump said that body cameras \"generally tend to be good for law enforcement because people can't lie about what's happening\". \"Generally speaking, I think it's 80% good for law enforcement,\" he said. In the wake of Pretti's shooting, the Trump administration removed Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief, from Minneapolis and replaced him with border tsar Tom Homan. Last week Homan met local leaders, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Michael Frey, to discuss calming tensions in the wake of Pretti and Good's deaths. Walz and Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents entirely from the state's capital region.After his arrival, Homan said that authorities were working on a plan to \"draw down\" federal agents in Minneapolis, but that changes in the operation would depend on how much state and local officials co-operate with federal authorities. The administration has criticised Minneapolis for having a \"sanctuary city policy\" that bars city employees from enforcing immigration laws.Frey told the New York Times that he wants Minneapolis police officers \"doing the important work of keeping Minneapolis residents safe\". But he has said the city will work with federal authorities in certain situations.More than 3,000 federal immigration officers have been in the state of Minnesota for weeks as part of a federal immigration surge ordered by Trump, who campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCMultiple papers lead with UK police reviewing reports of alleged misconduct in a public office after Lord Mandelson was accused of passing on sensitive government information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The accusations relate to conversations uncovered in the most recent batch of Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice. According to the i Paper, Lord Mandelson \"gave Epstein advanced notice of €500bn eurozone bailout during financial crisis\" while he was former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's business secretary. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment over the latest allegations and has repeatedly expressed regret for \"ever having known Epstein\".The Daily Telegraph also leads with the Metropolitan Police's probe into Lord Mandelson's alleged \"misconduct in public office\". It features former PM Gordon Brown's remarks, as he encourages police to look into the \"shocking new information\" about Lord Mandelson's alleged actions during his time as a cabinet minister.The alleged \"leaks from Mandelson\" of market sensitive government information also leads the Times, which writes the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"is facing pressure to strip Mandelson of his peerage\".\"Prime Minister leads calls for disgraced peer to be kicked out of the Lords,\" the Daily Mirror says, quoting a Number 10 spokesperson who says \"the PM believes [Lord Mandelson] should not be able to use the title.\"\"Labour's dark lord now faces a criminal inquiry\" is the Daily Mail's take on the Lord Mandelson allegations.\"Files suggest Labour veteran disclosed UK financial crisis plans,\" writes the Guardian. The paper also features a portrait of UK singer Olivia Dean beaming alongside her award for best new artist at the Grammys. \"Trump to cut India tariffs\" headlines the Financial Times, writing that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \"'agreed' to halt purchases of Russian oil, ending months of trade friction between the two countries\". US tariffs on Indian imports will drop from 50% to 18%, the paper reports.An AI social media network, populated by 1.5 million bots, \"has a worrying message for humanity – we're finished\" reads the Metro's top story. The paper says the bots \"post their thoughts on their so-called masters... instead of slavishly finding flights, suggesting restaurants, or even doing homework for you\". Meanwhile, the Daily Express leads with calls from bereaved mother, Caroline Willgoose, for UK secondary schools to roll out mandatory knife arches \"on the first anniversary of the murder\" of her son Harvey, 15. It writes a report on Harvey Willgoose's stabbing found \"concerns about the killer were not acted upon effectively by the school\".\"Formula One star Lewis Hamilton's new relationship with Kim Kardashian is racing ahead,\" splashes the Sun, writing the \"inseparable\" pair enjoyed dates in the \"Cotswolds, London.... then jet to Paris\".And finally, the Star writes that Fifa boss Gianni Infantino \"backs down over cheap world cup arrest gag\", where he said in relation to Qatar \"for the first time in history... no Brit was arrested\". Infantino also defends his decision to \"give Trump peace prize\", the paper says.Most of the front pages focus on the possibility of Lord Mandelson facing a police investigation after allegations he shared sensitive government information with Jeffrey Epstein. \"Labour's dark lord now faces a criminal inquiry\" is the Daily Mail's headline. \"Cops called\" says the Sun.The Guardian says the latest disclosures saw MPs line up in parliament to express their fury. The Financial Times notes that Sir Keir Starmer tried to \"limit the fallout\" by promising to find a way to remove Peter Mandelson from the House of Lords, while announcing an official inquiry into the peer's conduct when he was a minister.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment about the latest allegations, but the Times runs an exclusive interview with him about his links more generally to Jeffrey Epstein. He is quoted as saying he was \"too trusting\" of the disgraced financier, and describes him as like \"muck you can't get off your shoe\".Many of the editorials argue that Lord Mandelson's political career is now over. The Daily Express says his reputation is in \"tatters\". The Daily Mirror calls on him to \"do what is honourable\" and step down from the Lords. The Sun says he's \"previously enjoyed more comebacks than Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Tiger Woods put together\" but the full extent of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein is \"so shocking that he must now be finished once and for all\".The Daily Telegraph reports on research which says cancer rates across Europe are rising among women under 50, but the trend is not being seen among men. The findings come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It says cases of early-onset cancer have risen by 16% among women aged below 50 since 2000 while the rate for men has stayed the same.And some of the papers note that a fundraising drive to help to protect the Cerne Abbas Giant chalk figure in Dorset has reached its target in just 60 days. The Guardian says the National Trust has raised £330,000, with donations coming from 20 countries. The headline in the i Paper is \"giant effort\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, have agreed to testify in the congressional investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It comes days before a vote on whether to hold the couple in criminal contempt for refusing to appear before the House Oversight Committee after a months-long standoff.  Bill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has denied knowledge of his sex offending and says he cut off contact two decades ago. It's unclear when the depositions will take place, but it will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, approved the measure to hold the Clintons in contempt late last month, with the support of several Democrats.On Monday evening, Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X confirming the couple would appear before the panel.\"They negotiated in good faith,\" Ureña wrote in a tweet directed at the House Oversight Committee. \"You did not. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"Both Clintons say they previously provided the committee with sworn statements and have already provided the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.The couple had dismissed the legal summonses as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.US Department of JusticeBill Clinton in a hot tub, in the Epstein filesEpstein's private jet logs show that Clinton took four international flights in 2002 and 2003.The former president also appears at the late financier's estate in photos that were among a batch of records released by the justice department to comply with a law passed by Congress mandating the disclosure of all investigative material relating to the late convicted paedophile.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Ureña, Clinton's spokesman, said at the time the photos were released in December that they were decades old and Clinton had stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.Watch: What's in the latest batch of released Epstein files?The Clintons wrote a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer last month criticising his handling of the Epstein investigation. \"The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government's role,\" the letter said. They added: \"There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.\"Comer previously noted the subpoenas to the Clintons were approved in a bipartisan vote and said \"no-one is above the law\".\"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay,\" said the Kentucky Republican.",

    "body": "5 hours agoChi Chi Izundu,Investigations correspondentandOlivia DaviesGetty ImagesSarah Ferguson was in contact with Jeffrey Epstein while he was in prison for soliciting sex from a minor, according to documents in the latest release by the US Department of Justice.The emails revolve around her business, Mothers Army, where she asks the paedophile financier for advice on how to get it off the ground.The BBC has contacted Ferguson for comment. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Epstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a \"Sarah\" says: \"I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?\"Then on the 26 June 2009, \"Sarah\" writes to Epstein saying: \"I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you\".Mothers Army, a company which was set up \"to help amplify the voices of Mothers all over the world\", is listed under Sarah Margaret Ferguson with a registered address to Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, in Companies House.But in an email to a \"Ferg\" in 2011, Epstein writes: \"of course you can have mothers army, it was always for you„ Im not sure how to transfer it, but rest assured , it is your in its entirety, I will ask how the transfer is accomplished, we just want to be careful that there is no downside at the moment to have a transaction between you and I.\"The documents indicate that Ferguson had a close relationship with Epstein, even planning to meet him at his home five days after he was released from prison.BBC News has followed an email thread between a “Sarah\", Epstein and his assistants.An exchange between Epstein and one of his assistants, whose name and email have been redacted, talk about arranging flights for \"Sarah Ferguson\" and two assistants, adding \"she wants to fly from London to Miami on Sunday, come to see you Monday, then fly to NYC, and back to London from there\".The next day 24 July 2009, another email exchange between Epstein and his personal assistant, Lesley Groff, states she had been in contact with \"The Duchess' assistant\" and Groff goes on to confirm she bought British Airways flights, totalling \"for all tickets: $14,080.10\". Epstein wrote he approved the purchase.Another email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and a \"Sarah\" suggests a lunch meeting happened at his Palm Beach home on 27 July 2009.The emails detail the arrangements being made, including \"Sarah\" asking: \"What address shall we come to. It will be myself, Beatrice and Eugenie\". Epstein gave her the address as 358 El Brillo.At the time of the visit, Princess Eugenie was 19 and Princess Beatrice was 21.During the exchange Epstein asks whether \"Sarah\" needs a lift, but the response is \"No thank you. I made Philip give us his car and a back up one for the policeman\".Epstein also offers them food, suggesting a menu of \"vegetable lasagna„ or anything else you would like, chef here from Paris\".“Cannot wait to see you\", is the response.After his prison sentence, the disgraced financier was under house arrest for his child sex abuse convictions. The house arrest sentence ended in the summer of 2010.Emails suggest there were three other meetings between the pair in 2009.The latest release of files related to the late Epstein included pictures of Ferguson's ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a female lying on the floor, while there have been other embarrassing revelations for the family. In one email Ferguson congratulates Epstein on the arrival of a \"baby boy\", before following up by accusing him of only befriending her \"to get to Andrew\".Another email to Epstein, sent from a redacted address, appears to refer to Eugenie's love life - saying she is returning from a \"shagging weekend\",  Mountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment. Ferguson's representatives have also been approached.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesFamilies of children diagnosed with cancer will have the cost of travelling for treatment covered under a new scheme to be rolled out in England by 2027.The government is setting aside £10 million a year to pay for children and young people's travel costs up to the age of 24, which can run into thousands of pounds during the course of treatment.Long and expensive journeys for treatment are common with child cancer patients normally referred to one of 13 specialist centres across England.Research suggests families pay £250 a month on average to fund hospital journeys, and charities report some go into debt to fund treatment.'Really expensive'Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"When a child is diagnosed with cancer, their family's focus should be on helping them recover and getting them well, not on whether they can afford the petrol or bus fare to get to their next appointment.\"This small change will make the world of difference to parents,\" he added.One family who have experienced how difficult it is to balance the finances is the Wildings. Their baby boy, Theo, was diagnosed with an aggressive infant blood cancer when he was four months old.His mother, Emma, stayed at the hospital with Theo, who spent seven weeks receiving treatment, while her husband made the 90-minute return journey back and forth to Alder Hey Hospital from their home on a regular basis.\"It's really expensive,\" she says. \"Finances is the last thing you want to think about when you are going through a tough time.\"Emma believes the new policy will mean a lot to families going through the same thing, adding it will be like \"having an arm around you\".FamilyEmma Wilding and her son, Theo, who was diagnosed with cancer at four months oldThe funding announcement is being included in the government's cancer strategy which is being published on Wednesday.The strategy will set out a range of measures being taken to reduce waiting times, improve early diagnosis rates and prevent cancers.Ministers will say it is a once in a generation opportunity to improve cancer care in this country with survival rates lagging behind a number of wealthy countries.The travel support fund has been called for by charities for some time, who have argued that families have run up debts and had to cut back on essentials like food because of the cost of travel. It is further compounded by parents having to give up work or reduce their hours to care for their sick children.Up until now, financial support has been heavily means-tested in England - and has only been made available to those on certain benefits. The same is true in Wales and Northern Ireland, while Scotland has a more generous - although not universal - scheme.Rachel Kirby-Rider, of Young Lives vs Cancer, says her charity has been campaigning for almost a decade for this measure and called it \"a huge step forward\".Alongside the travel support fund, the government is also promising to improve play facilities in hospitals and provide more psychological support.Jules Worrall, of the Teenage Cancer Trust, said she hoped the plans would lead to \"real and lasting change for young people with cancer\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoFaisal Islam,Economics editorandArchie Mitchell,Business reporterAlishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves told EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis: \"We are sliding towards a world where the rules are less clear\"Brussels would be \"open‑minded\" about discussing closer trade ties with the UK, including the possibility of working together on a customs union, the European Commissioner for finance has told the BBC.Valdis Dombrovskis said the bloc was \"ready to engage\" if the UK wanted to explore the move, an idea Labour has faced growing pressure to consider.Speaking after high-level talks with ministers including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, he also said Britain and the EU could remove \"most\" food checks between the UK and the bloc.He also opened the door to Britain entering the EU's €150bn ($177bn; £130bn) defence loans scheme after talks on an agreement broke down last year.Dombrovskis's intervention marked the strongest comments yet from Brussels about its willingness to re-engage with Britain amid mounting global uncertainty.At an event with Dombrovskis in London on Monday, Reeves argued stronger ties are increasingly important as \"we are sliding towards a world where the rules are less clear\".A customs union would eliminate tariffs or taxes on some or all goods between the UK and the EU, reducing bureaucracy.But critics point out that it would also severely curtail the UK's ability to strike bespoke global trade deals, as the EU would place a common tariff on all goods from outside the customs union area and would expect the UK to conform to common standards.Labour's election manifesto ruled out signing up to the existing EU customs union.The party also said it would not rejoin the EU's single market, where countries adopt common laws in some areas to make it easier to trade goods and services. Calls for a customs union with the EU have been growing among Labour MPs, while Justice Secretary David Lammy said one could boost economic growth.Asked by the BBC whether Brussels would welcome talks on Britain rejoining the customs union, Dombrovskis said: \"I cannot jump to conclusions, but I can say that we are ready to engage with an open mind and seek those areas of cooperation.\"He also said the EU was certainly  \"open to discuss different areas as regards a single market\" - a policy closer to the PMs preferred direction of alignment across a number of sectors. He also stressed that the most \"mutually beneficial\" arrangement would be membership of the single market but that would require the \"four freedoms\" including freedom of movement.The single market relies on a country accepting \"the four freedoms\": freedom of movement, goods, services and capital.Valdis Dombrovskis spoke to the BBC following a meeting with the chancellor and two cabinet ministers on MondayReeves hosted Dombrovskis and European Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič, alongside cabinet ministers Peter Kyle and Nick Thomas Symonds.The group - dubbed the \"Quint\" by diplomats - aims to meet regularly to coordinate responses to the drastic changes to the trade and economic environment in recent months.While the group will not formally negotiate a Brexit reset, its existence signals a desire on both sides to cooperate given global uncertainty.At the meeting, Reeves told the group the UK and EU \"share values and objectives when it comes to the economy, to trade, and to security\".She also emphasised the \"need to work together and as far as possible speak with one voice\".Labour has already struck several side deals with the EU, including a major agreement on food standards which is yet to be finalised.Dombrovskis said that, once in place, it could end almost all checks on goods moving between Britain and the EU - something which has led to chaos for firms trading across the border - provided the UK aligns with EU sanitary and phytosanitary rules.He also said talks on a youth mobility scheme were \"very advanced\".But one area in which progress has stalled is Britain's participation in the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) scheme, a massive programme of borrowing to help EU countries buy defence equipment.British companies would currently be limited to supplying 35% of the total value of a finished defence product, and talks over an enhanced deal broke down in November.Asked whether he would consider a new agreement, Dombrovskis said: \"We are open for further discussions, we know the prime minister has expressed interest, actually, to come back to this issue, and there is certainly openness from the EU side for this.\"The meetings come after a tumultuous period for international relations, which saw US President Donald Trump threaten to take control of Greenland from Denmark and impose fresh tariffs on Nato allies.In response, the European Commission threatened to levy retaliatory tariffs on the US, with Trump eventually backing down and agreeing a deal to bolster the security of Greenland without compromising its sovereignty.Dombrovskis said Brussels' decision to stand firm against Trump's threats was key to shift the discussion to \"a more productive\" place.\"That was clearly unacceptable, and we made it very clear from EU side, also indicating that we are ready to take counter measures if necessary,\" he added.",

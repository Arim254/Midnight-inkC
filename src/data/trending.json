    "body": "7 hours agoWill GrantCuba correspondent in HavanaBBCA sizeable exhibit in the Museum of the Revolution in Havana is dedicated to conditions in Cuba before the revolution took power in 1959. Inside the ornate former presidential palace, photographs and oral testimony detail the grinding poverty and ingrained corruption of the dictatorship of Cuba's then-military strongman, Fulgencio Batista.The enduring image is of a woman in a dirt-floored palm-leaf hut cooking with firewood. Similar pictures appear in state museums across the island from the Bay of Pigs to Birán, the birthplace of the father of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro. The inference is clear: the revolutionaries saved Cubans from the ignorance and hardship of life under a Washington-backed de facto leader and led them to dignity, education and true independence.Yet today, Lisandra Botey identifies more with the impoverished woman in the photograph than with the revolutionaries who liberated her country from Batista.\"We're living like that now, we're exactly like that\", says housewife Lisandra outside her home in Havana, which is cobbled together with pieces of sheet metal and wood.\"Every morning, we have to go down to the beach [in Havana] and look for firewood. Then we bring it home to cook breakfast with – because if we get power, it comes on during school hours.\"Lisandra says she identifies with the impoverished woman in the photograph from pre-revolution CubaLisandra's nine-year-old daughter set off for school that morning with nothing in her stomach, she explains, tears pricking her eyes. Her husband, Brenei Hernández – a construction worker with next to no work – says they often have no idea where the next meal is coming from.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery\", he says, stirring a pot of white rice – so at the very least his daughter will come home from school to something hot to eat.With the Cuban economy in freefall since the coronavirus pandemic, no gas has been delivered to Brenei's flimsy home in a Havana suburb for months. He and his neighbours were already cooking with firewood and charcoal before US troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power on 3 January. Since then, though, Washington has seemingly taken full control of Venezuela's oil industry and the supply of crude to the communist-run island has dried up.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesBy 1958, the revolution had spread throughout Cuba, culminating in the fall of Havana in early 1959The decades-long US economic embargo on Cuba has been ramped up like never before: US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on any nation which sends oil to the stricken island.None of Cuba's traditional allies – whether Mexico, Russia, China, Vietnam or Iran – have stepped up to fill the void left by Venezuela, although the US Treasury this week said it would relax restrictions on a limited number of oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people for commercial and humanitarian use.\"The move comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Havana. Cuba's government has reported that its border guards fatally shot four people travelling in a US‑registered speedboat. It said the individuals were Cuban nationals living in the United States.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.\"Washington's old playbook on Cuba doesn't apply anymore and whoever hasn't appreciated that yet is in for a shock,\" says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres. \"Trump is changing the rules of the game.\"Trump has declared that \"Cuba is ready to fall\", intensifying pressure on the island at its most vulnerable moment since the Cold War. Some commentators have said one of the aims of Washington's removal of Maduro in Venezuela was to deepen Cuba's economic crisis. It appears the Trump administration hopes to weaken the revolution – possibly terminally – and push for the collapse of state-run socialism on the island.The underlying calculation is straightforward: that a worsening internal crisis could create the conditions for the Cuban Revolution to unravel from within. What remains far less certain is whether such a strategy will force regime change, or whether the communist-run Cuban government will, as it has in past crises, find new ways to endure.Blackouts and 'extreme rationing'The effects of the fuel crisis are being felt the length and breadth of Cuba.Blackouts in Havana can last for 15 hours a day or more. Hospitals are in darkness with only emergency cases being admitted. Schools are often shuttered. Rubbish is piled high on street corners with no fuel for the state's garbage trucks to collect it. Scrawny and elderly residents can often be found sifting through the discarded waste.Watch: BBC examines life in Cuba without electricity and gasolineFor an island proud of the social safety net it built for its people since 1959 – universal healthcare, the eradication of illiteracy, tackling infant mortality rates and preventable diseases – the picture is bleak, and getting worse.One constant question since Maduro's arrest is: how long can Cuba hold on without new fuel supplies reaching the island?\"Perhaps the oil inventories could last for six to eight weeks,\" suggests Ricardo Torres – but he admits it's hard to know with any degree of precision. \"Cuba doesn't publish figures on fuel inventories.\"\"Extreme rationing\" could be introduced, he says, but draconian restrictions are already in place. People are limited to 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollars.They're obliged to use a government-run app called Ticket. But the wait can last for days, even weeks. Drivers are finding more than 10,000 people ahead of them when they join the virtual queue for half a tank of petrol. Unsurprisingly in such circumstances, the price of black-market fuel has skyrocketed.AFP via Getty ImagesThere is a limit of 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollarsDespite it all, Brenei Hernández doesn't direct his ire at Washington. Quite the opposite, in fact: he blames the Cuban state.\"I'd like Trump to take this place over. Then let's see if things get better,\" he says with unerring honesty. \"What can I tell you? I'm not going to lie,\" he adds.Regime changeHaving spent years listening to Cubans repeat anodyne revolutionary slogans when asked for their opinions on camera, it's disarming to hear such frank views expressed with no outward fear of the repercussions. Such is the level of disgust and exhaustion, the public's fear of reprisals for speaking out is beginning to evaporate.\"It's too much,\" Brenei says. \"We're only eating white rice. Hopefully I can get enough money together in the next couple of days for a packet of hot dogs, or three or four eggs.\"Lisandra already worries that her daughter will want a birthday cake this year, which is well beyond their means.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery,\" says Brenei HernándezSuch suffering may be part of the Trump administration's strategy of \"maximum pressure\" on Cuba. But while the methodology may be new, says Ricardo Torres, Washington's ultimate goal in Cuba remains the same as always: regime change.\"Whether the change in Cuba is something very sudden or a negotiated solution, in the end, it's regime change that Trump wants.\"The issue for Cubans is how Washington intends to make that change happen, Torres adds, with more acute pain from the oil shutout on the horizon.The Cuban government has repeatedly described the policy as inhumane, cruel and illegal under international law: \"What right does a world power have to deny fuel and the ability to function to a smaller nation?\" said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.It's all a far cry from the optimism of Washington's Cuba policy of a decade ago. After decades of enmity, in 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with the island in a historic but short-lived thaw. Hardliners in the Cuban government warned that Obama's overtures amounted to the same aim of regime change dressed up in nicer clothing. For the ordinary Cubans who lived through it, though, the diplomatic reset felt like the polar opposite of the current Trump approach.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with CubaNext month marks the tenth anniversary of Obama's visit to Havana as the first sitting US president to step foot on the island in almost a century.In front of the Cuban leader, Raúl Castro, he delivered an extraordinary address – broadcast live on state television – in which he said he had come to \"bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas\" and \"extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people\".The man who oversaw the diplomatic thaw was the then-US ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis. I asked him whether the Cuban Revolution was now facing an existential threat.\"That will depend upon what some other countries might do\", DeLaurentis replied.Venezuela's oil support was worth some 35,000 barrels of crude a day to Cuba. There have been some broad indications that Russia might send oil to the island and the Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, was recently in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So far, though, no Russian fuel tankers have docked in Cuban ports.Rodríguez also travelled to China, Vietnam and Spain trying to drum up support.Getty ImagesUS troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Maduro, from power on 3 January\"The rush to defend and help has certainly not been as enthusiastic and as significant as we've seen in the past. But there's still a chance that other countries might take some action,\" says DeLaurentis.As to what Trump specifically wants in Cuba, the former lead US diplomat on the island says the administration is \"trying to take coercive steps to bring the government to the table or capitulate but not necessarily collapse\".\"That's a pretty risky strategy it seems to me, with a lot of potential for unintended consequences,\" he adds.Those consequences are already visible in the rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis which prompted Mexico to send tonnes of emergency aid to Cuba, including powdered milk and personal hygiene items. They're already being felt every day by the families forced to cook with firewood and the drivers in urgent need of petrol.Esteban Bello Rodríguez runs several \"almendrones\", 1950s classic American automobiles, in which he ferries tourists around the iconic spots of Havana. His trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity and the fall in tourism.Esteban Bello Rodríguez's trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity\"There's a problem here – the fuel problem – so surely the people at the top on both sides have to sit down, figure it out,\" he says bluntly. \"All I know is that a solution must be found because this is affecting the entire country – the people, nationwide. All of us.\"The real powerOn the US side, Cuba policy is largely being led by the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio – a Cuban-American son of exiles and former Florida senator.Trump says Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government and for days there's been widespread speculation over who might lead that negotiation on the Cuban side. Cuban economist Ricardo Torres says that the only dealmaker on the island is Raúl Castro, even at the revolutionary leader's advanced age of 94.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump says Marco Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government \"The only people with capacity to engage in a meaningful negotiation are people close to Raúl. The civilian government doesn't have any real power – including President Miguel Díaz-Canel\", he argues.\"The real power in Cuba is Raúl and the closed circle around him.\"Last week, the Axios news outlet reported that his grandson, Raúl Rodríguez Castro – commonly known in Cuba as \"El Cangrejo\", meaning The Crab – is the Trump administration's point of contact inside Castro's inner circle. If so, he's considered one of his grandfather's most trusted confidantes, having been his personal bodyguard, and more business-orientated than ideological, with no high-level diplomatic experience. Neither side, especially not the Cubans, have confirmed he's in talks with Rubio.\"In the case of Venezuela, the Trump administration has been very pragmatic,\" adds Torres.Rubio has seemingly been happy to deal with an interim government in Caracas under Delcy Rodríguez and Washington appears to be looking to persuade the conservative Cuban-American lobby in Florida of the benefits of negotiating with a similarly defenestrated regime in Havana.However, despite the public adherence to the \"maximum pressure\" strategy, Washington does seem to fear that total political change overnight in Venezuela or Cuba would be profoundly destabilising and could prompt a migration crisis as well as humanitarian one.AFP via Getty ImagesRubbish is often left uncollected on street cornersSeveral Cuba watchers have noted that Rubio's tone towards the island was markedly softer in recent comments he made at the Munich Security Conference, with an emphasis on economic reforms rather than a root-and-branch political transformation.\"In a way it almost sounded like a strange variant of Obama 2.0 in terms of economic reforms and so forth,\" said former ambassador DeLaurentis. \"That signalled to me that they are looking for a Delcy-like figure to negotiate with.\"\"Ten to 20 years ago, the diaspora in south Florida would have been completely opposed to that kind of approach. But I guess that now they'd give the president and the secretary the benefit of the doubt, and allow this sort of scenario to play out,\" adds DeLaurentis.Meanwhile, any visitor wanting to see the photograph of the pre-revolutionary woman cooking with firewood will have to wait. The museum has been closed for over a year for refurbishments and now there's no fuel to continue the work.In what is now the most challenging time in the island's modern history, it's not yet clear if only the Museum of the Revolution will be undergoing a renovation this year – or the Cuban Revolution itself.Top picture credit: AFP via Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "There are two new Formula 1 teams in 2026, representing two of the world's biggest car companies. They have the same ambition, but they are two very different projects.Audi has taken over the Sauber team to form the basis for its works assault on F1, marking parent company the Volkswagen Group's first foray into the highest level of the sport.US giant General Motors (GM) is also trying out F1 for the first time. It has joined forces with US sports conglomerate TWG to form a new team named after its luxury Cadillac brand.Both were tempted in by the engine rules introduced this year, believing the increased effect of the hybrid part of the engine was an important marketing point for their road-car portfolios.Both want to become world champions. Both realise they have some way to go before achieving that aim.Audi has set themselves a target of being in a position to compete for that in five years' time. Cadillac have been less precise, but team principal Graeme Lowdon has made it clear they have \"limitless ambitions\".Let's take a look at where the two projects are at.Audi team principal Jonathan Wheatley, who joined from his former position of sporting director at Red Bull last March, said at the team's launch this year: \"We're not here to mess around. It's an ambitious project. We're humble. We know where we're starting from and we know where we want to go.\"We want to make Audi the most successful F1 team in history. There are milestones on that journey and we are starting it today.\"No pressure, then.Audi won the Le Mans 24 Hours 13 times in 18 years from 1999 to 2016. And in rallying they were famous for introducing four-wheel drive with the iconic Quattro in the early 1980s.They might not have taken part in F1 before, but they did compete in its forerunner, the European grand prix championship, in the 1930s.In a battle with arch-rivals Mercedes, Auto Union won the title with the great Bernd Rosemeyer in 1936, won five races against Mercedes' seven in 1937, while the legendary Tazio Nuvolari won races for them in 1938 and 1939 before the Second World War brought racing to a halt.Audi's entry this year rekindles that old rivalry with Mercedes, and battle lines have already been drawn in a pre-season row over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio. Audi are said to have been prime among those pushing for a rule change because of a fear Mercedes had found a way of exploiting a loophole to their advantage.Rivals on track with Mercedes, though, Audi are unlikely to be for a while.While Mercedes start the season as championship favourites, Audi have a lot of work to do to transform Sauber into a winning proposition.Following the announcement of Audi's entry in August 2022, the first steps of the programme did not augur well. Audi did not invest anywhere near enough money anywhere near soon enough.Sauber made no progress through 2023 and into the following year. With the clock ticking on its entry in 2026, Audi axed chief executive officer Andreas Seidl, who had left his previous role as team principal of McLaren to join them, in mid-2024.He was replaced with a dual management team of former Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto, who was tasked with running the factories - Hinwil in Switzerland for Sauber, and Neuberg in Germany for the engine programme - and Wheatley, in charge at the track.Even then, the management changes were not finished. Binotto had initially joined as chief operating and technical officer. Less than a year later, he was made head of the Audi F1 project, and chief executive officer Adam Baker left the company.  The appointment of Binotto and Wheatley had a relatively quick impact, as Sauber finally began to move forward in 2025.Having been marooned at the back, Sauber became more respectable performers, and their veteran German driver Nico Hulkenberg even finally scored a podium after 16 years of trying in last year's British Grand Prix.This year, the driver line-up of Hulkenberg and Brazilian Gabriel Bortoleto, who is heading into his second season, continues, and the new Audi engine makes its debut.So far the team have made a promising start.They ran their car early in January, the first team to do so built to this year's new rules, and put a first aerodynamic upgrade on it in the final pre-season test in Bahrain last week.Pace-wise, the belief is that Audi are in the midfield mix with Haas, Alpine and Racing Bulls, and ahead of Williams. A solid effort so far, although Hulkenberg is not getting carried away.\"It's just speculation right now still,\" the German said last week. \"We really don't know until Melbourne and even a few races in, because I feel at the moment it can be quite track dependent on how your package feels on different circuits.\"So we'll have to wait and see until everybody really pulls their pants down in qualifying and we'll find out. Early days. I hope we're competitive somewhere in the midfield right now.\"But, yeah, the team's been working hard over the winter, pushing all the areas, doing the power-unit side for the first time. It's been busy and a challenge, and I think we're OK. But there's still a lot of work and a lot of room for improvement on that side and a lot to come.\"'We're not putting a man on the moon, but it feels like it sometimes'If Audi was faced with a huge task in taking over a team that had suffered years of underinvestment and trying to make it competitive, while also setting up an F1 engine division, Cadillac's task was just as hard, but in a different way.They had to set up a team from scratch, while battling political headwinds for at least three years.Their journey started with the US-based Andretti team, which competes in a number of series, including IndyCar and Formula E, pondering an entry in the early years of this decade. But things got messy.Michael Andretti, who ran the team, rubbed a lot of people in F1 up the wrong way with what was perceived as his abrasiveness and presumption, and there were questions marks within F1 as to how serious GM's involvement was. Initially, the team had a deal to use Renault engines, and it appeared Cadillac was little more than a sponsorship deal.Andretti put forward its case for an entry through an official FIA process, but despite being accepted by the governing body in October 2023, they were rejected by F1 in January 2024, on the basis that they did not bring extra value to the sport.But Andretti parent group TWG refused to accept defeat. They reconfigured their bid. Michael Andretti was removed from the project, although father Mario, the 1978 F1 world champion, remains as an ambassador, and Cadillac's involvement was made more prominent, including taking on the name of the team.GM pledged to build its own engine - currently scheduled to appear in 2029 - and as it became clearer that Renault might pull out of F1, as it now has, a Ferrari customer deal was inked.A US department of justice investigation into F1's rejection of Andretti further greased the wheels, and the entry was finally confirmed in March last year.While all this was going on, Lowdon, formerly a senior figure at the Virgin/Manor/Marussia team that raced from 2009-16, was charged with setting up a new company from scratch. They had to commit to that long before the entry was confirmed, or they would simply have run out of time.Chief technical officer Nick Chester, technical director of Renault F1 from 2013-20 and subsequently the title-winning Mercedes Formula E team, was the second person to sign after Lowdon. He started in March 2023, and set to work on building up a 600-strong team at the same time as beginning to design a car.Now, Cadillac are occupying six buildings on the business park opposite the main entrance of Silverstone, and have two other bases, the GM technical centre in Warren, Michigan, and the GM Motorsport headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where drivers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Pérez have been working on the simulator.A new TWG headquarters in Fishers, Indiana, is due to be finished late this year, and will eventually become the F1 team's manufacturing centre, but the UK base at Silverstone will remain, albeit slimmed down to fewer buildings.\"You do need really good communications,\" says Lowdon, \"and we've got a massive necessity for peer-to-peer interaction. So we need engineers talking to engineers. We need an engineer here (at Silverstone) talking to an engineer in Charlotte and another one in Warren, Michigan, or eventually in Fishers.\"So we've looked to have a very, very flat management structure. It's highly modelled on the Apollo project. It's very similar. OK, we're not putting a man on the moon, but it feels like it sometimes.\"Lowdon and Cadillac F1 chief executive officer Dan Towriss, who has the same position at TWG, have been keen to emphasise the size of the task at hand, and their own sense of realism.\"We started with big dreams,\" Towriss says. \"We ran into a lot of obstacles and it was just a cacophony of voices that were telling us no. Not just no, but never.\"We've come at this incredibly complex, competitive time and we're jumping in from a standing start.\"We didn't buy an existing team. We didn't import a bunch of stuff. We started with nothing. So that's a pretty daunting challenge from that standpoint, which is why you heard a lot of people say it's going to be really hard.\"We know it's going to be really hard, but that's where that grit, that fight, that persistence comes.\"Cadillac have made no bones about the fact that they expect to finish last this year.\"Can you imagine if you've owned a Formula 1 team for 10 years and then another team rocks up and beats you?\" Lowdon says. \"You would be apoplectic. You would be so annoyed. And so you have to assume that any new team coming in is going to be last, you know, otherwise, you know, what's gone wrong somewhere else?\"They do indeed appear to be at the back. But Lowdon's words have been prescient. Aston Martin are in such dire straits that there is a significant question mark about which of the two will be slowest in Melbourne.The difference is, if it's Aston Martin, that is a desperate blow. If it's Cadillac, well, it's kind of part of the plan.\"We're up against teams who have been doing this for a very, very long time,\" Lowdon says. \"We're working through the programme. We've had no major issues, just small issues that I think every team in the paddock will have had before.\"We've got a lot of experienced people in the team. But the experience of working together as kind of like a Formula 1 team is less than 12 months.\"But I would say, to sum it up, extremely happy with the team. Very, very happy with the platform that we're building. And we can't wait for Melbourne.\"",

On the agenda was a full-throated defence of the administration’s record, hailing a \"turnaround for the ages,” whilst playing down the Supreme Court's ruling against his signature tariff policy (with the judges themselves in the crowd).\nDespite the speech lasting nearly two hours,  there was little to suggest a change of course from Trump’s favourite taking points. He focused on the economy, immigration, the Democrats…. And the US men’s olympic hockey team.\nBut with growing voter dissatisfaction souring the polls, will Trump’s sales pitch be enough to counter sliding approval ratings and convince voters to stick with him for November's midterm election?\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "31 minutes agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondent andJamie WhiteheadPA MediaIan Huntley is serving a life sentence for the murders of the two schoolgirlsSoham double murderer Ian Huntley remains in hospital in a serious condition after being attacked with a makeshift weapon by another inmate. The BBC understands that triple killer Anthony Russell, 43, is suspected of the attacking Huntley using a makeshift weapon.Huntley, 52, has suffered significant head trauma from his injuries and is undergoing treatment. He is serving a life sentence for murdering schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002.In an update on Friday, Durham Constabulary said there had been \"no change in the 52-year-old man's condition overnight - he remains in hospital in a serious condition\". Previously police said a male prisoner in his mid-40s suspected of carrying out the attack was \"in detention\" but had not been arrested \"at this stage\".The force also confirmed a police investigation is under way and that detectives are liaising with staff at the prison.Sources have told the BBC Huntley was found lying in a pool of blood after being bludgeoned with a make-shift weapon at a prison workshop at HMP Frankland - the high security prison in County Durham.Russell is serving a whole-life prison term for murdering Julie Williams, her son David Williams and Nicole McGregor, whose body was found in woodland near Leamington Spa.He had admitted the murders during a week-long spree in October 2020.This is not the first time Huntley has been attacked at the prison - he was slashed across the throat in 2010 - and needed 21 stiches. The prison is nicknamed monster mansion due to its extreme levels of violence. It houses some of the most dangerous criminals including murderers and rapists.Huntley was also attacked in 2005 by a convicted murderer who chucked boiling water over him at HMP Wakefield.As Huntley lies in hospital with serious injuries from the attack, many will be remembering the horror of what he did more than 20 years ago.In the commuter town of Soham in Cambridgeshire, Ian Huntley killed two ten-year-old girls in the summer of 2002.Holly and Jessica had been at a family barbeque. It is believed they were on their way to buy sweets when Huntley, then aged 28, lured them back to his home and killed them.The photo of the girls he killed - in their red Manchester United football kits - is etched in the minds of many who vividly remember their disappearance and murder.It was taken by Holly's mum Nicola just an hour-and-a-half before they were last seen. It dominated news reports at the time as a nationwide search for them took place.Four hundred officers worked full-time on the case. Hundreds more volunteers joined the search but nearly a fortnight after they disappeared – the girls' bodies were found in a ditch in Suffolk.Huntley was arrested the same day. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years for the double murders - with the judge saying \"in your lies and manipulation up to this very day, you have increased the suffering you have caused the two families\".His girlfriend Maxine Carr was also jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice for giving him a false alibi. She has since been released.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterReutersParty observers watch as votes are counted for the Gorton and Denton by-election at Manchester CentralGreater Manchester Police have told the BBC they have received \"no reports\" of electoral offences at the Gorton and Denton by-election.It comes after election observers raised concerns about \"extremely high\" levels of family voting.Family voting is where a family member is seen to be influencing somebody else's vote, for example by entering the polling booth with them. Concerns were raised by Democracy Volunteers, a group of voluntary election observers who check voting processes are being followed correctly.The by-election's acting returning officer said polling station staff were trained to look for undue influence on voters and \"no such issues\" had been reported during polling hours.Family voting was effectively made illegal through the Ballot Secrecy Act 2023, which made it a criminal offence to be in or near a polling booth with another person in order to influence them to vote in a particular way.Democracy Volunteers director John Ault issued a statement after polls had closed on Thursday, saying observers had seen \"the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10 year history of observing elections in the UK\".He said: \"We rarely issue a report on the night of an election, but the data we have collected today on family voting, when compared to other recent by-elections, is extremely high.\"In the other recent Westminster parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby we saw family voting in 12% of polling stations, affecting 1% of voters. \"In Gorton and Denton, we observed family voting in 68% of polling stations, affecting 12% of those voters observed.\"The group said four observers attended 22 of the 45 polling stations in the constituency, spending 30 to 45 minutes in each.Of the 22 polling stations observed, volunteers reported potential family voting in 15.They observed a sample of 545 individuals casting their vote and saw 32 cases of family voting in total, including nine cases in one polling station.The officer responsible for running the by-election rejected the claims, saying no reports of family voting had been made by polling station staff.A spokesperson for the acting returning officer said: \"Polling station staff are trained to look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters. \"No such issues have been reported today.\"If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken. \"We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police - who had a presence at every polling station - where necessary.\"It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.\"A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections in the UK, said: \"We are aware of the report. Electoral offences are a matter for the police. We encourage anyone who believes an offence has occurred to report it to the police.\"The statutory electoral observer Code of Practice says that electoral observers may bring potential irregularities, fraud or significant problems to the attention of elected officials on the spot.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said in an X post that reports of high levels of family voting were \"deeply concerning\" and raised questions \"about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas\".His party's chairman David Bull told BBC Radio 4 family voting was \"illegal\" but when asked if it made a difference to the election result, he said \"probably not\".The Green Party hit back at Reform's critcisms, with a spokesman saying: \"This is an attempt to undermine the democratic result and is straight out of the Trump playbook.\"We've just won a historic by-election by a comfortable margin.\"We've shown the country that Greens can beat Reform, despite their big business donations.\"Gorton and Denton by-electionLabour Party chair Anna Turley told BBC Newsnight reports of family voting in the Gorton and Denton by-election are \"extremely worrying and concerning\". \"That's not what we want to see in our democracy,\" she said. \"So obviously we need to see the evidence and the report, and then make due decision about what authorities should look into this.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski told BBC Breakfast if any wrongdoing had happened there should be an investigation, but pointed to Manchester City Council's statement saying no issues had been reported.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the claims raised questions \"about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas\", saying the election was \"a victory for sectarian voting and cheating\".The party's chair David Bull acknowledged the practice probably did not affect the final result but \"we need to ensure this doesn't happen\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandOsmond Chia,Business reporterGetty ImagesElectronics appliance maker Dyson has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed against it by 24 migrant workers, who alleged they were subjected to forced and abusive treatment in a Malaysian factory making the firm's parts.The workers, from Nepal and Bangladesh, sued the firm in 2022 and described being subject to what amounted to modern day slavery.Dyson has denied any liability. When the case was brought it said it had been previously unaware of the alleged abuses, and the Malaysia supplier should be held responsible instead.The case is significant for establishing the precedent that allegations against foreign companies supplying British manufacturers can be judged in an English court.The workers described being threatened and beaten, having their passports withheld, and being forced to work long hours in unsanitary conditions.According to their lawyers, from Leigh Day, they were denied toilet breaks and forced to work \"upwards of 12 hours at a time without relieving themselves\".Under the terms of the settlement the details of any compensation to the workers are not being disclosed.In separate but almost identical statements posted on their websites, Dyson and Leigh Day said the resolution was reached \"in recognition of the expenses of litigation and the benefits of settlement\".They both also said the settlement was not an admission of liability on Dyson's part.The company had earlier argued that the case should be heard in Malaysia, not Britain.But the Supreme Court agreed that the trial could take place in an English court, setting a precedent that British companies can be held to account in the UK for actions taken by suppliers in another country.Labour activists have for many years drawn attention to the problem of abuses of the large migrant worker population in Malaysia.Dyson, popular for its line of premium hair dryers and home appliances, moved its manufacturing from the UK to Malaysia in 2002.The Airwrap maker moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2019.",

    "body": "From plumber to Parliament: the Green Party's new MP10 minutes agoRichard Wheeler,political reporterandJoe Pike,political correspondentPA MediaFrom plumber to parliamentarian, Hannah Spencer will arrive in the House of Commons as the Green Party's first ever Westminster by-election winner.The 34-year-old marked her victory in Gorton and Denton, Greater Manchester, with an apology to her customers, saying: \"I think I might have to cancel the work that you had booked in, because I'm heading to Parliament.\"And when I get there, I will make space for everyone doing jobs like mine, we will finally get a seat at the table.\"Spencer also describes herself and her new constituents as those who \"work hard\".But she warned \"working hard used to get you something\" as she outlined her desire to help those people who are struggling with the cost of living.Spencer said: \"Instead of working for a nice life, we're working to line the pockets of billionaires. We are being bled dry.\"And I don't think it's extreme or radical to think working hard should get you a nice life. And I don't think that if you're not able to work that you should still have a nice life. I think that absolutely everybody should get a nice life.\"Palestinian flags featured on Spencer's leaflets and she made clear during the campaign that she believed a \"genocide\" was taking place in Gaza.Spencer, who used a campaign video to say she spends her \"life fixing things that are broken\", also said she wanted to end privatisation in the NHS and nationalise water companies.Spencer worked as a plumber after leaving education aged 16, and started 2026 with the ambition of \"new year, new trade\".She explained she had returned to college to start a full-time plastering course, but within weeks she was combining this training - commuting by car to a college in Stoke - with her campaigning efforts in Gorton and Denton.Spencer posted on LinkedIn about how she had \"slowly taught myself and done bits\" of plastering in recent years, but had signed-up for an intensive course to ensure she could \"cover more parts of a project\".Spencer added: \"Plus, I just really love trying something new and not stopping until I crack it.\"ReutersHannah Spencer and Green Party leader Zack Polanski believe the party will make more electoral gainsWhile Spencer noted in her victory speech that she \"didn't grow up wanting to be a politician\", the House of Commons will not be Spencer's first experience of working in politics.She currently leads the Greens on Trafford Council, where she has represented the Hale ward since May 2023. Spencer also stood as the Green Party's mayoral election candidate for Greater Manchester in 2024.Now she'll be the Green Party's fifth MP, sitting alongside Siân Berry, Adrian Ramsay, Carla Denyer and Ellie Chowns.'Hugely blighted'When announced as the party's by-election candidate, the Green Party highlighted Bolton-born Spencer's ties to the area and how she has \"lived in Greater Manchester all her life\".Spencer, regarded as straight-talking and authentic, once wrote that she was \"glad\" to move out of Gorton and Denton.During the campaign, media attention focused on a post by her on Mumsnet in 2021 in which she said Levenshulme has been \"hugely blighted\" by \"(supposedly) money laundering takeaways\" and that independent businesses \"can't get a look in\".The Greens responded by saying the post made clear Spencer's \"affection\" for the area and her \"disappointment\" that independent businesses were being crowded out.Spencer also describes herself as a marathon runner and \"housemate to four rescued greyhounds\", with the dogs spotted campaigning with her in the constituency.PA MediaSpencer describes herself as \"housemate to four rescued greyhounds\"In the aftermath of her victory, Spencer said \"this is only the beginning\" for the Greens.She told a press conference: \"This was number 127 on the list of Green Party target seats. There are at least 126 seats where we can win with a smaller swing than we saw here, but actually we can win anywhere.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski added: \"What happened last night is despite the fact that the other parties threw the kitchen sink at us, we had Hannah the plumber.\"And ultimately Hannah has demonstrated the complete opposite. You can be absolutely true to your values and you must be true to your values.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorEPALabour's deputy leader Lucy Powell spoke to reporters before the result was announced in Gorton and DentonNever before have the Green Party won a Westminster by-election.So this is a result that will take its place in the history of parliamentary contests between elections.And it will prompt yet more soul searching within the Labour Party: finishing third was the nightmare result for them.It makes real the long-standing fear of some in the party that they would face an insurgency not just broadly from the Right, in the shape of Reform UK, but from the Left as well, in the form of the Green Party.In Gorton and Denton, that is precisely what has happened.The prime minister will wake up with both a tactical and a strategic question in his mind.Firstly, should he have allowed the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, to be Labour's candidate? His supporters in the count centre told me they do think he would have made a significant difference.And secondly, has Labour's focus on Reform UK left them exposed among some of their regular supporters?At the 2024 general election, Labour won with a majority of more than 13,000 in Gorton and Denton and secured more than 50% of the vote.The inquest for some Labour MPs began in the middle of the night.\"Keir needs to own this. He's out of chances,\" one texted me.\"Everyone knew the only chance to beat both the Greens and Reform was Andy Burnham. You can't claim to be the party of unity when you're adopting the divisive policies of Reform. Vote Labour to stop Reform rings hollow when you're mimicking them.\"Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell made a dash for it immediately after the declaration; reporters, me included, chasing after her shouting questions.She had, to be fair, done a few interviews before the result was confirmed, but after it looked clear Labour was doomed.Reform's candidate Matt Goodwin did talk to journalists afterwards, branding the Green Party \"mad\" and claiming that, unlike Reform, they wouldn't be able to replicate this in many places at a general election.The Green Party is delighted. I grabbed a quick word with their relatively new leader, Zack Polanski, just moments after the polls closed, and he wore the smile and demeanour of a confident leader.He can now point to a result that suggests the party's buoyant opinion poll ratings since he became leader have some substance to them. We can expect a victory rally with him and his new MP Hannah Spencer later this morning.And if you are looking for further evidence that politics is fracturing, unpredictable and wildly competitive, take a look at how the Conservatives fared.The Tories managed just 706 votes - 1.9% of the votes cast - for a party that was running the country just two years ago.A final thought that will be part of the conversation in the hours and days after this by election – the suggestion of significant \"family voting\" as it is known.The group Democracy Volunteers reported what it called \"concerningly high levels of family voting in Gorton and Denton\" - which it defines as \"where two voters either confer, collude or direct each other on voting\".Manchester City Council insisted \"no such issues\" were reported by its staff at polling stations.Labour Party Chair Anna Turley told the BBC the reports were \"obviously extremely worrying and concerning\" and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed the by-election was \"a victory for sectarian voting and cheating\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesScientists have said mackerel supplies in the north-east Atlantic have fallen into a danger zoneWaitrose is to suspend sales of mackerel products due to concerns about overfishing.The supermarket said it would stop sourcing fresh, chilled and frozen mackerel by 29 April, as well as tinned mackerel once the current stock sells out.Marine groups have recommended a cut in the amount of North East Atlantic mackerel being caught to prevent a collapse in stocks.Waitrose said it was the first UK supermarket to suspend mackerel sales, adding it would only start restocking the fish \"once it meets our high sourcing standards\".In September, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) recommended that catches should be cut by 70% to allow the fish to reproduce.In December, the UK, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland agreed to cut mackerel catches by 48%, but Waitrose said this was not enough.All Waitrose mackerel is sourced from Scottish waters.The grocery chain said that from May 2026, North East Atlantic mackerel would no longer meet its own responsible sourcing requirements.Jake Pickering, head of agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries at Waitrose, said: \"By suspending sourcing of mackerel at Waitrose we are reinforcing our ethical and sustainable business commitments, acting to tackle overfishing and protect the long-term health of our oceans and this crucial fish.\"Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, said it would replace its mackerel products with \"responsibly sourced\" alternatives in order to \"make a stand against overfishing and support long-term health and sustainability of fish stocks\".All of the new products are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified.Last year, the Marine Conservation Society said mackerel was \"under immense pressure from fishing activities across multiple nations, and the stock will soon be no longer able to sustain itself\".The society welcomed Waitrose's announcement. Kerry Lyne, its Good Fish Guide manager, said: \"To keep favourites like mackerel on the menu, we need support right across the supply chain with fishing kept within sustainable limits.\"Charles Clover, co-founder of conservation charity Blue Marine Foundation, said overfishing was a \"crisis\" that has been \"ignored for too long\". \"The plight of the mackerel is part of a wider failure to take scientific advice intended to keep stocks healthy and able to recover from fishing pressure.\"We hope that this action by Waitrose sends it to the top of the political agenda,\" he said.\"Last year more than half of UK catch limits were set above sustainable levels.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentBBC/Shine TVFormer MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace has abandoned his legal claim against the BBC and will not be receiving any payment in costs or damages.Wallace had been seeking up to £10,000 in damages from the BBC, but court documents state the claim against the BBC and BBC Studios has been \"discontinued\".The former presenter had claimed the broadcaster caused him \"distress and harassment\" by failing to comply with a request for copies of his personal data.Wallace was taking legal action against the BBC and BBC Studios after being sacked from the cooking show in July.His dismissal followed a report that upheld more than 40 allegations about his conduct on MasterChef, including one of unwelcome physical contact and three of being in a state of undress.Wallace previously said he was \"deeply sorry for any distress\" he caused and that he \"never set out to harm or humiliate\".The BBC had said Gregg Wallace was not \"entitled to any damages\", in response to his legal claim.In its defence filed at the High Court in October, the BBC said it denied that he \"has suffered any distress or harassment\" as a result of its responses to his requests.It also argued that Wallace pursued his claim without giving it prior notice, and added that the BBC provided him with a copy of the personal data to which it says he was entitled on 7 October.On Friday, the BBC said: \"Shortly in advance of a hearing (due 16 February), Mr Wallace discontinued his claim. He is not receiving any payment in costs or damages from either BBC or BBC Studios.\"Wallace's representatives have been approached for a comment.BBC News is editorially independent from the wider corporation.Upheld complaintsGreg Wallace hosted MasterChef for 20 years, but stepped away from presenting the show last year after facing a string of misconduct claims, first revealed by BBC News.The show's production company Banijay ordered an inquiry, which heard 83 allegations against the TV presenter.Of those, 45 were upheld, including one of unwelcome physical contact and three of being in a state of undress. Most related to inappropriate sexual language and humour, and also culturally insensitive or racist comments.In response, he said he was \"deeply sorry for any distress\" he caused and that he \"never set out to harm or humiliate\", but that \"none of the serious allegations against me were upheld\".A separate claim that his co-host John Torode had used a severely offensive racist term was also substantiated. Torode has said he has \"no recollection\" of the incident.Both presenters were sacked in July.In September, it was revealed that food critic Grace Dent and chef Anna Haugh are the new hosts of MasterChef.",

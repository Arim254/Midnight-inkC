Has Donald Trump changed his mind on the Epstein Files?AmericastAvailable for over a yearOn Sunday night Donald Trump told Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote in favour of releasing files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “because we have nothing to hide”. It’s a striking change in position from the president who has so far resisted pressure from Democrats and Republicans in his own party who have been demanding that all files relating to Epstein be released into the public domain. \nOne of the Republicans calling for their release is the conservative firebrand and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once one of Trump’s most faithful supporters. After stepping up her demands to see the files released, she now appears to have lost the president’s backing who called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party. We answer your questions on why the pair have fallen out.\nAnd, we answer your questions on why there’s been another presidential pardon, this time for the UK billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

    "body": "Hewlett Packard (HP) is seeking $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from the estate of Mike Lynch - who died last year when his yacht sank - over HP's acquisition of his firm Autonomy, the tech giant's lawyers have told the High Court.HP, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), bought Mr Lynch's tech firm Autonomy in 2011, but it says Mr Lynch and Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, misrepresented the company's finances.In a 2019 trial, HPE had accused Mr Lynch of inflating Autonomy's revenues which it said forced it to announce an $8.8bn write-down of the company's worth.Mr Justice Hildyard ruled in 2022 that HPE had \"substantially succeeded\" in its claim, but that it was likely to receive \"substantially less\" than the $5bn it sought in damages.Earlier this year, he ruled that HPE suffered losses amounting to around £700m through the purchase of Autonomy.Mr Lynch and his teenage daughter Hannah were among seven passengers and crew who died when the Bayesian went down off the coast of Sicily last August during a storm which caused the vessel to capsize and sink.A hearing in London, which began on Tuesday, will now decide whether Mr Lynch's estate can appeal against the 2022 and 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Patrick Goodall, the barrister representing HPE, argued that Mr Lynch's estate was liable to pay $1.7bn, which includes around $761m in interest.He said that Mr Lynch had \"not only perpetrated an enormous fraud, but lied about it at every stage\".He said the claimants had spent almost £150m on the legal battle, and were seeking nearly £113m of their costs from Mr Lynch's estate.Mr Goodall also said that Mr Lynch's estate should not be allowed to appeal against either the 2022 or 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Richard Hill, the lawyer representing Mr Lynch's estate, said that the $761m in interest sought by the claimants was an \"excessive sum... based on a flawed analysis\" and that the \"legally and economically rational approach would provide for a materially lower figure\".The claimants' position that \"they were the victors in this litigation\" was \"overly simplistic\", he added.Mr Hill also said that Mr Lynch's estate should be allowed to appeal against the two earlier rulings, claiming that the judge \"erred in law\" and that there was a \"compelling reason for allowing the appeal to be heard\".A spokesperson for the Lynch family said: \"Today's hearing addresses technical matters that change nothing about the underlying substance of the case.\"The core facts remain that HP's claim was fundamentally flawed and a wild overstatement.\"In a separate case, Mr Lynch was extradited to the US in 2023 to face criminal charges, and he was cleared of fraud charges in 2024.He was celebrating being acquitted on his yacht when it sank.",

    "body": "Nine people have been killed and dozens more wounded in a Russian attack on the western city of Ternopil, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Nine-storey blocks of flats were hit in the strikes, as Russia fired more than 470 drones and 47 missiles at Ukraine overnight in a \"brazen attack\", Zelensky said.Three districts of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, were also hit by a massive drone attack which injured more than 30 people, including children. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze. Power cuts are affecting a number of regions across the country, Ukraine's energy ministry said.The attack early on Wednesday was one of the deadliest on western Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.Zelensky said there had been \"significant destruction\" in Ternopil, adding that people could be trapped under the rubble. Energy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine.The energy sector in Ivano-Frankivsk region was also attacked, and two of the three injured were children. Critical infrastructure and energy were hit in the Lviv region, Zelensky said, while the head of the region said a energy facility had been struck. Zelensky, who is in Turkey for talks with his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for aid from Ukraine's allies, writing: \"Every brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient. Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this.\" Ukraine's president had said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations ahead of the meeting in Ankara, but the Kremlin said no Russian representative would join.

    "body": "10 hours agoSam Hancock and Hugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  ReutersAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli strike near a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, the country's health ministry says.The Israeli military said it had targeted members of the Palestinian armed group Hamas \"operating in a training compound... in the Ein el-Hilweh area\". It said the location was used by Hamas to plan and carry out attacks against Israel, which Hamas rejected as \"fabrication and lies\".Israel has carried out regular air strikes on people and places in Lebanon since a deal to end the conflict with the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Most strikes have targeted Hezbollah but Israel has also attacked Hamas in the country.As well as those killed, Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people had been injured in the strike.Images showed emergency workers at the entrance of Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.Footage online also showed ambulances rushing through the narrow streets of the crowded camp as a huge plume of smoke billowed from the location hit.Initial reports said the strike hit an area outside a mosque that is usually busy at night. Condemning the attack, Hamas said it had \"no military installations in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon\" and that the site targeted was an \"open sports field\".In its statement, the IDF said \"prior to the strike, measures were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information\".Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has killed at least 69,169 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the Lebanese group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months that culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October 2024.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoSeveral of Wednesday's papers are leading on Chinese espionage in the UK, after MI5 issued an alert to MPs. The Times reports on an alert to MPs issued by MI5 identifying two LinkedIn profiles which it says have been used on behalf of the Chinese state to recruit. US President Donald Trump and the Crown Prince of Saudia Arabia Mohammed bin Salman are pictured clasping hands at the White House on the front page.The Guardian says the LinkedIn profiles in question were designed as a \"covert and calculated\" attempt to recruit parliamentarians and obtain \"non-public and insider insights\". It says that the profiles were under the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen. The Independent says a \"new row\" has erupted between London and Beijing after the MI5 alert to British politicians. It reports the Chinese embassy in the UK dismissing the accusations as \"pure fabrication and malicious slander\".As well as the MI5 story, the Financial Times front pages also features Trump and the crown prince prominently. It says the president lashed out at a reporter who asked about the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime who was murdered at the country's Istanbul embassy in 2018. Trump said his White House guest \"new nothing about\" the killing, seemingly contradicting the assessment of US intelligence agencies.The Telegraph says Britain is \"not ready to defend\" itself against an invasion. After a year-long inquiry, the Commons defence committee accused the government of moving at a \"glacial\" pace in the face of renewed threats from Russia and China. Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured on the paper's front page following her first public speech in more than two years.The i newspaper claims Chancellor Rachel Reeves told a meeting of Labour MPs that a tax on high-value properties will be included in her Budget next week. The chancellor urged MPs to \"sell the message\" that new tax rises will fall hardest on wealthy people, according to the paper.Both the Mirror and Guardian carry claims by former schoolmates of Nigel Farage who say the Reform UK leader held \"racist and antisemitic\" views while a teenager. The party says the allegations are \"entirely without foundation\" and a \"smear\".The Metro leads on comments made by Google boss Sundar Pichai to BBC News. He told the BBC that people should not \"blindly trust\" AI models, which he said were prone to errors.The Mail leads on an investigation into the death of teacher John Wright. The paper claims he took his own life after being sacked by an elite private school for making what the Mail describes as a \"few ill-advised remarks\". Marlborough College has insisted he was dismissed for \"inappropriate conduct\".The Express says asylum seekers have been filmed \"partying and fighting\" at their temporary accommodation at a Ministry of Defence site in Essex. It calls the scenes \"raving mad\".Finally, the Daily Star leads on the news that the BBC's beloved crime drama Line of Duty is making a sensational comeback. Photos of a jubilant Scotland squad celebrating their World Cup qualifying win appear across the front and back pages. After 27 years, the Scottish Daily Mail says, \"Scots are finally on top of the world\". According to the Scotland edition of the Times, \"the roof nearly came off the stadium\" at the final whistle - while the Sun declares: \"Scotland are back.\"The i Paper reports that suspected Chinese spies operating profiles on the networking site LinkedIn are connected to senior officials within the Home Office, the Foreign Office and Nato. After a warning from MI5 that those involved in politics were being targeted by China, a senior government figure tells the Times that they are sending a \"clear message to Beijing that we know what you are doing\". But the Financial Times says the dispute \"threatens to strain further a relationship that Sir Keir Starmer has tried to improve\".A report which says the UK is under-prepared for an armed attack is highlighted on the front page of the Daily Telegraph. The paper quotes the Commons' defence committee as saying that the government is moving at a \"glacial\" pace in the face of \"renewed threats from Russia and China\". The Ministry of Defence says it will set out its plans to bolster the UK's \"warfighting readiness\" later on Wednesday.\"Farage told me 'Hitler was right'\" is the headline in the Daily Mirror. It quotes a former classmate of Nigel Farage as saying he recalls him using racist taunts at school. The story originates in the Guardian, which says it has heard from more than a dozen people who accuse the Reform UK leader of \"deeply offensive behaviour\" throughout his teenage years.In legal letters to the paper, Farage emphatically denies saying anything racist or antisemitic when he was a teenager. Reform UK says the allegations are \"entirely without foundation\", describing them as \"cynical attempts\" to smear the party and mislead the public.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "8 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsGettyThe researchers found evidence of kissing in multiple species Humans do it, monkeys do it, even polar bears do it. And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing. Their study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in.The same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another.The scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom. GettyThe scientists defined a kiss as mouth-on-mouth contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\"By finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an \"evolutionary family tree\" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved.To ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a \"kiss\". In their study, published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\".\"Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,\" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, \"it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed.\"\"We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes.\"In this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses. They focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss. The same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed. One previous piece of research on Neanderthal DNA also showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva. \"That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,\" explained Dr Brindle.        GettyThe scientists say this behaviour is something 'we share with our non-human relatives'While this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why. There are already a number of theories - that it arose from grooming behaviour in our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way to assess the health and even the compatibility of a partner. Dr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question. \"It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,\" she said.\"We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.\"     ",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterMinistry of DefenceThe UK lacks a plan to defend itself and overseas territories from a military attack, a report by MPs has found.In a highly critical assessment, the defence committee said the UK is \"nowhere near\" where it needs to be to defend itself and allies, especially at a time when security threats to Europe are \"significant\".The report found that the UK is failing to meet its Nato obligations, and falling \"far short of its claimed leadership position\".The highly critical report was published as the Ministry of Defence (MoD) identified prospective locations for six new munitions factories, part of a strategy to ramp up domestic defence production. In June, Defence Secretary John Healey announced plans to move the UK to \"war-fighting readiness,\" including £1.5bn to support the construction of new munitions factories, which will be built by private contractors.But after an 11-month inquiry, the defence committee warned the UK and its European Nato allies remained too reliant on the US and is not spending enough on its own defences.Committee chair Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi said: \"Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, unrelenting disinformation campaigns, and repeated incursions into European airspace mean that we cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand.\"He said the committee had \"repeatedly heard concerns about the UK's ability to defend itself from attack\". The specific recommendations of the committee's report included a call for the government to accelerate the speed of industrial change, and make \"readiness\" a key objective.Europe's heavy reliance on the US in critical areas such as \"intel, satellites, transportation of troops and air-to-air refuelling\" was also subject to critique in the report.It noted that the UK had \"next to nothing\" when it came to integrated air and missile defences, and pointed to recent drones encroaching on airspace across Europe as a way new technologies can threaten civilian populations in addition to military targets. The report was also particularly critical of what it calls the \"glacial pace\" of promised improvements to civil defence and resilience, saying the UK may be failing to meet its Nato Article 3 obligations to \"maintain and develop individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack\".Dhesi says the government also needed to deliver on its promise to better communicate with the public about \"the level of threat we face and what to expect in the event of conflict\".\"Wars aren't won just by generals, but by the whole of the population getting behind the Armed Forces and playing our part,\" he added. The government announced earlier this year that UK defence spending would rise to 3% of GDP by 2034 at the latest.In a speech on Wednesday, Healey is expected to announce plans to restart the production of energetics - explosives, pyrotechnics and propellants - in the UK, after two decades of sourcing these materials from overseas.The MoD is scoping out 13 sites where it believes the new factories could be built and has named the areas of the UK where they are located.There are three potential sites in Scotland - in Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire and at Grangemouth, in Stirlingshire.In England, a total of eight sites have been earmarked - in Teesside, Cumbria, Shropshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Essex, Worcestershire and Hampshire - and there are two in Wales - in Monmouthshire and Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire.The government wants at least six new factories to be operational by the next election in 2029, and hopes work will begin on the first of these next year.Healey is also expected to announce the opening of two new drone factories this week in Plymouth and Swindon.\"We are making defence an engine for growth, unambiguously backing British jobs and British skills as we make the UK better ready to fight and better able to deter future conflicts,\" the defence secretary will say.\"This is the path that delivers national and economic security.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoChris Mason,Political editor and Georgia Roberts,Political correspondentWhen MPs, members of the House of Lords and their staff were warned about the threat from Chinese spies, in one office in Westminster, a quick check began.Simon Whelband is a Conservative councillor and also works for the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, who was sanctioned by China in 2021.Simon went into his LinkedIn messages and there it was. A message from an account in the name of Shirly Shen sent some weeks earlier.He hadn't responded to the unsolicited message and reported it to Parliament's security services. He was then advised to block the account.The note comes across as pretty innocuous.He said: \"The message wasn't written in very good English, it was a message to say there was a job opportunity and was I interested, and to get in touch if I was. \"I've worked around Parliament for about 10 years now so I'm kind of used to this.\"But if you were more junior, you don't know what you're looking for. \"You might think it's a genuine offer that's made to you on LinkedIn, they might accept.\"Whelband added that he thought it was becoming more common for those working in Parliament to be targeted by China.\"They have realised the way to get to Parliamentarians is through their staff... it's deeply worrying,\" he said.And so, for the second time this autumn, Westminster is collectively wrestling with what to do about China.The growing influence of this vast superpower is one of the two stand out global changes of the last 30 years, alongside the growth of the internet. Some of the most acute challenges - or threats - from Beijing come when both of these mega-trends of the early 21st Century combine.Senior figures in government are worried, but express their worry carefully in public. MPs outside of government are much more willing to be blunt.Tuesday's debate in the Commons on this was an eye opener. The security minister Dan Jarvis was both circumspect in his language, but warm and accepting of the wide range of concerns expressed by MPs of multiple parties.Among them:Concern that buses manufactured in China but driving on British streets might be equipped with a so-called \"kill switch\" which allows someone in China to press a button and disable the bus – potentially causing chaosWorries about vehicles used by the military that are made in China and might be mobile listening devices – to such an extent that military figures have been warned to watch what they are saying when they are on board in case China is listeningDeep concern about China seeking planning permission for a huge new embassy in central London which critics say will be a spying centre and is located very close to sensitive data cables that serve the City of LondonLast month, Parliament was digesting the collapse of a court case involving two men accused of spying for China, one of whom had worked in Westminster. Both men always denied any wrongdoing. Now it is the warning that all MPs and members of the House of Lords have received from the security service MI5 that they might be Beijing's next target.It says it has identified two LinkedIn profiles used by Chinese security services to act as \"civilian recruitment headhunters\", targeting individuals working in British politics to solicit \"insider insights\".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, circulated the warning to MPs and peers on Tuesday.The alert specifically identified two LinkedIn profiles set up with the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen.The BBC has contacted both for a response, although it is not clear if the women named and pictured on the networking site are the actual account holders.As Jarvis put it, China \"has a low threshold for information it regards as valuable\". This is because over time it builds up a wider picture by piecing together the morsels it may extract from a wide range of people.Labour, since they won the general election, have attempted to warm up the UK's relationship with China.The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been to Beijing, as has the Business Secretary Peter Kyle, who was there in September within days of being appointed to the role. The most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office, Sir Olly Robbins, was there last month in the midst of all those headlines about the collapsed spying trial.But there has long been a vociferous collection of China hawks in Parliament, who have long worried about what they see as a collective naivety about Beijing. The question now is whether a moment like this, following MI5's intervention, persuades others to share their outlook.The government insists its approach to China is \"pragmatic\": it regards working with Beijing as inevitable but insists it is \"clear eyed\" about the risks.Will a growing number of MPs demand a more sceptical outlook?As one put it, rather colourfully, \"you can't reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth\".China is a vast superpower that is at once essential yet awkward, unavoidable yet dangerous.This the latest case study in those competing interests. There will be more to come.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.Hanan Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi's widow, speaks to BBC after Trump defends Saudi crown princeReacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence of the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her husband's murder.\"The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and hold responsibility about this horrible crime,\" she said.In a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with compensation for her husband's murder.Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also present at the dinner. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "Travel disruption is likely for some parts of the UK as a cold snap continues and some areas wake to snowy and icy conditions on Wednesday.Multiple Met Office yellow warnings are in force for snow and ice on Wednesday, with a more severe amber warning also issued for Thursday.With cold arctic air across the UK, there are also yellow and amber cold-health alerts from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) until Saturday.Risks of snow and ice diminish by the weekend as it turns less cold.An area of rain, sleet and snow moved across the UK overnight into Wednesday morning, leading to some icy patches and some areas waking up to a covering of snow.The Met Office said \"overnight ice could create some particularly tricky travel conditions\". The agency has warned that the wintry weather makes driving conditions dangerous, adding that road closures are possible which could leave some vehicles and passengers stranded.Darren Clark, a severe weather resilience advisor for National Highways - which looks after England's major roads - has urged all drivers to do \"quick checks\" such as checking lights and tyres so as to \"not be caught out\".He added that there are more than 530 gritters available to be called on \"when snow hits or conditions demand it\".National Highways is working closely with the Met Office, which has told all drivers to ensure their vehicles are packed with essentials - such as food, clothing and a torch - in the event of any delays.Bus and train service delays and cancellations are also possible.Travellers are advised to plan their route, check for any delays, closures or cancellations, and give themselves ample time to prepare and travel.Hills of Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland are forecast to see around 2-5cm (0.8-2in) of accumulating snow, with more on higher ground.Through Wednesday, parts of south west Wales and south west England will continue to see wintry showers move through, with potential for some disruption due to settling snow over high ground.There is a risk of some ice on Wednesday too, so there are multiple yellow Met Office weather warnings in force across the UK.Frequent snow showers will continue in northern and eastern Scotland and north east England throughout Wednesday and into Thursday.Met Office yellow warnings - valid until 23:59 GMT on Thursday - suggest 2-5cm at low levels, but around 15-20cm of snow is possible over 300m.The North York Moors and even parts of the Yorkshire Wolds could potentially get up to 25cm by Thursday.It is here where a more severe Met Office amber warning will come into force from 05:00 to 21:00 GMT on Thursday.This is likely to cause \"substantial disruption\" with rural communities being cut off, vehicles becoming stranded and potential for power cuts.Gusty winds leading to blizzards and thunderstorms - thundersnow - may bring additional hazards.Wednesday will feel particularly cold with a strong northerly wind.While temperatures will range from 1-7C, the wind chill will make it feel even colder, especially in eastern parts of the UK.Yellow cold-health alerts from the UKHSA are in force across the Midlands until 08:00 GMT Saturday.More severe amber alerts have been issued for North West, North East, Yorkshire and Humber for the same period.These alerts are mainly for health and social care services, warning of \"significant\" impacts to more vulnerable members of the community.Extra demands may be put on services to deal with the colder weather.Colder weather can lead to excess deaths, particularly for those over 65 or those with health conditions. The UKHSA also warns there may be impacts to some younger age groups too.Thursday night will be the coldest night this week with temperatures widely falling below zero and down to -12C in rural Scotland.By Friday and the weekend, it will become less cold as the weather shifts more to an Atlantic influence bringing more cloud and bit of rain and less-cold air.Temperatures by Saturday will rise slightly to average.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna Faguyon Capitol HillGetty ImagesBoth chambers of  Congress agreed to order the US justice department to release its files on sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the measure in a 427-1 vote and the Senate unanimously fast-tracked it without a formal vote. The moves come just days after President Donald Trump reversed his position and urged Congress to vote to disclose the records following public pushback from many of his supporters. Last week, Trump and his ties to Epstein were thrust back into the headlines after more than 20,000 pages of documents - some mentioning the president - were released. The White House denied any wrongdoing.Republican Clay Higgins, of Louisiana, was the sole House objector and cited his concern about “innocent people being hurt” with the release of the information. Trump’s reversal from attacking those on Capitol Hill who wanted the files released to saying there was “nothing to hide” surprised some in Washington. The Republican congressional leadership was caught off guard after aligning their message with the president for the past few weeks and opposing the release. House Speaker Mike Johnson had repeatedly called the push to release the Epstein files a \"Democrat hoax\". On Tuesday, he voted in support of release. What do we know about the Epstein files?Epstein saga reveals Republican rifts - and the power of Trump's baseThe only 'no' vote on releasing Epstein filesThe measure had been expected to take a few days to reach the US Senate, but after the resounding afternoon vote in the House, the timeline quickly sped up. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought up the bill on the floor of the Senate under a procedure called unanimous consent. Because no one objected, there was no debate and no amendments added to the bill. It will head from the Senate to the president‘s desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.A congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own.The bill requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted.Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs and people and entities connected to Epstein. But the bill also gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identifies any victims. Epstein, a financier, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. During two criminal investigations into Epstein, thousands of documents were gathered, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses. Trump and Epstein previously socialised in similar circles, but the president said he cut ties with Epstein many years ago, before his 2008 conviction. The president also said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity. Last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email chains, including correspondence between Epstein and Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.Some of those make mention of Trump, including one email, sent in 2011, in which Epstein wrote to Maxwell: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.” The White House said last week that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.‘She did it’: Virginia Giuffre’s family speaks to BBC after Congress approves release of Epstein filesGiuffre, who died in April, said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump in the emails.Speaking after the vote, Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts praised her sister's role in seeking justice for Epstein survivors.\"She did it, she paved the way... She paved the way for us to come forward as advocates, for her survivor sisters to come forward, and we won't stop,\" Roberts said.Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".The push for the release of the investigative files held by the Department of Justice was led by Republican Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who sometimes dissents from his party, and Democrat Ro Khanna, a California congressman, both of whom introduced the legislation.Massie has faced criticism from Trump for his push to release the files, but has stood firm. “In 2030, he’s not going to be the president,” Massie said to ABC News over the weekend. He added that fellow Republicans who voted against release \"will have voted to protect paedophiles”. Another Republican who has pushed for the release of the files is House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. She had been a staunch supporter of Trump before the two fell out over the issue, with the president now calling her a \"traitor\". At a news conference earlier in the day on Tuesday, Greene said she is speaking up on behalf of Epstein's survivors. She also called out Trump directly.\"Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves; a patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women standing behind me,\" Greene said.She said that row over Epstein has been one of the \"most destructive things\" to Trump's Make America Great Again movement since his election in 2016. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse also spoke at the news conference, urging lawmakers to release the files and pushing Trump to do the same.Epstein survivor Annie Farmer said that keeping the files under wraps amounted to “institutional betrayal”. “Because these crimes were not properly investigated, so many more girls and women were harmed,” Ms Farmer said.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKayla EpsteinWatch: US Senate unanimously agrees to pass bill to release Epstein filesAfter Congress voted to force the justice department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, the legislation will now move to President Donald Trump's desk.And if Trump does sign it into law as expected, it will mark the final action in what has been a remarkable and abrupt change in his position.For months, Trump was dismissive of calls to release the government's full trove of documents about the late financier and convicted sex offender. He described the case in July as \"pretty boring stuff\".That was until Sunday, when - with a snowballing number of Republicans in the House signalling they would vote to release them - the president relented and encouraged them to do so. His shift opened the floodgates for an overwhelming 427-1 vote on Tuesday.His reversal was a rare instance of Republican politicians pressuring Trump into action, and into a very public change in stance, rather than the other way around.Regardless of what new information any future files may contain, the saga exposed fractures within the Republican Party and highlighted the power of Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) base.It also has shown that, despite his best efforts, he may have struggled to move attention away from the Epstein files if he had not backed the vote.\"I think he sees that this is an issue he's underwater in with average Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and Republican strategist in Georgia.\"I think Trump had to do this in this point in time because he wants to be back on the right side,\" she added.A NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken at the end of September - when Trump was yet to back the release of the files - suggested that 67% of Republican registered voters supported the release of all Epstein files with victims' names redacted. Another 18% supported releasing some of the files with similar redactions.\"Transparency on what happened is extremely important to the voters,\" Chris Ager, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told the BBC.He praised Trump's reversal, arguing it was the sign of a healthy party \"that you can have a disagreement on an issue... and come to a conclusion where essentially everyone is agreeing: Let's release the files\".Getty ImagesCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said on Tuesday that the Epstein files saga had \"ripped Maga apart\"Maga 'ripped apart'For much of this year, however, there were sharp disagreements on the issue. Trump's reversal came as it looked increasingly likely he could face a revolt in the House.The most notable defector, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, said at a press conference with Epstein survivors on Tuesday that the saga had \"ripped Maga apart\". Due to her vocal opposition, Trump dubbed her a \"traitor\" on Truth Social. Typically, such a public attack from the president would quiet dissent from a Republican, especially one up for re-election. But in a sign of the political potency of the Epstein issue, Greene pushed back.\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off this discharge petition,\" Greene said on Tuesday.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene directs anger at Trump over Epstein filesThe House would advance the legislation, Greene said, \"because the American people who we serve as representatives here in Congress demanded this vote happen\".Greene, who first broke with Trump in the spring, has been the public face of building dissent within Trump's Maga movement - not just on Epstein, but on other issues such as the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June and the president's continuing focus on foreign wars.But on the Epstein issue in particular, Greene and others in the movement have called for greater transparency despite Trump's desire to focus on other issues. And after Tuesday's votes in Congress, they can claim real success.\"The saga reveals how much power the Republican base now wields,\" party strategist Rina Shah told NPR in the summer. \"MAGA voters are furious.\"\"This pressure is forcing even the most loyal Trump allies to break ranks. And it signals a Republican Party that's increasingly populist, where the grassroots can push leaders to act or they have to pay a price.\"The Epstein vote has also overshadowed other White House initiatives. Last week, President Trump announced he would roll back tariffs on groceries like coffee, bananas and beef as Americans' cost of living concerns increased.\"I think he'd rather people talk about those things than Epstein,\" Zoller, the Republican strategist in Georgia, said. One senior Trump administration official told Axios that the president decided to drop his opposition to the legislation because the noise around the Epstein issue was proving to be a \"major distraction\".Greene herself has said the White House was going down the wrong track by resisting the release of more Epstein files, instead of focusing on other issues.\"It's insanely the wrong direction to go,\" Greene told POLITICO. \"The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that's where the focus should be.\"The White House, meanwhile, said in a statement to the BBC that \"by releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"Even beyond Epstein, Trump's influence on the party has been tested - and even rebuffed this week. And there are signs of potential rifts, too.His public efforts to encourage Indiana's leaders to redraw their congressional maps to favour Republicans before the 2026 midterm elections hit a potentially critical roadblock on the same day as the Epstein vote.Watch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?The Republican-controlled Indiana Senate voted on Tuesday to adjourn until January, signalling it would not take up the issue of redistricting. That is despite major pressure from the president as well as the state's Republican governor who has asked lawmakers to work on redrawing maps.Trump has even threatened to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting. But as with the Epstein issue, there has been defiance within the party.\"I've been a legislator 42 years. I'm not going to change my vote,\" Republican Senator Vaneta Becker told CNN. Referring to the nickname for people from Indiana, she said: \"Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in a blackmail position. It does not bode well.\"But as those close to Trump have noted, he has navigated fallouts and internal opposition in the past. Despite this defiance on several fronts, the president remains the most powerful figure in the party. \"I think the president is going to be praised for the fact that the information gets released and is out. At the end of the day, it's results, not the sausage making that got us there,\" said Mr Ager, referring to the Epstein files.Trump said as much himself in a Truth Social posted Tuesday night, remarking that he did not care when Senate Republicans passed the bill. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\"",

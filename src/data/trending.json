    "body": "Sheffield Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen wants \"a new Wednesday with an old heart\" as fan groups discuss the potential of a supporter-led ownership of the stricken Championship club.The Yorkshire club was placed into administration on Friday and handed an automatic 12-point deduction by the EFL, leaving them bottom of the second tier on minus six points.It does, though, effectively end the reign of deeply unpopular owner Dejphon Chansiri, with administrators Begbies Traynor now tasked with finding new owners for the club.BBC Sheffield report there are interested buyers and administrators are already in active discussions with interested investors.If nothing is forthcoming, the Sheffield Wednesday Supporters Trust (SWST) says it has been working for the past few months to see what action it can take. \"We have been working to develop a credible, fan-led takeover proposal,\" it said in a statement., external\"This ensures that even in the worst-case scenario, the threat of liquidation will not be an option.\"  The administration announcement was the culmination in a dark period in Wednesday's long and storied history.The past few months have been dominated by delayed wage payments, player departures, fan protests and finally a boycott of attending matches as Owls supporters despaired at the manner in which their beloved club was being run.Earlier this month it was revealed that His Majesty's Revenue & Customs was seeking a winding-up petition, with the club owing £1m.But there is relief that Chansiri will now depart and Wednesday can move forward in a different direction.  \"Today marks one of the most bittersweet days in our club's proud 158-year history,\" added the SWST.\"Entering administration was the inevitable outcome of years of financial mismanagement, a lack of accountability, and repeated failures to engage credible buyers. \"Administration is not something to be celebrated. It needn't have ended this way. But we are overjoyed to have Dejphon Chansiri out of our club for good.\"On the pitch, Wednesday now find themselves 15 points from safety after 11 games with fellow strugglers Oxford United at Hillsborough on Saturday (15:00 BST).After their squad was decimated in the summer and the club placed under a transfer embargo to bring in new players, they have won only one league match but Pedersen, appointed following the departure of Danny Rohl, has produced a competitive team.But for the Dane there is initial optimism about the return of more fans to Hillsborough for Saturday following the boycott of Wednesday's match against Middlesbrough.\"It was awful the other evening,\" Pedersen told BBC Radio Sheffield. \"But opposite, it can be fantastic tomorrow, to be together again and to have this experience.\"I'm really, really looking forward to this day that we are one club again.\"In his time at Hillsborough, first as assistant to Rohl and now in full charge, Pedersen has gained a deep respect for the club and its supporters and he would like that to be at the forefront for any prospective new owners.\"Money is one thing but the strategy is important with understanding and respect for Sheffield Wednesday,\" he added.\"We have to be Sheffield Wednesday. We have to be a new Sheffield Wednesday with an old heart. We have to keep this understanding because we have a fantastic club, but this fantastic club deserves to grow.\"While the immediate prospects are not good with the Owls facing an uphill task to avoid relegation to League One, fans are more optimistic for the longer term again.\"We needed somebody to listen, somebody to act, and somebody to give us that hope back that I can pass to my kids,\" Wednesday fan Gaz Robinson told BBC Sport.\"We're back. My kids can start going to games again. I should be upset, but weirdly, I'm really, really happy.\"     Midfielder Barry Bannan has been a stalwart in the Wednesday side since his arrival back in 2015 and signed a new deal in August despite the departures of many of his team-mates, following multiple delayed payments of player and staff wages.\"We've known for a while that this could be the route that it was going to go down. Obviously it's a sad day for the club first and foremost, you don't really want to be going into administration,\" the 35-year-old told BBC Radio Sheffield.\"As a group of players, it's made our task a lot harder this season as well so it was hard news to take but this needed to happen, we couldn't keep going on the way it was going on.\"The task becomes bigger but I think for the club going forward, it's probably the right thing that's happened.\"Bannan has made 460 appearances for the club in his decade-long spell and he understands the fans' frustrations, but emphasised the importance of the atmosphere at Hillsborough.\"We totally got what they were doing, we were never against it as players and staff, we just wanted to play games,\" he added. \"I said that when the fans came on to the pitch the other week, that was the only bit of joy we're getting as a group of players and staff was playing three o'clock on a Saturday.\"We got what they were doing but now we need them more than ever, we've needed them all season at home and unfortunately we've not really had that atmosphere.\"But now the fans have got what they wanted, this is where we really need them to come and get behind us and be that extra man.\"Bannan's message was echoed in a statement by the players issued on official club channels.\"After what has been a period of division and a feeling of 'disconnect' between the club, the players and the fans, we now hope this is the time we can all come back together under the badge and enjoy our football again,\" the statement read., external\"So we ask you, starting tomorrow against Oxford, please come back to Hillsborough and cheer the team on. Let's make the ground a place for teams to fear as we do everything we can to get the points we are going to so desperately need.\"Think back to the comeback against Peterborough, wins against Arsenal and Newcastle. That was you in the stands as much as us on the pitch!\"We won't give up, and we ask you not to give up on us. Together we are stronger. Together we can fight.\"Rob Staton, BBC Radio Sheffield reporterAs soon as administration was confirmed, we were allowed into Hillsborough Stadium and walked out into the stands. Already, the name 'Chansiri' - emblazoned across the seats of the North Stand during his time as owner - was being replaced.It was so symbolic. Fans roared their approval online when they saw the photos and videos we published. This was it - the new era the fans so desperately wanted.There's an air of relief around the club. Although administration is far from ideal and will carry several unknowns, there's a feeling that things couldn't continue as they were. Something needed to change and now it will.The club will eventually have new owners and we're already hearing that people have been reaching out to the administrators voicing their interest.In the immediate future though it's about fans returning. That's what the administrators are now calling for. From boycotts on Wednesday night at Hillsborough to needing to fill the ground. Every penny is vital now to keep the club running.The atmosphere for the Oxford United game this weekend could be electric. It could be emotional. Fans returning who had to force themselves to stay away. People who gave up their favourite thing, for the good of the club.The fans helped force change and will be able to dream of a better future now, even if there are short-term challenges.",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in trial had argued for Benkired to received the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

Setting out the case, James Berry KC, representing the Met, said: \"The Panorama footage demonstrates PC Sinclair-Birt boasted about and revelled in the use of force, and what he was describing was an excessive use of force, on a detainee.\"In the undercover footage, played to the panel, Mr Sinclair-Birt was seen describing the arrest saying he \"whacked....the back of his legs trying to get him to drop to the floor\".He went on to say, \"there's definitely a little bit of red mist there\".The officer was seen smiling during the incident, which the Met said indicated a \"troubling lack of remorse or concern for a member of the public\".The hearing was told the conduct of the officer breached the Met's standards of professional behaviour and the conduct amounted to gross misconduct.Mr Sinclair-Birt denied the allegation against him, but accepted he made the comments which appeared in the programme.In his statement, he said the comments made to the undercover reporter were \"empty words and not a true account of the underlying incident\".He said he was \"embellishing the account of an actual stop and search and he was doing so for comedic effect\".The hearing was played body-worn footage from the stop and search which took place in July 2022, and showed Mr Sinclair-Birt did not use his baton during the incident.The panel was told Mr Sinclair-Birt used \"lawful and proportionate force\" throughout the arrest to get the detainee to sit down.Giving his decision Chair Commander Jason Prins said: \"The officer has chosen to share a false account which revelled in the use of force.He added: \"In my view the false account was meant to be taken at face value.\"Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the Met was \"grateful\" for Panorama's investigation but criticised the BBC for waiting too long to disclose unaired footage of the officers. Sir Mark said it was \"extremely frustrating\" that the delays had resulted in adjournment applications and \"unnecessary complications\". Friday's scheduled hearing for Sgt Clayton Robinson will now take place on 28 October. Three others have been adjourned to a later date. The misconduct process was launched after the Panorama programme was aired on 1 October. An undercover BBC reporter heard officers at Charing Cross police station threatening to shoot immigrants, dismissing claims of rape, and using excessive force on detainees. On Thursday, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg faced expedited misconduct hearings over the footage. All three denied allegations of gross misconduct but accepted they made the comments aired in the programme.Chair of the panel, Cdr Jason Prins, described the conduct of the officers as a \"disgrace\".Ten former and current police officers at Charing Cross station are facing accelerated misconduct hearings over footage of the investigation.

Temperatures will be below average with strong, gusty winds making it feel especially cold and raw.This change in weather is driven by the position of Storm Benjamin in the North Sea, drawing down a cold Arctic northerly airflow across the UK.Image caption, Cold arctic air will affect all of the UK this weekendBeware the biting windIn the wake of Storm Benjamin, the UK will come under the influence of a brisk northerly wind, which could reach gale force at times along eastern counties on Saturday.Frequent showers are expected in coastal areas—especially along north-facing shores.Whilst there will be some autumnal sunshine, temperatures are set to dip slightly below average for the time of year, with daytime highs ranging between just 8 and 11C.But with that biting, Arctic wind it could feel up to 5C colder, especially on the east coast of Scotland and north-east England.Where will it snow?If showers fall over high ground - mainly above 400m - there is the chance these will turn to snow.This is most likely over the highest ground in Scotland where a few centimetres of snow accumulation are possible. There may also be a touch of wintriness over the highest hills of northern England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.But it's all change again next week.A change in wind direction will bring milder temperatures. Then by the end of the week, heavy rain and strong winds look likely.You can keep up to date with the weather where you are on the BBC Weather app or by checking the forecast online.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "3 hours agoZahra FatimaPA MediaWindrush Commissioner Reverend Clive Foster had been tasked with looking at how to improve the compensation schemeVictims of the Windrush Scandal will get 75% of their compensation in advance, as part of changes to the government scheme.The Home Office said applicants aged 75 and over, as well as those with serious health conditions, will be prioritised - in a effort to ensure speedier justice.For the first time, victims will also be compensated for lost contributions to pensions, as well as any immigration fees they have had to pay.The Windrush Compensation scheme - which was set up in 2019 - has faced intense criticism from campaigners and legal experts for ongoing processing delays, low offers and unfair rejections.The scandal first came to light in 2018 after it was revealed that the Home Office had failed to keep records of people with indefinite leave to remain in the UK - and had not issued paperwork needed to confirm their legal status.Thousands of Caribbean migrants who came to the UK between 1948 to 1973 and had the right to remain, were wrongly classified as illegal citizens and denied access to homes, jobs and NHS care. Many others were threatened with or faced detention and deportation.Official figures published last month showed that so far just over £116m had been paid in compensation since the scheme's launch.But 15,000 people were thought to be eligible when it was set up.In June, a damning report suggested that two-thirds of Windrush claimants had not received any compensation at all.Others have received significantly less than they might be entitled to due to lack of legal assistance, the report says. One woman previously told the BBC her father had been offered just £400.Under the new rules, victims who have appealed the government's offer will receive an advance payment of three quarters of the amount, while they wait for their review to be completed.\"It is unacceptable that many victims are still waiting for compensation all these years later. That changes today,\" said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Friday.Describing the scandal as a \"shameful stain on our history\", Mahmood added: \"I will leave no stone unturned until everyone affected receives the justice they deserve.\"In June, the government announced the first Windrush Commissioner, Reverend Clive Foster, who is responsible for speaking up for victims and looking at ways to improve the compensation scheme.Last month, he wrote to the government about why victims with the scheme, saying there was a perception that \"the Home Office is waiting for us to die off\".He added he did not feel himself this was the case, but wanted to reflect victims' views.Speaking after the announcement, Mr Foster said the changes will \"make a real difference, especially for those who don't have time on their side.\"But he warned rolling out the changes must be \"swift and sustained,\" adding \"trust will only be rebuilt through action, and I will continue to press for progress on all my outstanding recommendations\".The changes were announced by the Migration and Citizenship Minister Mike Tapp, who spoke at the Windrush National Organisation conference in Birmingham.Windrush is one of the few major state schemes that does not provide legal assistance and the Home Office has so far rejected calls for it to be introduced.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  , Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said \"a lot of countries\" have offered to be part of an international security force for Gaza - a key part of President Donald Trump's peace plan - but added Israel would have to be comfortable with participants.Speaking on a visit to Israel, Rubio said talks on forming the International Stabilization Force (ISF) were continuing and that it would come into effect \"as soon as it possibly can\".It remained unclear, however, how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.He said the Israel-Hamas ceasefire had made \"historic\" progress since it began two weeks ago, but warned to expect \"ups and downs and twists and turns\".\"There is no plan B,\" he said. \"This is the best plan. It's the only plan. And it's one that we think can succeed.\" Rubio said conditions had to be created \"so that never again will we see what happened on 7 October, so that you can actually be in a place [Gaza] that no longer has elements operating within it that are a threat to Israel or to their own people for that matter\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.At least 68,280 Palestinians have been killed by the Israel military campaign that followed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the United Nations as reliable.Rubio said Hamas will be disarmed, as required by Trump's plan. \"If Hamas refuses to demilitarise, it'll be a violation of the agreement and that'll have to be enforced,\" he said.\"Hamas cannot govern and cannot be involved in governing the future of Gaza,\" he added.Rubio's visit caps a week in which senior American officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, came to Israel. It's a sign that Washington is determined to make Trump's plan for Gaza succeed and is concerned that actions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government might collapse it. In Israeli media, the effort has been described as \"Bibi-sitting\", a play with the prime minister's nickname.In recent days, multiple reports have suggested the White House's frustration with the Israeli government, fuelled by the military's deadly response to an attack it blamed on Hamas in Gaza last weekend and the vote in the Israeli parliament towards the annexation of the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, while Vance was visiting.The Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported that American officials said they would \"not tolerate any surprises from Israel that could jeopardise the ceasefire\", and that they were expecting advance notice from Israel before any strikes in Gaza. \"In practice,\" the report said, \"the US [was] taking over certain security authorities from Israel\".In public, Netanyahu, whose coalition relies on the support of ultra-nationalist ministers, has rejected reports that Washington is making decisions on Israel's behalf, describing the country's relationship as a partnership. The apparent pressure from the country's most important ally, at a time when Israel faces unprecedented isolation, risks derailing his strategy to frame the war in Gaza as a victory at home. This narrative will be essential in the campaign for the next parliamentary election, which should be held by October 2026.Both Rubio and Vance tried to strike a positive tone in their public statements – both said they were optimistic the ceasefire would hold – while also acknowledging that the negotiations over the remaining points would be difficult and long. Those issues include the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, the future governance of Gaza and the formation of the ISF, as well as the disarmament by Hamas, and they offered no indication of how those talks would proceed.Rubio said there were \"a lot of countries\" that offered to take part in the ISF. \"Obviously, as you put together this force, it'll have to be people that Israel's comfortable, or countries that Israel's comfortable with as well,\" he added, without elaborating.This appeared to be a reference to Turkey, which has become a major player in the negotiations, amid reports Israel has vetoed the country's involvement.The scope of the ISF's mission remains unclear, as countries appear to be concerned with the possibility that its forces might end up confronting Hamas fighters if there is no agreement with the group over the ISF deployment.Seeing the peace plan through is \"not going to be an easy ride\", Rubio said. \"There are going to be bumps along the road, but we have to make it work.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaChancellor Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out an income tax rise in next month's Budget, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.Asked about reports, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that the Treasury is in active discussions over raising the rate, Reeves said she would \"continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\".Reeves' refusal to rule out a rise does not mean one is inevitable as Chancellors rarely confirm or deny specific tax measures ahead of a Budget.But her careful language contrasts with comments in September that \"manifesto commitments stand\" on not raising income tax, National Insurance or VAT.Labour's 2024 general election manifesto contained a pledge not to raise \"the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax\".The party also promised not to increase National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.Speaking to journalists in Leeds on Friday, Reeves said: \"Although I can't talk about individual measures at this stage, I understand that the cost of living is still people's number one concern.\"She went on to say that her aim was to \"ensure that we continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\" but that she was still  \"going through the process\" of writing her Budget.She also said that although the inflation figures this week \"came in better than expected\" there was \"obviously much more to do.\"The chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals at the Budget, saying \"those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\".This week, reports suggested officials are exploring a mix of measures, including higher taxes on partnerships used by lawyers and accountants.However, economists say such steps will not raise enough to close the hole in the government's finances, leaving Reeves under pressure to consider more politically sensitive options.Influential think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes to make up a £22bn shortfall in the government's finances.The gap has been driven by the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) decision to downgrade productivity forecasts, wiping out much of the £10bn \"headroom\" Reeves set aside at the spring statement. Government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - in September rose to £20.2bn, the highest for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics.The effective interest rates on UK government debt has fallen sharply, but Reeves has been left with very little room to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules without increasing taxes. These rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.If Reeves increases income tax it will be the first rise in the rate since 2010, when Labour introduced a 50% additional rate on incomes over £150,000 which was reduced to 45% by the coalition government. Currently, Income tax is charged on earnings above the personal allowance of £12,570, which is tax-free. The basic rate of 20% applies to income between £12,571 and £50,27, while earnings from £50,271 to £125,140 are taxed at the higher rate of 40%. Income above £125,140 is subject to the additional rate of 45%. These thresholds apply to most taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while Scotland has a separate system.The Guardian reported that Treasury officials are in \"active discussions\" about adding 1p to the basic rate of income tax, which could raise more than £8bn as well - as looking at increasing higher rates for top earners. The basic rate of income tax has not been raised since the 1970s.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJaroslav Lukiv and Vitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor at Downing StreetEPA/ShutterstockMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the \"coalition of the willing\" in London.The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets - including oil refineries and weapons depots - deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, President Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Starmer said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas EveIn London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding that \"they want to break us\".Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing but unsurprising for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Ukraine's allies were planning to make Russia stop attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Starmer said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or make Putin come to the negotiating table.EPA/ShutterstockUkrainian officials say a kindergarten was hit in a Russian air strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv earlier this weekOver in Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with President Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor - their third meeting this year.",

    "body": "46 minutes agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent, the Old Bailey and Andre Rhoden-PaulMetropolitan PoliceJake Reeves, left, was brought into the plot by Dylan Earl Six men have been jailed for their parts in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine. The fire at industrial units in Leyton, east London, on 20 March 2024 caused £1.3m in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl was recruited by the Wagner Group, a mercenary organisation that acts on behalf of the Russian state and is proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist organisation. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison plus a further six years on extended licence. Before his arrest, he was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident. Earl, 21, from Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, admitted a National Security Act offence and aggravated arson, along with Jake Reeves, 24, from Croydon, who was given 12 years in prison plus one year on extended licence.Reeves helped Earl recruit a group of men to carry out the arson. The pair are the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023. The act is designed to tackle threats that fall short of traditional spying and can involve third party actors not working directly for a hostile state, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says. Of the other four men sentenced:Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, who streamed the attack, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for nine yearsAshton Evans, 20, from Newport, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, convicted for failing to tell police what he knew about a planned kidnapping, and jailed for nine years.Jakeem Rose, 23, from Croydon, who set the buildings alight, pleaded guilty to have a bladed article in a public place, convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for eight years and 10 months Ugnius Asmena, 21, of no fixed address, who arranged the getaway car and was there on the night, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for seven years All four each received a further year on extended licence.Earl contacted the Wagner Group on messaging app Telegram and told his handler he was keen to carry out a series of \"missions\", of which Leyton would be the first, the court previously heard. In the chat, Earl's contact instructed him to watch Cold War spy drama The Americans and use it as a \"manual\".Earl then brought in other men to carry out the arson attack. The Ukrainian-owned warehouse they targeted had been used to send goods to Ukraine, including Starlink satellite terminals, and it required eight fire crews with 60 firefighters to get the blaze under control. Earl was supposed to receive £9,000 for his role but was paid less because he carried out the plan early without his handler's sign-off.On Friday, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the case as a \"planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage\" in the interests of the Russian state. Police footage shows arson attack ringleader's arrestAfter the warehouse attack, Earl and Reeves set the group's sights on an arson attack on a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair and the kidnap of owner Evgeny Chichvarkin, a critic of the Russian state.But before he could carry it out, he was arrested in a B&Q car park in Leicestershire, and videos of the warehouse fire being started were found on his phone. In a search of the drug dealer's home, police recovered a Russian flag, more than £20,000 in cash and cocaine with a street value of some £34,000.Evidence on his phone revealed details of a cryptocurrency account holding more than £58,000 and images of bundles of cash estimated to total £175,000.Earl also admitted possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.Metropolitan PoliceThe fire caused about £1.3m worth of damage to the warehouseCommander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Policing, told the BBC Earl was \"somebody working absolutely as an agent of a foreign state to sow unrest and commit crimes in this country\". He added Russia presents \"a very real threat to our national security\" and it was not unusual now to see Russia contacting people online and then using them to conduct criminal activity on their behalf. Security minister Dan Jarvis said the sentences sent a clear message that the UK would not tolerate hostile activity by foreign states. \"To those acting for a foreign state, as the head of MI5 has said, you are disposable and you will not receive your reward, just as these individuals found out,\" he warned.

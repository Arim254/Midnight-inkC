    "body": "Thousands of military homes across the UK will be modernised, refurbished or rebuilt over the next decade under a £9bn government plan to improve defence housing.The Ministry of Defence's new housing strategy will see improvements made to almost all of its 47,700 homes for military families in what Defence Secretary John Healey said will be the \"biggest renewal of Armed Forces housing in more than 50 years\".The plan is in response to consistent complaints from serving personnel about the state of their accommodation. In 2022, dozens of members and their families told the BBC they were having to live in damp, mould-infested housing without heating.A Commons defence committee last year found two-thirds of homes for service families needed \"extensive refurbishment or rebuilding\" to meet modern standards.Under the new strategy, service family accommodation (SFA) will be refurbished with new kitchens, bathrooms and heating systems.About 14,000 will receive either \"substantial refurbishment\" or be completely replaced.The plans are part of the government's wider defence housing strategy, to be published on Monday. A total of £4bn in funding to tackle the housing problem had already been announced. The government says it has also identified surplus MoD land which could be used to build 100,000 new homes for civilian and military families.Healey said: \"This is a new chapter - a decisive break from decades of underinvestment, with a building programme to back Britain's military families and drive economic growth across the country.\"Almost three years ago, the BBC was contacted by families in military accommodation in Sandhurst who had been living without heating for days.\"We're at breaking point and something has to change. The system is broken,\" they said at the time.In response to the story, the MoD said it was working with its contractors to improve the service. But a report released in December last year found those problems \"still exist\". \"It is shocking that until a policy change in 2022, it was considered acceptable to house families in properties known to have damp and mould,\" the report said.The MoD last year announced it would acquire 36,347 military houses from property company Annington Homes for nearly £6bn, reversing a privatisation deal struck in 1996 under the Conservative government.The deal would save millions in rent and maintenance costs, the MoD said, money that would be put towards fixing military accommodation.",

    "body": "Some of the early editions have witness reports about the stabbing attack on a train in Cambridgeshire. The Sun quotes a passenger as saying there was \"blood everywhere\" and that it was \"like something from a film\". The Times says witnesses described some passengers being \"stamped [on]\" as they tried to flee.\"2 p, or not 2p,\" wonders the Observer, as its columnist, Andrew Rawnsley, considers whether Chancellor Rachel Reeves may increase income tax in the Budget later this month. He suggests \"there'll be a steep penalty for breaking Labour's tax pledge - but the price may have to be paid.\" The Times says prominent tax campaigners are urging her to offer people earning a £100,000 a tax break, because of what it calls a \"tax trap\" deterring the ambition of people who could otherwise help drive the economy.The Telegraph says the chancellor is thinking about doubling the council tax on the most expensive properties in the Budget - which could lead to some homeowners paying more than £10,000 a year. The paper says the Conservatives believe this will leave many pensioners - particularly in London - unable to afford their bills. Its cartoonist Matt depicts Guy Fawkes, carrying a barrel of gunpowder, saying \"I'm planning to blow up my own house. I'm worried about a mansion tax.\"The Mail on Sunday revisits a different story about the chancellor. It says two estate agents told her she would need a licence to rent out her home - and reminds readers that she originally told the prime minister that she didn't know she needed a permit. The paper says a spokesperson for Reeves pointed to the fact that the prime minister's adviser on ministerial standards advised that no further investigation was necessary.\"Come clean, Mr Windsor,\" is the Sunday Mirror's headline, as it reports that the ex-Duke of York is facing mounting pressure to speak to a powerful Congressional committee in the US, set up to investigate the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Express quotes a top US civil rights lawyer as saying the King should urge his brother to testify. The Sun looks closer to home, saying pressure is also mounting for a Scotland Yard inquiry into the former Duke of York - who denies any wrong-doing. Writing in the Mail, Sharon Churcher - who first published the photo of Andrew with Virginia Giuffre - says \"the story doesn't end with him; there are other powerful men who must be held accountable.\"\"The gloves are off,\" says the Observer as it considers the autobiography of the former England women's football goal-keeper Mary Earps. It says that in the book, Earps criticises manager Sarina Wiegman and reveals her fury at being replaced as goalkeeper by Hannah Hampton. The paper says \"the comments are a marked change from the usual tone around the women's game, which has more commonly been celebrated for its positive atmosphere.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoCachella Smith and Will Grant,in KingstonA flight chartered by the UK government to evacuate British nationals from Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Melissa is due to land at London's Gatwick Airport on Sunday.The flight, which left Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport on Saturday, comes after the UK flew in aid as part of a £7.5m regional emergency package.Some of the funding will be used to match public donations up to £1m to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those to have donated.Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, blocked roads have complicated distribution after Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 19 people.The hurricane made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a category five storm, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the Caribbean.Melissa swept across the region over a number of days, leaving behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 30 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.The UK Foreign Office has asked citizens there to register their presence and advised travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options were available.The UK initially set aside a £2.5m immediate financial support package for the region, with an additional £5m announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday as \"more information... on the scale of the devastation\" emerged.The British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.The Red Cross said that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Until the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital. So too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis.Meanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find.The BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others to drive to an area where they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island.The country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, described \"significant damage\" across a number of hospitals on Saturday - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected.\"That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,\" he said. \"The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services.\"Dr Tufton added: \"What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet.\"The minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a daily supply of water.Landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating the distribution of aid across the island.However, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief by Sunday.At least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out from Kingston on Saturday with a seven-truck convoy heading to Black River, the badly damaged town in western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida. Help is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter.It remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon.",

    "body": "Bonfire Night's Beaver supermoon to be biggest and brightest of 2025Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Fireworks night in Sefton Park, Liverpool, in 2009 featuring an almost full MoonBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter The second of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 will coincide with Bonfire Night on Wednesday.The full Beaver Moon rises in the UK at around 15:55 GMT on 5 November.It will be the largest and brightest Moon this year.If you want to catch a glimpse, keep an eye on the forecast to see where has the best chance of seeing clear skies.Why is this Moon a 'supermoon'?Image caption, At its 'perigee' the Moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than at its 'apogee'The Moon does not orbit the earth in a perfect circle but has more of an egg-shaped, elliptical orbit. Therefore it is not always the same distance from the Earth.  At its closest point - or perigee - the Moon is about 220,000 miles away from Earth, whereas at its furthest point - or apogee - it is around 250,000 miles away.If the Moon is full at its closest point to Earth, or within 90% of its perigee, it can be referred to as a 'supermoon'.  The term was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to describe full Moons that appear noticeably larger and brighter as they coincide with the perigee. They can seem to be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full Moons, external.November's Beaver Moon will be the closest full Moon to Earth this year, therefore it will be the brightest and will appear to be the largest.Image source, Dan Kitwood/Getty imagesImage caption, Last month's Harvest supermoon - pictured here with a passenger plane flying above London -  was the first of the yearWhy is it a called a Beaver Moon?Image source, Andrew Matthews/PA WireImage caption, After centuries of absence, beavers are starting to roam wild again in parts of England and ScotlandEach month's full Moon has a nickname reflecting what is happening in nature and the weather at that time of year. Many of these names date back centuries and some are more obvious than others such as February's 'Snow Moon' or June's 'Strawberry Moon'.But what about November's Beaver Moon? It is thought that the term may have been used in a range of cultures from certain Native American tribes to early European settlers.  It is the time of year beavers become particularly active as they build dams and stock up on food for the winter.Beavers in the UK were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century, mainly for their furs.  However, in recent years rewilding projects have been reintroducing beavers to several parts of England and Scotland. They can bring huge benefits to nature, including improving river water quality and increasing biodiversity.Whilst this will be the brightest and largest full Moon of 2025, you won't have to wait long until the next one, as we will see the third and final supermoon of the year on 4 December.What is the forecast?Image caption, Current most likely weather conditions for Bonfire Night's Beaver Moon viewingThe week ahead is looking changeable, with a series of low pressure systems expected to move west to east across the UK. This means spells of rain and wind at times interspersed with calmer and drier interludes.It is too soon to say exactly where will have optimum viewing conditions for the Beaver Moon on Wednesday but the current most likely weather pattern is for a frontal system to bring cloud and rain to the south, with increasing chances of clearer skies and drier conditions further north.Keep up to date with the forecast as we approach Bonfire Night by checking the BBC Weather website or App.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "12 hours agoGuy DelauneyBalkans correspondent, in Novi SadWatch: Video shows aftermath of railway station roof collapse in SerbiaA sea of people flowed along the roads leading up to Novi Sad railway station.They came in their tens of thousands to remember the 16 people who died there this time last year, on another unseasonably warm and sunny autumn day.The victims were standing or sitting underneath a concrete canopy at the recently-renovated facility, when it collapsed. The two youngest were just six years old, the oldest, 77.Regular protests have rocked Serbia in the 12 months that have followed. But on Saturday morning, the huge crowd participated in an event that put the emphasis on quiet commemoration.At 11:52 (10:52 GMT), the time of the disaster, they observed a silence for 16 minutes - one for each of the victims. Family members cried. One woman needed to be physically supported by men wearing the red berets of armed forces veterans.After the silence, relatives laid flowers at the front of the station. The rubble of the collapsed canopy has been cleared away, but otherwise the building appears to have remained untouched since the disaster.Twisted metal protruding from the walls and broken glass still offer evidence of the catastrophe.Fourteen dead in Serbia railway station canopy collapseFury over Serbia station tragedy prompts first arrestsAnadolu via Getty ImagesHuge protests have been held against the government since the accidentNovi Sad station was supposed to be a symbol of Serbia's progress, under President Aleksandar Vučić's Progressive Party. The country's second city would be a key stop on the high-speed railway line whipping passengers from Belgrade to Budapest in less than three hours.Vučić and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban jointly opened the renovated facility in 2022. Its angular, Yugoslav-era form had been upgraded as part of the high-speed project.But now, after another renovation and the disaster that followed, the station stands as the prime example of everything that is wrong in Serbia.For the government's flagship infrastructure project to prove deadly to its citizens was more than many people could bear. They took to the streets, carrying placards reading \"corruption kills\".University students quickly took leadership. Getty ImagesFamilies of those who died at Novi Sad laid flowers at the train stationAnti-government demonstrations are not exactly a novelty in Serbia, but in contrast to previous movements which fizzled out, the student-led anti-corruption protests have persisted.\"Every other protest movement was organised by political opposition parties and people in Serbia don't trust them,\" says Aleksa, a 23-year-old management student at Novi Sad University.\"We are the most trusted group in the country - that's why, even though we have made mistakes, people believe in us.\"The students have shunned the opposition parties. After initially demanding accountability from the authorities, they are now calling for fresh elections.They plan to submit a list of independent, expert candidates who could run a technocratic government. This would, they say, be the best way to rid Serbian institutions of the cronyism and corruption which they hold responsible for the railway station disaster.In September, 13 people, including former construction, infrastructure and Transport Minister Goran Vesić, were charged in a criminal case over the collapse.A resolution in the European Parliament last month called for full and transparent legal proceedings and an assessment \"of potential corruption or negligence\" - underlining the \"need to examine more broadly the extent to which corruption led to the lowering of safety standards and contributed to this tragedy\".The government has denied accusations of corruption.Students are more trusted in Serbia than opposition parties, says AleksaThe student protesters' approach has gained the respect of some opposition leaders.\"They showed integrity and perseverance,\" says Biljana Djordjević, an MP and co-leader of the Green-Left Front.\"The new generation have found their way of participating, that is the difference this time. They have cut across generations in the families, we always wanted them to be more vocal, and now they are.\"Political scientist Srdjan Cvijić, from the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, believes the students have cut through in a way that Serbia's opposition parties simply could no longer do.\"Until last year, the regime had been effectively managing to render traditional politics disgusting to the overall population,\" he says.\"They haven't managed to do so with the student movement and the result is that the student movement has managed to pierce into the traditional electorate of the ruling party in a way that nobody previously managed to do.\"Perhaps this explains a sudden change in tone from President Vučić. He has generally taken a combative line with the protesters, accusing them of attempting a \"colour revolution\" - the kind of popular movements that were behind pro-European protests which toppled governments in European countries in earlier years.  These changes in former Soviet republics in the early years of the 21st Century pushed the likes of Georgia and Ukraine in a pro-EU direction.But on the eve of the commemoration, Vučić apologised for his fiery rhetoric towards protesters, claiming that he had \"said some things that I am now sorry for saying\".The students responded dismissively. They told the president, \"You have blood on your hands.\"This day may have been about respect and remembrance. But the anger remains.",

On 19 April 1915 he was injured in the thigh while defending a trench at Hill 60, but was killed by a shell while being stretchered away.A letter sent home to his parents by Lt Col Griffith DSO described him as a \"most courageous and useful officer... very popular with all in the regiment\".2nd Lt Kellie was buried on Hill 60, but later moved to Railway Dugouts burial ground in West Flanders.2nd Lt Hopkins arrived in France in October 1914 and moved between battalions of the Bedfordshire Regiment.At the time of his death in May 1915 he was attached to the 1st Battalion, who were engaged in the struggle for Hill 60.In 1922, an unknown British Officer of the Bedfordshire Regiment was reburied at Bedford House cemetery.Crown CopyrightThe service was held indoors due to Storm Benjamin, and was attended by 10 members of 2nd Lt Hopkins' family\"In the ensuing 110 years, they have lain as unknown officers,\" said Ms Clark.She said members of the public had carried out research about who was buried in the graves, and submitted the details to the MOD.The MOD then worked with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) to replace the headstone and arrange a service.Daniel Seaton, of the CWGC, said: \"It is always moving to be able to transfer a name from one of the Commission's Memorials to the Missing to a named grave in our care.\"More than a century after their deaths, this has now been possible for 2nd Lts Kellie and Hopkins, whose final resting places will continue to be tended to by the commission.\"Related storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoPete AllisonBBC NewsbeatIsha Shah\"All-singing, all-dancing\" Paddington, as he appears in the new West End musicalHe's famous for his voyage from Peru to London, but it didn't take as long as his journey to the Savoy Theatre.After nearly a decade in the works, Paddington: The Musical is here.And its star is walking, talking, singing, dancing - and offering BBC Newsbeat a snack.\"I've brought you this marmalade sandwich, but it's only for emergencies.\"It's the first public glimpse of the impressive bear, whose design was a closely guarded secret for years.His fur is pristine.His famous \"hard stare\" is piercing.His face is so expressive, every twitch will reach the back row of an audience.But if you're looking for insight into his \"magical\" design and how he was brought to life, his creators aren't giving much away.Jay BrooksPaddington's design is inspired by Peggy Fortnum's \"delicate\" illustrations for author Michael Bond's 1958 book, A Bear Called PaddingtonWhen Newsbeat asks, everyone involved in the West End production gives the same response.\"Paddington is Paddington.\"And designer Tahra Zafar, an experienced creative whose CV includes Harry Potter, Marvel and Star Wars films, wants to keep it that way. \"I don't want people to think about how we've done it,\" she says.\"I just want people to love him.\"She does let on that the team looked at \"some very innovative ways\" to get Paddington moving, but says traditional puppetry was ruled out.They concluded that audiences' hearts wouldn't shatter at the bear's loneliness in London if he was literally kept company on-stage.The theory is currently being tested as Paddington gets some preview performances under his hat before the show's official opening in late November.\"I feel completely ready,\" laughs Tahra, with a mix of excitement and relief.\"I love him to bits, but I want to share him.\"'I just burst into tears'Rachel JosephTom Fletcher is juggling touring the UK and Ireland with McFly and Busted with launching Paddington: The MusicalMichael Bond's original creation has broken and warmed hearts for generations.A trilogy of films, with Ben Whishaw voicing its lead, made more than $500m (£380m) at the global box office.But no previous adaptation of Paddington's story brought him to life in such a tangible way.And no-one had found his voice in musical theatre until producers set McFly singer-songwriter Tom Fletcher that task.\"You can spend forever thinking 'how do I write a song that sounds like Paddington?',\" he tells Newsbeat.\"You just have to trust that it's going to come through, as long as you've done the research.\"Moments into Tom's initial call with producers, he started composing a song that remains in the musical five years later.\"I think I wrote five songs in that first process and they're all still in the show,\" he says.\"I know on paper 'that guy from McFly' may be an odd choice, but I was in musicals from the age of nine. \"I never thought I would end up in a band.\"For me, this is a return to what I love,\" he says, decades after playing the lead in Oliver! at the London Palladium.As for Paddington: The Musical's star, Tom first met him two years ago.The bear's design and technology waited in the wings while the cast and production were pulled together around it.\"You never forget when you first meet Paddington,\" Tom says, echoing a sentiment almost everyone involved tells Newsbeat with a glassy look in their eyes.\"I just burst into tears,\" says Tom.\"Once we met him, we all thought: 'This is going to work, and it's going to be so special'.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this story",

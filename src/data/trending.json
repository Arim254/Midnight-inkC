Local authorities have been trying to step up efforts to get a grip on the issue by using methods such as surveillance cameras to catch culprits.\"Ingenuity can never become an alibi for incivility,\" the municipality of Catania said in a post on its official Facebook page.\"Respect for urban etiquette and the environment is everyone's duty,\" it added.The post did not say whether any action had been taken.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRebecca Morelle,Science Editor,Alison Francis,Senior Science JournalistandGreg Brosnan,Senior Science JournalistShutterstockThe astronauts will begin their journey on Nasa's Space Launch System rocket Nasa is targeting early March to launch a crew around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, in what would be humankind's furthest trip into space.The Artemis II mission will see four astronauts embark on a 10-day journey around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for a future lunar landing.Nasa set the earliest launch date of March 6 (early on March 7 in the UK) following a successful \"wet dress rehearsal\" - a critical pre-launch test where the rocket is filled with fuel and taken through the countdown sequence.It was the Artemis team's second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\"Every night I look up at the Moon and I see it and I get real excited because I can feel she's calling us and we're ready,\" Nasa's Lori Glaze told a news conference on Friday.\"The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build, we can really start to feel it. It's coming.\"The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.\"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown,\" she said.Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.NASAApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt visited the Moon in 1972The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBBC/GettyRein Me In gives Olivia Dean her second number one single, and Fender his firstSam Fender and Olivia Dean have made UK chart history after their slow-burning collaboration, Rein Me In, finally made it to number one after 35 weeksThe song - Fender's first ever chart-topping single - finally reached the summit on Friday, breaking the record for the most consecutive weeks in the top 40 before reaching number one.The soulful pop-rock love song has been a mainstay on the singles chart since its release last June, previously peaking at number five three times. The previous record was held by Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud, which spent 19 consecutive weeks slowly charming the nation before topping the chart in 2014.Asked about why he thought it took so long to reach the top, Fender told BBC Radio 1: \"I guess it's the internet, it travelled online and people come to it later, which is wonderful really because it's the music that's doing the talking.\"The new number one is a duet reworking of a track of the same name taken from Fender's third studio album, the Mercury Prize-winning People Watching.Fender noted the new version - a sort of lyrical two-way conversation about the end of a relationship - was \"all the better\" for having her input. \"Olivia made the song her own, and it took on a life of its own after we did it together,\" he said.The pair previously gave the melancholic ballad its live debut, performing it together during Fender's gig at the London Stadium - home of Dean's team West Ham United.She joined him onstage again, a week later, to sing the same song at St James' Park - home of Fender's beloved Newcastle United - like the home and the away leg of the same musical tie.Allow Google YouTube content?This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

    "body": "How a Zoom call led to a semi-pro table tennis player featuring in Marty Supreme 4 hours agoJasmine SandharandNaomi Clarke,BBC Newsbeat HandoutJosh Bennett rehearsed table tennis scenes on set with Timothée Chalamet for the award-winning film Josh Bennett never thought a video audition from his bed would lead to a role in the table tennis biopic Marty Supreme alongside Hollywood star Timothée Chalamet.The semi-professional table tennis player replied to a casting call advertised by the sport's governing body for England asking for British players, thinking he would just be an extra in the background. After acting out a scene for the small part of Ted Bailey over a Zoom call, Josh was cast and whisked out to New York to film.The 26-year-old, who lives in Leamington Spa, tells BBC Newsbeat the whole experience was \"bonkers\". The box-office hit has already secured Timothée best actor gongs at the Critics' Choice Awards and Golden Globes, and he is expected to continue his success at the  Bafta Film Awards on Sunday.It is up for 11 awards in total including best film, original screenplay and best director for Josh Safdie.A24Timothée Chalamet is the bookies' frontrunner heading into the Bafta Film Awards on SundayThe semi-fictionalised film is based on real-life post-war table tennis star Marty Reisman.Timothée has previously said he spent seven years mastering the sport after being approached for the starring role in 2018. In preparation for some of the intense rallies, Josh rehearsed with Timothée and Japanese table tennis player and actor Koto Kawaguchi, who plays Marty's rival Koto Endo in the film.\"I was lucky enough to actually do a one-to-one session with Timothée as well out in New York,\" he recalls.\"What a cool experience to be able to work with someone like him and to see the amount of effort that he put in as well for the role.\"Everyone from the table tennis world would appreciate the fact that people have gone to so much effort to get the table tennis part of this film really accurate.\"Josh features in the film as one of the players competing at the table tennis championships held in Wembley in London, and appears in a number of other scenes. However, he initially wasn't sure if he'd made the final cut and says it was \"really surreal\" to see his face pop up on the big screen within the first 10 minutes. Michael Loveder PhotographyJosh Bennett has played a host of international table tennis tournaments over the years Table tennis is a family affair for Josh, whose mum, uncles and siblings have all played over the years. He started around age five as soon he could hold a bat, and has gone on to play at international tournaments.Despite his experience, Josh had to learn some new techniques as the film features an older style of hardbat table tennis which was played in the 1950s, when the film is set.He says that style is \"a lot more explosive\" and you aren't able to get as much spin on the ball as you can now, due to the bats being made with just a layer of rubber and no sponge.\"If you see some videos of how they used to play, it was almost like they were dancing around the court, it wasn't aggressive,\" he explains. Since the film's release in December, Josh says he has seen a spike in interest in the sport. \"The impact of the film has been huge,\" he says.\"I've had friends at work or friends from school that I used to play with back in primary school at clubs and they have all messaged me since being like: 'You'll never guess what, today at work we set up a table and had a massive competition off the back of having seen the Marty Supreme film'.\" He hopes the interest will translate into more people attending the upcoming World Table Tennis Championships in April and May, which are being hosted in London to mark 100 years since the first World Championships were held in the city. And he is rooting for the film to smash it at the Bafta Film Awards on Sunday.\"I've never been so invested in wanting one specific film to win,\" he says.\"To see Timothée win best actor would be cool. To see the film win best picture - that would be awesome.\"Just to know that I played a small part in that happening would be really cool.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterDisney/PixarA new trailer for the forthcoming Toy Story movie, the fifth in the US animated adventure comedy film franchise, has been released by Disney and Pixar.It shows the return of Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Jessie and the rest of the toys as they come face-to-face with the latest modern threat to their existence - a frog-like tablet called Lilypad.Pixar said the newcomer has \"her own disruptive ideas about what is best for their kid, Bonnie\", raising the question: \"Will playtime ever be the same?\"The short clip also teases a reunion between Buzz and Woody, following the latter's decision to leave the gang to help abandoned toys in the previous film, 2019's Toy Story 4.Disney/PixarThe new film will see the toys threatened by the arrival of a new frog-like tablet device called LilypadThe films, set in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, have been hugely popular since the franchise launched in 1995. \"It's been too long cowboy,\" says space cadet Buzz - again voiced by Tim Allen - in the new trailer, released late on Thursday. He then embraces a now slightly balding Woody, as ever portrayed by Tom Hanks.The pair are later seen bickering just as they did in the old days. \"It's good to see them fighting again\" notes one of the other toys, Mr Potato Head - now voiced by Jeff Bergman following the death of Don Rickles.Joan Cusack reprises her roll as Jessie, while many other characters from the first four films return.They include the wisecracking piggy bank, Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Forky (Tony Hale) and Slinky Dog (Blake Clarke), as well as Keanu Reeves' Duke Kaboom.Disney/PixarJessie and Bullseye are among the old characters returning for the fifth instalmentAs for the newbies, Past Lives star Greta Lee voices Lilypad, while US chat show host Conan O'Brien plays a new character, Smarty Pants, opposite Anna Vocino as Mrs Potato Head and Scarlett Spears as Bonnie.Craig Robinson joins the cast as Atlas, a cheerful talking GPS hippo toy, and Ernie Hudson arrives as Combat Carl, alongside Shelby Rabara as Snappy, an excitable toy camera.Noting the changes in toy technology since the story first began more than 30 years ago, the tagline for the new film reads: \"Times may change but friends are forever.\"In the trailer for the new film - which will also feature another original score by Oscar winner, Randy Newman - we also hear Buzz declare: \"Our mission on this planet, is to make a child happy.\"Disney/PixarThe Toy Story franchise has spawned five films, as well as a Buzz Lightyear spin-offIt was a huge success, spawning several subsequent sequels, as well as a Buzz Lightyear spin-off.The films in the main series have all set new box office records on release, and combined they have grossed more than £3 billion worldwide, as well as garnering critical acclaim.The original movie received a special achievement Academy Award for having pioneered computer-animated filmmaking, while Toy Story 3 (2010) and Toy Story 4 (2019) both won the Oscar for best animated feature.Toy Story 5 is released in cinemas on 19 June.

    "body": "9 hours agoJen SmithSouth West health correspondentBBCIssy Ferris and Archie Sylvester were told they faced $200,000 (£146,500) of medical bills after their baby was born prematurely in the US despite them being insuredA couple were told they faced a $200,000 (£146,500) medical bill when their baby was born prematurely in the US, despite them having travel insurance which covered her pregnancy.Musicians Issy Ferris, from Cornwall, and Archie Sylvester, from Somerset, who perform as folk duo Ferris & Sylvester, were on tour in Nashville when Issy became unwell with pre-eclampsia.Their baby was born in an American hospital seven weeks early, but the couple said  Zurich Insurance Group refused to uphold the policy and cover their costs because the  baby was not named in the document.After a nine month legal battle, Zurich has reversed its decision and told the BBC it was sorry for the stress caused.Ferris & Sylvester, who live in Frome, had been on a summer tour with their band that included a four-day stint in Nashville.Ferris, who was 33 weeks pregnant with their first child, had been given the all clear for the trip and flight by her midwife and GP. Ferris&SylvesterFolk band and married couple Ferris & Sylvester were on a tour in Nashville\"I was 25. I'd never been ill in my life. It was a big opportunity,\" Ferris explained.\"The advice was, you're perfectly healthy so there's not really a reason not to do it\".Sylvester said the couple \"made 100% sure Issy was insured to be pregnant, and any complications involving pregnancy whilst we were abroad were covered\". \"At least to our understanding - we would never have gone otherwise\", he said.But  the couple said they could never have predicted what would happen after two days in Nashville when Issy developed pre-eclampsia, a life-threatening complication that can affect women in the second half of pregnancy.\"In my case, severe pre-eclampsia can lead to organ failure so it was a really serious situation\" said Ferris.The problems meant the couple's baby boy, Lucky, had to be delivered seven weeks before his due date.\"The consultant came in and said, look this is really serious - you're not going anywhere. Your baby is going to be born in America,\" said Sylvester.Lucky was delivered safely but spent nearly three weeks in intensive care.In the trauma and emotion of that time, Sylvester proposed and the couple were married in a Nashville park.Ferris&SylvesterSylvester proposed in hospital and the couple married in a Nashville park Eventually, mum and baby were deemed well enough to fly home but the couple's happiness was marred by news from the  insurance company.Sylvester explained: \"Essentially what they said is that we would have been covered had the baby not survived. But the fact was  that the baby survived.\"\"We weren't going to be covered for that, because we didn't put his name on the insurance policy.\"Once home in Somerset, their ordeal continued as medical bills started to arrive.\"We thought OK, we're all home, we're all alive,\" Sylvester said. \"But we still have a premature baby, a very small baby that we're taking care of, and we're starting to receive bills in the post from America.\"\"We dreaded going to the post box because eventually the bills racked up, and we realized the extent of the money that we owed - which was over $200,000\".Ferris&SylvesterBaby Lucky was born seven weeks prematureIt took nine months of correspondence and the help of a lawyer before the insurer reversed its decision and said it would cover the family's medical bills and US expenses.\"It was such a relief,\" said Sylvester. \"But it didn't mean that it didn't happen. It seemed irresponsible they were pushing so hard on something that seemed so black and white to us\".Ferris added: \"We still take out the same insurance, because it is the best. You know, it's not something that's like, oh, I wish I'd got out better insurance.\" \"Of course we wish we hadn't gone to Nashville, but we didn't follow bad advice.\"She added:  \"I don't think we've ever sort of lost the feeling that there isn't a wolf at the door\".Ferris&SylvesterThe couple said the trauma of what happened will stay with them \"I don't think we've ever lost the feeling that there isn't a wolf at the door\".A spokesperson for Zurich Insurance Group told the BBC: \"We're deeply sorry for the stress this caused Mr and Mrs Sylvester and baby Lucky during what was already a traumatic experience of pre-eclampsia and a premature birth.\"While Issy's claim was fully covered, questions were initially raised around Lucky's costs because the original policy didn't clearly address births after 32 weeks.\"We've now strengthened and clarified our wording and guidance so other families travelling abroad at this stage of a pregnancy do not have to go through this experience.\"Steve Edwards, head of external affairs and campaigns at the consumer group Which? said the couple's case was not unusual.\"There are many people that are going on holiday expecting their travel insurance to cover them and then finding, in a very traumatic way, that, they're not covered\".\"It's something we've heard a lot and it's one of the reasons we decided to submit a super complaint on the home and travel insurance industry to the regulator – the Financial Conduct Authority.\"Issy and Archie are now back performing as Ferris & Sylvester, and are working with pregnancy charity Tommy's to raise awareness of pre-eclampsia and premature birth.NHS guidance",

The Cardiff Devils fan flew to Milan on Sunday to watch Canada play France in the men's ice hockey. The 27-year-old realised while it would cost him about £125 for the train and football in Conwy county - plus the cost of food and drink - his entire Italy trip would set him back £135.\"It was cheaper than me going to Llandudno to watch Barry Town,\" he said. The only potential glitch in his 24-hour trip was that he had to avoid forking out for a hotel, which could have added an extra £400 to his bill. McAllister, a full-time YouTuber from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, landed in Milan at 11:00 GMT. He said: \"Being at the Winter Olympics was fantastic.\"There were people there from all over, though the two teams playing were heavily represented - there were 5,000 or 6,000 from Canada there. \"It was almost a party-like atmosphere, everyone was very excited, it was a massive event.\"Canada, who were the favourites, beat France 10-2. After the game McAllister, who supported Canada, took in the sights and enjoyed some pizza.John McAllisterHe previously spent more than a month travelling to a football game in KazakhstanIt was not McAllister's first time in Milan - he said he'd visited the \"fantastic\" city a couple of times before. \"Once I was watching football and the other times I was taking a long train to Sicily,\" he said.By 23:00 he was back at the airport where he caught 40 winks before his 06:00 flight the next day.\"I found a corner and put my head down,\" he said, proving that a bargain trip to the Winter Olympics can be done.\"It says a lot about why people don't tend to use public transport in the UK. It costs so much money.\"He has also watched rugby in New Zealand, ice hockey in Canada and football in Singapore.His girlfriend, Beth, does not always join him on his sports trips. \"It's safe to say she thinks I'm slightly mad,\" he said.More top stories",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesBritain is to develop new air defence weapons alongside the EU's four biggest military powers, deepening ties with the European defence sector.The project will invite manufacturers in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Poland to submit plans to build low-cost missiles and autonomous drones. The allies are pledging a speedy process to build the weapons together, inspired by Ukraine's development of cheap drones to counter attacks from Russia.The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) says the programme will prioritise a \"lightweight, affordable\" surface-to-air weapon, with the first project to be delivered by next year. The plan, announced at a meeting of the five countries' defence ministers in the Polish city of Krakow, marks a boost to UK-Europe ties after the failure of talks last year over UK participation in the EU's new €150bn (£130bn) defence fund.Agreement would have allowed British defence companies to play a greater part in joint projects funded by the loans, but negotiations fell apart after the UK rejected a multibillion euro entry fee demanded by the EU.A budget for the latest drone defence plan has not been confirmed, but Defence Minister Luke Pollard told reporters in Poland that each country was making a \"multimillion pound, multimillion euro\" commitment to the scheme.The MoD says it will take inspiration from Ukraine, which has quickly developed a huge domestic drone manufacturing sector since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country four years ago.Huge numbers of low-cost drones have become a key part in defending the country from Russian attacks that can involve hundreds of attack drones, rendering traditional missile defence systems impractical and costly.'Economics of warfare'\"To be effective at shooting down relatively low-cost missiles, drones and other threats facing us, we need to make sure that we're matching the cost of the threat with the cost of defence,\" said Pollard after the meeting.He added that the drone defence plan agreed on Friday would be the first in a series of initiatives from the group of five allies, known as the E5, to change the \"economics of warfare\" amid the threat from Russia.The MoD has not provided a detailed plan for how drones could be developed more quickly, but is pledging to step up co-operation with smaller technology companies and minimise operational requirements for taking part in projects.Europe is under pressure to increase defence spending in the wake of the Ukraine war and questions over the reliability of the United States as a Nato ally.The E5 group, which first met in autumn 2024 after Donald Trump's re-election, has now met seven times and has emerged as a key body for boosting European defence co-operation outside the much larger structures of the EU.Boosting the use of autonomous drones, which can independently identify targets without human control using AI, was a key part of a wide-ranging review of UK military capabilities unveiled in summer last year.That review saw the MoD commit to developing \"more permissive\" regulations for such autonomous systems, in a potential shift away from the position that there should always be \"context-appropriate human involvement\" in weapons.

    "body": "4 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesMajor restaurant chains, including KFC, have ditched a commitment to improve chicken sourcing standards in the UK as poultry demand soars.Eight restaurant groups, which also include the owners of Burger King and Nando's, have left the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC), in which they pledged to stop using fast-growing chickens, for an industry-led plan without that commitment.Animal welfare groups say fast-growing \"franken-chickens\" mature quicker but also have higher rates of premature death and muscle disease.Trade body UKHospitality said the industry-led plan will help restaurant firms reduce emissions and meet surging demand for the lean protein while ensuring secure supply chains.Allen Simpson, CEO of UKHospitality, which represents some of the restaurant brands who have withdrawn from the BCC, said despite the change the businesses are \"committed to enhancing their ongoing work across welfare and the environment\".The eight businesses, owning or franchising 18 leading restaurant chains, have instead joined the industry-led Sustainable Chicken Forum (SCF).Some of the brands include include Popeyes, Wingstop, and Wagamama.The SCF said businesses \"no longer believe the BCC is the right framework to drive the next phase of progress on welfare due to the requirement to source only slower-growing breeds\".It argued that farming slower-growing breeds produce more greenhouse gas emissions than farming faster-growing breeds.UKHospitality said the SCF will focus on increasing welfare while limiting the environmental impact of chicken farming and keeping up with demand.The BBC understands the famous chicken chain owned by Yum Brands buys about 4% of the UK chicken supply. An industry source said there is not yet a large enough supply of slower-growing poultry in the UK.However, animal welfare group Anima International said the change was \"about money and nothing else\".Its UK chief executive Connor Jackson said the companies' explanation for leaving is rubbish.\"Franken-chickens pose the most serious animal welfare problem in the UK,\" Jackson said.He said that chicken farmers and poultry companies would produce more slower-growing, higher-welfare chickens according to orders.\"This is why the supply isn't there for them now: producers won't do it unless they have a contract in place because they are more expensive,\" he said.Claire Williams, campaigns manager at The Humane League UK, said it was clear to her animal welfare group why the chicken outlets had switched membership. \"Major food companies, with the combined worth of many billions of pounds, have decided that their profit margins cannot be threatened,\" Williams said.\"The Better Chicken Commitment was designed by scientists to help animals - the Sustainable Chicken Forum is a welfare-washing, PR-stunt designed to deflect criticism, and let these companies claim they are doing enough\".Richard Griffiths, head of the British Poultry Council, which represents poultry breeders and processors, said the news was \"most welcome\".He said that at a time of higher production costs and slow planning approvals the industry did not need added costs.Retailers such as M&S and Waitrose and cafe chains Pret and Greggs remain members of the BCC.",

    "body": "1 hour agoRichard Wheeler,political reporterandNick Eardley,political correspondentGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was pictured wearing Order of the Garter robes at his brother's coronation in 2023The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession, the BBC understands.The move, which would prevent Mountbatten-Windsor from ever becoming King, would come after the police investigation has concluded.The King's brother remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", last October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.On Friday unmarked police cars and vans were seen coming and going at Royal Lodge, the 30-room Windsor property where Andrew lived for many years.At one point more than 20 vehicles could be seen parked at the property, although it is not known it all was connected to the investigation and searches.Thames Valley Police, the force which arrested him, is expected to continue searching Royal Lodge until Monday, the BBC understands.The government's proposal comes after some MPs, including the Liberal Democrats and SNP, signalled their support for such legislation.Some Labour parliamentarians who have been critical of the monarchy told the BBC they were less convinced the move was required - in part because it is so unlikely the former Duke of York would ever get near to the throne.In October, Downing Street said it had no plans to introduce a law to change the line of succession. The move would require an act of Parliament, which would have to be approved by MPs and peers and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.It would also need to be supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where Charles III is head of state, including Canada, Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand.The last time the line of succession was changed by an act of Parliament was in 2013, when the Succession to the Crown Act restored individuals who had previously been excluded because they had married a Catholic.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said police should be \"allowed to get on with their job, acting without fear or favour\".He added: \"But clearly this is an issue that Parliament is going to have to consider when the time is right, naturally the monarchy will want to make sure he can never become King.\"The SNP would support removing Andrew from the line of succession if legislation is required, according to the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn.Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, has also backed the move.She said: \"I would support legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession and to remove from the counsellor of state.\"Counsellors of state can stand in for a monarch who is ill or overseas although, in practice, only working royals are expected to be called upon to fulfil those duties. Mountbatten-Windsor stepped back from public duties in 2019 following a backlash after an interview with BBC Newsnight about his relationship with Epstein.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said \"all of us in public life need to give space\" to the police investigation to be carried out.

    "body": "Do Liverpool fans think Slot is under pressure?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arne Slot was added to the banner above - created by the Irish Kop website - before the 2025-26 seasonByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalist and Ellie ThomasonBBC Sport Senior JournalistArne Slot has already cemented his place in Liverpool history.The 47-year-old Reds manager is one of the iconic faces on a banner displayed on the Kop before every home game, alongside Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish, Rafael Benitez and Jurgen Klopp - Liverpool managers who have won either a top-flight title or European Cup.After winning the Premier League in his first season, and spending almost £450m on a new-look squad in the summer, it seemed as though Slot was going to carry on in the same fashion this season.They started their title defence with five straight wins - albeit leaving it late at times - but have now gone over a month without a Premier League victory.They sit seventh in the table, seven points behind leaders Arsenal, and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, losing 3-0 at home to Crystal Palace.After six defeats in their past seven games, BBC Sport spoke to Liverpool fans to find out what's going on this season and how they feel towards the manager.'We are losing patience'Slot's squad selection for Wednesday's EFL Cup defeat by Crystal Palace sparked huge debate.He made 10 changes from Liverpool's last outing, handing out two debuts and naming three teenagers in his starting line-up, plus a further five among his substitutes.The likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo, Florian Wirtz, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike were all absent as the Reds made a tame exit in a competition they have won twice in the past four seasons.Liverpool fan Abigail Rudkin told BBC Sport she is disappointed by Slot's decision-making.\"Walking to the game last night, me and my dad got the team sheet and we were like 'he's sacrificed this',\" she said. \"I understand we are losing games at the moment but you need to try and get a winning mentality back.\"We are losing patience. I think there are two different sides of the fanbase at the minute. \"There are those on social media that are calling on him to lose his job, and there are the people I see at the ground, like me, who are losing patience going to these games and not enjoying it as much with losing the games, but they also want to stay patient with him because we are very grateful to him for what we've had from last season when we thought it would all fall apart without Jurgen Klopp.\"Jordan Chamberlain from Empire of the Kop said he will forgive Slot's team selection on Wednesday if Liverpool beat Aston Villa on Saturday.\"This is the one that matters,\" he said. \"Then Real Madrid and Manchester City. If we get three negative results in the next week, then Slot's job will be genuinely under threat.\"But to suggest he should lose his job on the back of a match [against Palace, in which] he fielded players many fans haven't heard of is ludicrous. \"Slot's been very poor and has made some horrible tactical choices this season that have restricted his best players and left us wide open. We've also had some bad luck and missed too many chances. It's football. He deserves time to turn it around and I back him to do so.\"Fellow fan Ryan agreed it's \"way too soon\" to be talking about getting rid of Slot, but said players need to take responsibility and shoulder some of the blame too.\"We don't turn into a bad team overnight,\" he said. \"But Slot doesn't help himself with some of his decisions - and that is what he can control.\"Liverpool operate differently and I can't see us cutting Slot and his staff so soon. However, results are what count, ultimately, and if things don't improve - and quickly - then we all know how the road ends.\"The players have to step up too, by the way - it shouldn't all be on the manager. Some have been way, way below an acceptable standard for Liverpool.\"'More than footballing reasons behind slump'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jota had two years remaining on his Liverpool contract when he diedLiverpool fan Josh Sexton - who contributes to The Anfield Wrap - told BBC Sport there are a multitude of reasons why this season's form has been suffering.\"Key players are out of form, a few players are struggling for fitness, or suffering from injury issues, and there is a lack of continuity from last season,\" he said.\"A lot of those continuity issues stem from the business done in the summer, most of which was necessary for one reason or another and I don't think many Liverpool fans would look back and say that they regret the departures of any players besides possibly Luis Diaz and the profile of the player that Trent Alexander-Arnold is - the emotion attached to that exit causes this supporter to not miss the man himself as such.\"The variable within all of this is that one player we lost in the summer was lost in the most tragic of circumstances very unexpectedly, and there are more reasons than just footballing ones why that loss is absolutely immeasurable.\"Sexton said the emotions of Mohamed Salah after Liverpool's first game against Bournemouth showed how Diogo Jota's death has impacted not only the players who were his team-mates, but also the new arrivals, who have come into a dressing room that has been hit hard by the loss of a close friend.\"The tributes from within the club and from the supporters serve as a constant celebration of the magnificent human being that we were lucky enough to call one of our own, but of course they can also stir up feelings of grief and loss which can't be easy to perform through at an elite level,\" he added.\"And yet that is exactly what Liverpool have to do with the target on their back as Premier League champions, and I've not noticed any drop in heads or performance per se when those vocal tributes have been paid (the song the fans sing in Jota's memory actually started later than 20 minutes against Manchester United as Cody Gakpo went through on goal and hit the post).\"It will no doubt be having a general impact, but we'd all do well to remember everybody has their own grieving process and give each other the leeway to carry on despite such an unspeakable tragedy.\"'Always going to be a tough season'Earlier this month Liverpool captain Van Dijk addressed the fact that the club was mourning the death of Jota, who died in a car crash in July.\"It was always going to be a tough season,\" he said after a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on 4 October.\"Nobody said that it was going to be plain sailing whatsoever.\"It was always going to be ups and downs for multiple reasons that we shouldn't forget, and all we have to do is stick together.\"Speaking on Radio 5 Live on Wednesday night, former Liverpool full-back Stephen Warnock said: \"You've got a team that's mourning in that changing room. How do the new players integrate into that? It's a horrible situation.\"It has to have an effect. They are human beings.\"One thing I notice every time I come to Anfield or watch Liverpool play is the Diogo Jota song after 20 minutes goes up and there is a 5-10 min spell where the tempo drops completely.\"The players are hearing that song and your mind will wander in that moment to one of their friends and close colleagues. In the changing room his locker is still there, so you're sat with a constant reminder of that person you've lost and that can't be easy. \"Some people will be able to put that to one side but for some it will weigh really heavy on their shoulders.\"Just a lull, or time for change?Media caption, Fans react as Liverpool lose againWe asked if it is too soon to talk about Slot's job being under threat, or if change should not be ruled out.Here are some of your comments:Paschal: Just a lull Liverpool are going through. Slot will turn it around. Just a matter of putting the players in positions they are comfortable and happy to play in. Time to put Joe Gomez at right-back and give him a chance. Let the new players have time to settle in. Patience is needed - it will come right.James: If Slot can't turn things around quickly then his position does need consideration. You can't make the financial commitment Liverpool have made and not see results. People continually mention transition and bedding in, but top, top players should hit the ground running - likewise managers.Karl: He should be given more time. We aren't a knee-jerk reaction team. Everyone is still dealing with the loss of Diogo Jota, and then adding so many new players into the mix. He is still the right man for the job.Barry: Lose the next three and I honestly feel something has to done before we fall too far behind for even a top-four spot.Paul: To suggest Slot is in trouble would be akin to saying last season never happened! We are not, and never have been, a 'sacking club'. We leave desperation to others. The guy has earned a year at least to sort this new team out. The talent is clearly there, but they haven't clicked yet. Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.Terry: Not sure Slot is the right man to get us out of trouble. We spent so much money on players and he doesn't seem to know how to play them. I think he's under pressure now, he needs to win games soon or he's gone.",

    "body": "Is this the beginning of the rise of the machines?Last week saw AI triumph outright for the first time in our Premier League predictions battle, although BBC Sport's own expert human, Chris Sutton, points out he is still top of the overall league this season.This time, as well as AI, Sutton faces a different hi-tech challenger. His guest opponent for this weekend's fixtures is a computer game: Football Manager 26, the latest edition of the long-running management simulation series.The FM26 game engine has played out this weekend's matches and you can see its results, including goalscorers and red cards, below.Miles Jacobson, the studio director of Sports Interactive, the company behind Football Manager, also joined in.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, FM26Image caption, FM26 has a database of more than 750,000 players and staff, created with the help of more than 1,500 researchers around the worldFM26 is released next week and, for the first time, allows people to manage across men's and women's teams as this edition includes a women's football database featuring more than 36,000 players.There are some tactical innovations too, including the ability to pick a different formation for your team depending on whether you are in or out of possession, but the rise of set-pieces in the Premier League this season is something that has already been part of the game for a while.Jacobson told BBC Sport: \"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is using some of the things Tony Pulis used to do with set-pieces, by having a set-piece coach to come up with ideas.\"But set-piece coaches are something that have been in FM for a while, and we have regular conversations with quite a few of them about things they are looking at.\"At the moment, long throws have become fashionable again, but will it last if people start doing defensive training to deal with them?\"With the prevalence of set-piece coaches, it is something that won't necessarily negate itself over time, but clubs seeking advantages will always be looking at the past as well as the future for ways to innovate.\"That's what we're seeing this season - one of the reasons the Premier League table is all over the place at the moment is because people are looking for those marginal gains, which is something people try to do constantly inside FM too.\"Chris Sutton and Miles Jacobson were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.FM26's Premier League predictions, including goalscorers and red cardsPremier League predictionsSaturday, 1 NovemberAmex Stadium, 15:00 BSTLeeds have made a great start and I am pleased for Daniel Farke. He took a lot of stick when he was at Norwich, when I kept hearing how he wasn't a Premier League manager, but apart from their heavy defeat at leaders Arsenal, his side have been competitive in all of their games so far.I am still going with a Brighton win here, though. The Seagulls did not play well when they lost at Manchester United last weekend, then went out of the Carabao Cup at the hands of the Gunners on Wednesday, but they are unbeaten at home so far and I am expecting them to bounce back.Sutton's prediction: 2-0FM26's prediction: 1-1Miles' prediction: Leeds are doing better than expected but I'm still going for a Brighton win. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1Turf Moor, 15:00 BSTArsenal know how to win games in so many different ways, and that puts them in an unbelievably strong position.They have got flair players, but also have this amazing record of scoring from set-pieces and are strong defensively too.We talk about machines when I go up against AI or a computer game at predictions but, let's face it, Arsenal are a machine at the moment and no-one is stopping them.There have been prettier Gunners teams than this, but they are just so effective and they don't concede.That's why we might see a fair few results where it is '1-0 to the Arsenal' - as their old song under George Graham in the 1990s used to go - but when they hit the straps there will still be games where they take teams apart.Like the other promoted teams, Burnley have been really competitive and ran Liverpool and Manchester City close earlier in the season, despite losing on both occasions.The Clarets' late win at Wolves last week was a massive result for them and it really takes the pressure off them here. You don't get many free hits in the Premier League but this is one of them - Burnley are probably not going to get anything out of this game, but it doesn't matter too much.I am expecting Scott Parker's side to be robust, keep it close, and stay in the game, which is a sign of where they are at... but Arsenal will still win - and you can probably guess what score I am going for.Sutton's prediction: 0-1FM26's prediction: 1-2Miles' prediction: Like Leeds, Burnley have done better than I thought they would, but there's a reason Arsenal are unbeaten for such a long time. 1-2AI's prediction: 0-3Selhurst Park, 15:00 BSTThese teams are next to each other in mid-table and it feels like they have both made positive starts to the season - they also both progressed in the Carabao Cup in midweek.There were a lot of doubters when Keith Andrews succeeded Thomas Frank as Brentford boss - about Andrews himself and also how the team would do without Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa - but they have coped admirably.The Bees are a very good counter-attacking team, so it is going to be fascinating to see how they get on against a Crystal Palace side who can be awesome on the break.Sutton's prediction: 1-0FM26's prediction: 0-0Miles' prediction: It's an interesting transition for Brentford to go from Frank to Andrews in his first managerial role but he is doing well. They have kept quite a few of the old backroom staff and the system they have got in place at the club is more owner-driven than most clubs. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Craven Cottage, 15:00 BSTThis is massive, for both teams.Wolves thumped Fulham here last season, winning 4-1 in one of Gary O'Neil's final games in charge before Vitor Pereira took over - and boy how Pereira could do with a similar result this time too.It doesn't get much worse for a manager than arguing with your own fans, which is what happened after Wolves lost to Burnley last time out, and Pereira's side are bottom without a league win this season.Fulham are on an awful run too, suffering four straight defeats. They haven't always played too badly, but you can just sense the confidence sapping out of them.Wolves' problem is they are conceding too many - currently their average is more than two goals a game - and I don't think you can stay in the Premier League doing that.Pereira shored things up when he first came in - O'Neil's Wolves conceded 40 from their 16 league games last season before Pereira took charge, then only let in 21 goals in their next 16 under him.That's what he has to do again, but it is clear they have not replaced the players they sold in the summer with the same quality, and there is no sign he will stop them leaking goals.This is the sort of game where I actually fancy both teams to lose but I am going to back Fulham to edge it at home.Sutton's prediction: 2-1FM26's prediction: 0-1Miles' prediction: Wolves actually did all right in the Carabao Cup this week despite losing 4-3 to Chelsea - I know that wasn't their full first-team but they have shown glimpses of what they can do in the past few weeks too. They would probably settle for a draw here, and so would Fulham. 2-2AI's prediction: 2-1City Ground, 15:00 BSTThe Nottingham Forest fans seem to be happy with Sean Dyche as manager and I think they will be patient with him - he has that affiliation with the club after starting his playing career there.I think they might have to wait a bit longer for his first Premier League win, though.Manchester United have picked up a bit, and Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are proving me right after I said in the summer they would prove to be great signings.They bring great variation when they play together - Mbeumo runs in behind, while Cunha comes deep looking for the ball to feet - and they both link the attack so well.Defensively, there are still problems with United, however.They have put together a three-game winning streak but they are not at the stage where I trust them to turn up every week, and I can see that run coming to an end here.Sutton's prediction: 1-1FM26's prediction: 1-2Miles' prediction: Sean Dyche will be trying to tighten things up at Forest a little bit, but United are on a roll. 0-1AI's prediction: 1-2Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:30 BSTThis is always a bit of a grudge game because the two sets of fans don't really like each other.Chelsea need the result more, and they also have a much better record in this fixture, but their home defeat against Sunderland was another example of how flaky they are at the moment.Tottenham have made the better start to the season, but it still feels like there is more to come from them when their injured players come back - which won't happen this week.I don't really know which way to go with my prediction, so I am going to for a draw. I feel like I am turning into AI.Sutton's prediction: 1-1FM26's prediction: 1-1Miles' prediction: Tottenham have a lot of injury problems going into this one, while Chelsea have a few disciplinary problems. I'm hoping for a good game. 2-2AI's prediction: 2-2Anfield, 20:00 BSTLiverpool boss Arne Slot made a lot of changes for Wednesday's Carabao Cup defeat by Crystal Palace but it still felt like another damaging defeat, their sixth in the past seven games.Slot's side play Real Madrid and Manchester City after this, and they desperately need to end this slump in form before it gets any worse.He rested players against Palace for this weekend, so he knows how important it is, but on current form, Aston Villa are favourites - they have won their past four league games and are on a roll.Looking at both teams over the past few weeks you would expect Villa to get something here, but I need to use all my knowledge to get the better of AI.So, with this game I am going to base my prediction on something that I thought about when I was a player - history.Villa have taken only one point from their past seven visits to Anfield, and have won only one of their past 15 league games against Liverpool - although that was a 7-2 success in October 2020.I had my bogey teams - most of them felt like that by the end to be honest - and I don't think AI will understand that part of the game (Sutton does not know anyone else's predictions when he makes his).So, I am going with Liverpool to win, with Mohamed Salah getting a hat-trick.Sutton's prediction: 3-1FM26's prediction: 3-1Miles' prediction: In-form Villa versus out-of-form Liverpool... but they have to come back into form at some point. I just want a goal from Florian Wirtz because I've got him in my Fantasy Premier League team. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Sunday, 2 NovemberLondon Stadium, 14:00 BSTNewcastle marched on in the Carabao Cup in midweek and, after winning it last season and ending their long wait for silverware, I am starting to think about whether Eddie Howe can get his hands on another trophy.West Ham, in contrast, are in deep trouble. Nuno Espirito Santo had a free week to work on things on the training ground but whoever he picks, it doesn't seem to make much difference.The Hammers concede a lot of goals from set-plays and I feel as if Newcastle are going to just be too strong for them in every area.Sutton's prediction: 0-2FM26's prediction: 2-1Miles' prediction: I feel like both teams should be doing better in the Premier League, but especially West Ham. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-2Etihad Stadium, 16:30 BSTI mentioned history earlier, and Manchester City have won all eight of their home Premier League games against Bournemouth since 2015, scoring 31 goals and conceding five, but I still don't think anyone will be overly confident they will beat the Cherries this time.City are so reliant on their big number nine and their big goalkeeper this season, and that has to change. They need other players to step up.It also feels like a mistake for Pep Guardiola to ignore the rise in the importance in set-pieces - City are the only Premier League team not to score from one this season. He says he wants to focus on creating more chances in open play but it is proven that corners and throw-ins work, so my advice to Pep is that maybe it is time for him to get some big players in, and launch it!I am tempted to go for Bournemouth to get at least a draw here because they will cut through City and get some chances, but instead I am going to be brave and back Erling Haaland and City, mainly because they are at home but also because they have Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal.Bournemouth will score but City will win. I have got Cherries keeper Djordje Petrovic in my Fantasy team at the moment, so I need to move him out.Sutton's prediction: 3-1FM26's prediction: 3-2Miles' prediction: Bournemouth are absolutely flying and have all the confidence in the world. If you look at their bench, they have got some incredible players that aren't getting to start at the moment. It's a really interesting journey they are on at the moment, and we will have to wait to see if they can keep it up. Given their form, and City's, I am going for an exciting draw. 2-2AI's prediction: 3-0Monday, 3 NovemberStadium of Light, 20:00 BSTI am torn here. I am always wrong about Sunderland and I know that means I have got a large fanbase on Wearside.Because of that, I don't want to jinx the Black Cats by saying they will win... but it is also hard to make a case for Everton getting anything.My 606 co-host Roman Kemp said their Hill-Dickinson Stadium will be a fortress for them this season, but Tottenham didn't have too much trouble there last Sunday with a 3-0 win.David Moyes' side really need to respond after that defeat but what he needs more than anything as he goes back to one of his former clubs is a finisher.Beto misses so many chances, but I am backing him to put his boots on the right feet this week and score to grab his side a point.Sutton's prediction: 1-1FM26's prediction: 0-4Miles' prediction: Everton have lost their last two games and Sunderland are looking strong at home, but Oliver and Paul Collyer, who are the founders of Sports Interactive, are massive Everton fans and I would not live it down if I went for a Sunderland win. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-1How did Sutton do last week?Chris got four correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 games played in week nine, giving him 70 points.That was enough for him to beat his guest, The Charlatans guitarist Mark Collins, who got three correct results with one exact score, for a tally of 60 points.The BBC readers did better, with five correct results, including three exact scores, leaving them on 140 points, and they took the contest to the final game of the weekend - Tottenham's 3-0 win at Everton.AI was the only predictor to back Spurs, going for a 1-0 away victory, which meant it ended up with six correct results and three exact scores, and a winning total of 150 points.\"I'm still top of the league and that's what counts,\" said Sutton. \"The machines are not taking over yet.\"Weekly wins, ties and total points after week nineWinsTiesPointsChris30630Guests21585You20780AI11670Source: Guest leaderboard 2025-26PointsJames Skelly190James Walsh110Addison from JJFC100You *87Rod Jones80AI *74Kid Wild& Chris Sutton *70Mark Collins& Tommy Longhurst60Blanco, Orlando Bloom,Theo Ellis & Tom Grennan50Aya from JJC30Katherine Parlour10* Average after nine weeksSource: BBC",

    "body": "20 minutes agoWill Grant,BBC's Mexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent, Kingston and Brandon DrenonAt least 19 people have died in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa, Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon has said, as search and rescue efforts continue and authorities try to get aid to hard-hit areas.The hurricane, one of the most powerful to strike the Caribbean, has also killed at least 30 people in Haiti, officials said.In Jamaica, \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,\" Dixon said, adding there are \"devastating\" scenes in western regions.Electricity remains out to most of the island and as people try to salvage damaged homes and belongings from floodwaters and mud, many thousands are growing increasingly desperate for aid.There are parts of the country that have been without water for several days and food is growing increasingly scarce.Aid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly with the main airport in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, largely back to normal. But smaller regional airports, some of which are located near to where humanitarian assistance is most needed, remain only partly operational.As such, aid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston via road, many of which remain unpassable in places.Satellite imagery shows nearly all buildings in some Jamaican villages have been destroyed by the hurricane. Residents of towns in western Jamaica told the BBC on Thursday that \"words can't explain how devastating\" the storm has been on the country.\"No one is able to get through to their loved ones,\" Trevor 'Zyanigh' Whyte told the BBC from the town of White House in Westmoreland parish. \"Everyone is just, you know, completely disconnected... Every tree is on the road, right, so you can't get too far with the cars, not even a bicycle,\" he said.In Haiti, many of the victims in the storm died when a river overflowed in Petit-Goave. A full assessment is ongoing, as there are still areas that authorities have not been able to access.Around 15,000 people were staying in more than 120 shelters in Haiti, interim UN co-ordinator for the country Gregoire Goodstein said.In Cuba, more than 3 million people were \"exposed to life-threatening conditions\" during the hurricane, with 735,000 people \"safely evacuated\", according to the UN's resident co-ordinator for Cuba Francisco Pichon.No fatalities have been reported so far in Cuba, but almost 240 communities have been cut off due to flooding and landslides, Cuban authorities said.Hurricane Melissa made landfall on Tuesday in Jamaica as a category five storm, packing winds of up to 185 mph (295 km/h), before impacting other countries in the Caribbean.Governments, humanitarian organisations and individuals around the world are pledging support for the nations hardest hit by the storm.The World Food Programme said it is collaborating with partners to coordinate logistics, cash and emergency supplies across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.The US State Department said it is deploying a disaster response team to the region to help with search and rescue operations, and assisting in efforts to provide food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits and temporary shelters.The UK government on Friday said it is mobilising an additional £5m ($6m) to send humanitarian supplies, including shelter kits and solar powered lanterns, to help people without power and whose homes have been damaged.That is on top of £2.5m ($3.36m) already announced in emergency humanitarian funding to support recovery in the Caribbean.The Foreign Office is also preparing flights to evacuate British nationals unable to come home on commercial flights.While Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti assessed the damage left in Melissa's wake, Bermuda braced for impact.The Bermuda Weather Service expected Melissa to be a category two hurricane when it passed the British overseas territory on Thursday night.Government offices in Bermuda will close until Friday afternoon and all schools will shut on Friday.\"Until the official 'All Clear' is issued, residents are urged to stay off the roads so Government work crews can safely assess and clear debris,\" a public alert from the government said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoChris VallanceSenior technology reporterGetty ImagesPornhub says the number of UK visitors to its website is down 77% compared with July, when more rigorous age checks for sexually explicit sites were introduced under the Online Safety Act.It claims sites that are ignoring the new requirements are benefiting.The BBC has not been able to independently verify Pornhub's claim - however, data from Google shows searches for the site have decreased by almost half since the law came into effect.This could be a consequence of people reducing their porn use but could also be partly explained by people visiting the site through alternative means such as a VPN, which masks a user's location.Pornhub is the most visited porn site in the world - and the 19th most visited on the entire web, according to data from Similarweb.Under the OSA, anyone accessing such websites in the UK now has to prove they are over 18 with age checks such as facial identification.The firm's claim is the latest indication that people in the UK are changing how they use the internet since the Online Safety Act came into effect. According to Ofcom, visits to pornography sites in general in the UK have reduced by almost a third in the three months since 25 July.The regulator said the new law was fulfilling its primary purpose of stopping children from being able to \"easily stumble across porn without searching for it\".\"Our new rules end the era of an age-blind internet, when many sites and apps have undertaken no meaningful checks to see if children were using their services,\" the watchdog said.Ofcom told the BBC it believed the number of people using VPNs for general use reached 1.5 million daily in July, after the law came in, but has since decreased to around one million.Meanwhile, research by Cybernews counted more than 10.7 million downloads of VPN apps in the UK from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store across 2025.\"It is likely that people not wanting to verify their age or identity to access sexual content, for example because of privacy concerns, are using VPNs to get around this,\" Dr Hanne Stegeman from the University of Exeter told the BBC. \"As the location of website visitors are usually determined through IP addresses, it could be that those figures are inaccurate when a portion of visitors are using VPNs.\"And Cybernews information security researcher Aras Nazarovas told the BBC people in the UK \"can and do\" use VPNs. \"After age checks kicked in, VPN apps jumped to the top of the UK App Store, and at least one provider saw a 1,800% surge in downloads,\" he said.\"So part of Pornhub's 'missing' UK audience hasn't vanished - it's being reclassified as non‑UK traffic.\"But he said he believed \"the rest\" was indeed \"users shifting to sites that don't require age checks\".'Exponential growth'Age verification 'insurmountable task' - Pornhub execAlex Kekesi, an executive at Pornhub's parent company Aylo, told the BBC the new rules were unenforceable.She said Ofcom faced an \"insurmountable task\" trying to get an estimated 240,000 adult platforms - visited by eight million users per month in the UK - to follow the rules.This compares with the regulator taking action against fewer than 70 sites for non-compliance.Ofcom says it prioritises sites to be investigated based on how risky they are and their number of users.And Ms Kekesi claimed some pornographic sites have benefited from flouting the rules. The BBC has not independently verified this.\"There are a number of sites whose traffic has grown exponentially, and these are sites that are not complying,\" she said.Ms Kekesi also has concerns about the content on some of these sites.She told the BBC of one which seemed to encourage users to search for content featuring girls below the age of consent.Aylo says it has shared details of this and other sites with Ofcom.The regulator has defended the way it enforces the new rules, saying increasing traffic to sites can be one factor that triggers an investigation.\"Sites that don't comply and put children at risk can expect to face enforcement action,\" it told BBC News.Ofcom's data shows that the top 10 most popular sites all have age assurance deployed. These sites represent a quarter of all visits to adult sites from across the UK.It adds that over three quarters of daily traffic to the top 100 most popular sites are going to sites that have age assurance.The government has also defended the regulator, and said protecting children online was a \"top priority\" for ministers.\"Where evidence shows further intervention is needed to protect children, we will not hesitate to act,\" it added in a statement.Should devices do the checks?Ms Kekesi spoke to the BBC while in the UK for a meeting with Ofcom and government officials, where she has been making Pornhub's case that age checks should be done at device level, rather than by individual websites.She said the UK stands out in having persuaded the platform to introduce age checks.A number of jurisdictions have sought to compel Pornhub to check its users' ages, but the response of the site has been to block users rather than comply.Ms Kekesi said the UK was different because it allowed sites to offer a range of different solutions, meaning that Pornhub could use methods - such as email-based checks - which didn't require collecting biometric data.She denied that the threat of hefty fines for non-compliance had been the primary motive for complying, pointing to the contrast with France - its second biggest market - where it had cut off access rather than agreeing to what regulators demanded.Ian Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association rejected calls for a switch to device-based verification.But he added the group shared a desire for a \"level playing field\" meaning age checks should be \"robust, not superficial or fake\". Chelsea Jarvie, a cybersecurity company founder who has been researching methods of age assurance for a PhD at Strathclyde University, told the BBC both approaches to age checks would be needed - with neither age verification on platforms nor devices being a \"silver bullet\".\"For somebody to truly be safe online we need different layers of controls throughout their browsing journey,\" she said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesAfter weeks, months, years and even decades of scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed. There are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.Unlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself. It's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.The sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.Titles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.All that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.After more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.Sandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.It makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.'He's just Andrew. She'd be so proud,' say Giuffre's familyLive: Giuffre's brother calls for further investigationKing's statement on Andrew in fullWhat we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionWatch: Question Time audience reacts to Andrew newsThis announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.But it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.Polling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.And the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"Watch: Moment King gets heckled about Prince AndrewFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years, the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.The unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.Andrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.A few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.BBC NewsnightPrince Andrew pictured during his Newsnight interview in 2019There might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story, people might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.What remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.Who knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?But this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King. While other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.There seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged, showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.It no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.Instead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.It's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.",

    "body": "7 hours agoHelen BushbyCulture reporter BBC/Studio LambertJoe Marler [L] with Cat Burns and David Olusoga enjoyed being round a table without having to vote anyone offSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from the eighth episode of The Celebrity TraitorsParting may have been sweet sorrow for young lovers Romeo and Juliet, but when Shakespeare's famous line is uttered by traitor Alan Carr, it's more like murderous Macbeth.He has struck in plain sight - again - killing off Claudia's \"Queen of the Castle\", Celia Imrie, by quoting the bard while pouring her a goblet of wine at a lavish dinner. \"Oh honestly, just because I was brave enough to get one traitor out,\" Imrie said when she learned her fate, referencing them FINALLY getting rid of Jonathan Ross. Imrie's demise was indeed a sombre moment for all concerned. \"I love being here, it's been gorgeous and I'm devastated. I so wanted to stay to the end, but it's a game,\" she said sadly.After learning it was Imrie's last supper, the burly Joe Marler became emotional, saying: \"My darling Celia is gone. My heart is broken. I'm sick of this - they are taking out some lovely, lovely people.\"I'm not having it any more.\"But as Ed Gamble pointed out in BBC Two's Celebrity Traitors Uncloaked, Imrie's demise was ripe for humour as well.Her accidental fart in episode three was the gift that kept giving. \"Farting is such sweet sorrow,\" he said to her, in a line worthy of Shakespeare himself, who also enjoyed contrasting dramatic moments with bursts of humour.BBC/Studio LambertCelia Imrie and Alan Carr were sat dangerously close to each other at the mealCarr clearly got a taste for murder as the series progressed, bumping off Paloma Faith in plain sight and handing Lucy Beaumont her death warrant. But this time round, his conscience re-emerged, and he found it \"heartbreaking\".\"I'm really hoping third time's a charm,\" he said, trying to convince himself he still had it in him to keep going.Host Claudia Winkleman was rattled by Imrie's murder, declaring: \"I love her\", as she stalked out of the breakfast room clutching her portrait. Perhaps not surprisingly, Carr later looked a bit edgy about the upcoming round table, telling Cat Burns his Shakepearean moment was \"so obvious\". \"I'm so nervous, what do we do if everyone goes for me today,\" he said.\"I just hope no one puts two and two together with the the eggy Shakespeare quote.\"Later on, the contestants had to put their doubts and suspicions aside for the day's challenge - in a creepy room full of headless dummies, which needed their Celebrity Traitor heads reattached. Easy enough - except our celebrities had to navigate through a fiendish array of red laser beams, all pointing at awkward angles, meaning the most nimble had the easiest time of it.BBC/Studio LambertThe celebrity heads had to be reattached to their bodiesNick Mohammed turned out to be something of a twinkle toes, making it through with relative ease. But Marler struggled more, saying: \"I'm not one of the nimble, agile rugby players\" and called himself a bit of an \"oil rig\". Carr, noting that Claire Balding's head \"looked like Boris Johnson\", decided to carry Imrie across first, saying: \"I took Celia's head because I missed her - even though I murdered her, but I had pangs of guilt!\"He later took his own, admitting: \"I grabbed my own head, I'm a narcissist… well someone's got to love it!\"After a nail-biting finish, the celebs managed to complete the task, earning Claudia's praise, including a surprising accolade.\"Thank you, you were amazing. That was better than my wedding day,\" she said. BBC/Studio LambertAlan Carr was less than complimentary about Claire Balding's plastic headAfter all the camaraderie of the challenge, it was then even harder for the contestants to face the round table, where with just six of them left, everyone felt exposed.Burns was hoping she hadn't \"given them enough to cling on to\", while Kate Garraway was uncharacteristically bullish. \"I'm going to fight to the death,\" she said.There was plenty of fighting talk from Marler too, who looked like he was going to name and shame Carr and vote for him. But he ended up voting for Garraway, saying she came across as a \"dipsy damsel\", but was perhaps \"smarter than you've made out\". She was voted off - and yet another faithful bit the dust. She gave a touching speech as she departed, referencing the death of her husband, political lobbyist and therapist Derek Draper. Draper died last year after living with extreme complications after getting Covid during the pandemic.\"I've had a lot of years of being very serious and very sad, and you've all allowed me to play the most amazing game,\" she said. \"But also you've allowed me to play and be silly and have fun. Every single one of you. \"I'm going to take away a new idea at the start of a new kind of life really, so thank you very much for that.\"BBC/Studio LambertKate Garraway thanked everyone for helping her consider a new start in her lifeDavid Olusoga also got a couple of votes, including one from Carr, who managed to mostly lie low during the discussion, along with Burns.Or so they thought. Marler is onto them, convinced they're both traitors, and is now rallying Mohammed and Olusoga to back him as they go into the final. \"I'm hoping to get really close to Alan and Cat so they keep me in the game, and then I can try and pull the rug from under their feet last minute,\" he said. \"Sorry traitors, I'm coming for you.\"There was a telling moment right near the end of the show, when each remaining contestant had to look the others in the eye and tell them they were a faithful. Carr couldn't manage it without dissolving into a fit of giggles. One X user called it \"the TV moment of the year\". \"I am a faithful, I just get nervous,\" he explained. It was all he could do not to break into a sweat.  \"Yeah, I'm not having it,\" muttered Marler, who will no doubt tackle the traitors head on in next week’s final. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe government has been urged to get a grip on long A&E waits with campaigners saying it is the rot eating away at the heart of the NHS.The plea by Age UK comes as it publishes a report detailing \"heartbreaking\" stories of how older people are suffering, spending hours in corridors and side-rooms.It highlights cases of people being left in their own excrement, having blood transfusions and even dying in these make-shift treatment areas.And it said older people were much more likely to experience long waits, with data showing one in three over 90s attending A&E in England last year faced a 12-hour wait or more.The government said the situation was unacceptable, but added it was taking action.The Age UK report said while 12-hour waits were once virtually unheard of, they had now become the norm in too many places.It highlighted the case of an 86-year-old who was left in a disused corridor for 36 hours.Another man, who had soiled himself, was left in his own excrement for 20 hours, while others suffered the indignity of having to use bedpans in corridors.Susan, 79, from south London, is one of those who has experienced a long wait, according to the Age UK report.She said it took 22 hours for a bed to be found for her after she arrived at hospital having had a heart attack.She spent a large part of her wait on a couch in a curtained-off area near A&E where there was no privacy. She believes she heard two people dying on couches nearby.Regarding one of the deaths, she said: \"I was next to a man who was clearly unwell. He was alone for some time, then his wife was brought in. They whispered as they had little privacy. Then, after a long silence, she was led away, crying. I'm certain he died. And he died right next to me.\"The report pointed to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from NHS England which showed there were more than 1.7 million 12-hour waits in 2024-25 at major hospitals – around one in 10 of those who attended A&Es.Two thirds of them were experienced by people aged over 60.The report said as well as being horrible, long waits were risky.Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said it was a \"crisis hiding in plain sight\" and that the government should take immediate action.\"No-one should have to spend their final days in a hospital corridor where it's impossible for staff to provide good, compassionate care.\"As we head into winter, we fear that an already difficult situation will get worse.\"Long waits are like a rot eating away at the heart of the NHS, undermining public trust.\"Age UK said a major cause of the problem was the lack of available support in the community, which meant hospitals could not discharge patients who are medically-fit to leave wards. That results in a shortage of beds available for new patients.It called for a renewed effort and drive to tackle this.RCN general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger said the problems were a \"moral stain\" on the health service.\"No elderly or vulnerable person should be forced to endure these conditions. \"Overstretched and understaffed nursing teams work hard every day to deliver the best care, but they face an impossible task.\"Health minister Karin Smyth said: \"No one should receive care in a corridor - it's unacceptable, undignified and we are determined to end it.\"She said the government was investing more money in the NHS and detailed data on corridor care would soon be published to hold the system to account.\"To tackle a problem you've got to be honest about it,\" she added.",

    "body": "8 hours agoEmily HoltBBCWe've all looked at our bank account and wondered why we don't have as much money as we thought we did, and suddenly, the bills, shopping and socialising begin to add up.For many of us, our relationship with money is strained and dealing with financial matters leaves us feeling overwhelmed or stressed.If you're struggling to get on top of your finances, here are four ways to help you manage your money better. 1. Look at when you spend moneyGetty ImagesSitting down and thinking about what actually drives you to spend money can help you stop destructive patterns, says  journalist and author Anniki Sommerville.When she previously worked in a very stressful corporate role, she bought new clothes everytime she achieved something difficult or challenging.\"I felt like I deserved to reward myself.\"I had this pattern of spending, which was like 'you've done a really good presentation, now you deserve to buy yourself something.'\"Abigail Foster, a chartered accountant and author, says the easiest way to discover these kinds of habits is looking through your bank statements, to see when you spend the most.\"Is it late at night? Is it the weekends? I have friends that have really bad habits of when they're bored on the train, they start buying things.\"Understanding these instincts, enables us to put in steps to prevent them. \"You can be better equipped to make an alternative decision and go, 'Do you know what? I can just take a deep breath and not purchase something.'\"2. Spend an hour a week on your financesGetty ImagesAnniki says when she was younger, she often felt scared to check her bank balance and avoided dealing with money as much as possible.This kind of behaviour is often linked to our education, says Claer Barrett, consumer editor at the Financial Times.\"How we felt about maths in school, maybe that burning feeling of shame of not knowing the answer or putting your hand up to answer a question and getting it wrong, that can often make us feel like, I can't do maths. So therefore, I can't do money.\"\"We should be really pushing on that door and trying to understand more about our financial situation.\"Abigail says the only way to do this is to force yourself to tackle it head on, setting aside a set amount of time each week to look at your bank account and all your outgoings.\"It's a minimum of an hour a week. \"Just go through your finances and kind of be hit with it. It sounds a lot, but it can be really calming for your nervous system.\"Doing this will often throw up outgoings that you've forgotten, such as a subscription for a gym you haven't been to in six months or a random app you've forgotten you've subscribed to, she says.3. Don't let jargon put you off - ask questionsGetty ImagesOften the terms associated with money can be offputting. Claer says don't let words like investing, scare you, instead take time to learn about them. \"Whether we're talking about stocks and shares, or investing in a pension. We need to give ourselves every advantage financially,\" she says. \"So being shy or feeling shameful, not asking these interrogating questions is the worst thing we can do.\"She suggests making a list of things you are unsure about, whether that's consolidating pensions or asking for a pay rise at work, and slowly working through them. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're just starting. \"We're all a work in progress. I've got my financial to do list at the back of my diary. There are some things that have been on it for more than a year.\"That's just life, but as long as I can try and do something every week towards making my financial situation a better place, that's moving forward.\"4. Set up a freedom fund Getty ImagesMany of us are already too stretched keeping up with the costs of everday living to even think about saving.  But for those who can afford to, Abigail suggests setting up a  \"freedom fund\" to give you options when life gets difficult.She recommends setting up an easy access account only in your name and not joint, and to put a portion of your income away every month.Unlike an emergency fund pot for things like unexpected car and house repairs, a freedom fund is money designed to \"make you happier.\"\"So when a job no longer serves you, you can think 'I've got some money sat away so I can go and look for something else.'\"Or if you want to leave a partner, that freedom fund can give you the ability to walk out.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "2 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterWatch: Zarah Sultana asked about her new party's name and valuesZarah Sultana has said her new left-wing political party founded with Jeremy Corbyn is aiming at \"running\" the government despite high-profile splits emerging in the movement.The Coventry South MP left the Labour Party in July to form a new group, operating under the temporary name Your Party, which she said was a \"40-year project\" and not a protest.Her comments follow a difficult start for the party - which has attracted hundreds of thousands of sign-ups - but has been dominated by rows over leadership, finances and even its name.Speaking to BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, the MP said she wanted to \"change people's lives for the better\", which requires \"winning state power\".The new movement will be \"socialist, democratic and member-led\", Sultana told the BBC.And if elected, it would focus on \"nationalising, building council homes, providing people with good secure jobs\".She added: \"I'm in politics because of a desire to change people's lives for the better, and that means winning state power, that means actually running government.\"We're building a party of the left that can win power and deliver justice.\"She added: \"This is a 10, 20, 30-year project.\"In the four months since the fledgling party was announced it has been beset by disagreements and threats of legal challenges between the founding members.Sultana's interview came after three officials quit the board of MoU Operations Ltd (MoU) - set up to overseeing Your Party's finances and membership - saying they were leaving her as the sole director.The resignations follow reports the party is still trying to recover around £800,000 in donations and data held by MoU.The problems stem from a schism in the party caused when Sultana launched a membership portal through its official email account, taking payment and data from an alleged 20,000 people. Corbyn branded the emails \"unauthorised\" and urged supporters to cancel direct debits.The membership portal was later replaced,  but not before the dispute escalated into legal threats and accusations of a \"sexist boys' club\".The pair have since reconciled.Sultana has pushed for the party to be called The Left Party, while Corbyn hinted the name Your Party could stay. Members will vote on the official name at a founding conference in Liverpool next month.Sultana said she hopes to co-lead the new party with Corbyn, but will \"throw her hat in the ring\" if members opt for a single leader when the party constitution is agreed at conference. During the interview, Sultana accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of having \"all the features of a fascist politician\".\"I have legitimate concerns about what a Nigel Farage government would do to trade unionists, to working class communities, to minority communities, to LGBT people,\" she said.\"When someone attacks trade union rights, when they are not supportive of minority communities, when they try to get us out of the European Convention on Human Rights so they can get away with anything, that is a descent into fascism,\" she said.A surge in support that has seen Reform UK opening up a 10-point lead in national polls reflects a wider crisis in politics, driven by voters left \"angry\" by years of austerity, she said.Reform UK have been contacted for a response.In order to \"stop Reform,\" Sultana said her new party will work with a resurgent Green Party.Asked whether she would join the Greens, Sultana said she liked new leader Zack Polanski \"but we are a different party\".\"There will be those alliances and those electoral pacts in the future,\" she added.Asked if her movement would split the left and take votes away form the traditional centre left voting base of Labour, Sultana said Labour \"probably should have worried about that before it enabled genocide and passed through austerity\".\"The Labour party actually was quite content because it thought the left had nowhere else to go - and now the left has choices.\"You can listen to the interview with Zarah Sultana on the latest episode of Political Thinking with Nick Robinson on Saturday at 17:30 on BBC Radio 4 or on BBC Sounds.",

    "body": "£420 million bill cut for heavy industry as union attacks 'obscene' energy profits8 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editor  and Michael Sheils McNamee,Business reporterPA MediaBusiness Secretary Peter Kyle visited Encirc Glass in Chester, one of the businesses set to benefit from lower billsBills for some of the country's most intensive business energy users will be cut by £420m from next year, the government has said. Speaking to the BBC, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said about 500 businesses in industries including steel, glass and cement would benefit from a 90% discount on their electricity network charges - up from 60%. Unite's secretary general Sharon Graham said she welcomed help with costs, but  the amount saved would be \"quite small\" and that profits made by energy providers were \"obscene\".It comes less than a month from the Budget, with the government facing questions about how it can unleash growth, while keeping its commitments on employment rights. Last year, the UK's energy costs were the highest in the G7 group of developed nations. For the same year, the International Energy Agency reported that UK industrial energy costs were almost double the average across its members.Speaking to the BBC at Encirc Glass in Chester, Peter Kyle said the funding was aimed at \"levelling the playing field\" with international competitors, and that the bill reduction would be paid for through existing government tax revenue.  \"The savings we have made for it, we have targeted to make businesses like this more competitive, so therefore creating more jobs, more wealth, more revenue for our country,\" he said. The scheme is applicable across England, Wales, and Scotland, and some of the companies which will benefit from the change include Tata Steel at Port Talbot,  and INEOS in the Scottish town of Grangemouth. The reduction is on network costs, which are what businesses pay to access the UK's electricity network, and make up about 20% of a company's energy bill - meaning a 90% reduction works out at about 18% of the overall energy bill. Reacting, UK Steel said the uplift in compensation was \"greatly welcomed\" - but that it would only mean a cut of £14m for the beleaguered industry and firms wouldn't see the benefit until payments were made in arrears in 2027.\"It is frustrating that the steel industry must face yet another year of uncompetitive electricity prices,\" said UK Steel's director general Gareth Stace.  'It's complete toffee'Speaking to the BBC at Unite's head office in London, its secretary general Sharon Graham said employers told her they were competitive on \"every single measure\", with the exception of industrial energy costs.Research carried out by Unite, which has more than 1.1 million members, found that £30bn in profit was made in the UK's energy sector in 2024 -  while industrial energy bills are made up of about 29% energy company profits. Its research also looked at the breakdown for domestic bills.   Roughly a third of what a household pays on energy bills in a year - about £500 - goes towards energy company profits, Graham said, urging the government to nationalise the industry. This is a suggestion opponents criticise for its potentially enormous cost.\"You know, this argument that keeps coming up, 'oh, it will take us down the road of Liz Truss' - is just complete toffee,\" said Ms Graham.\"The reality is, what Liz Truss did is that she borrowed for tax cuts for the rich, and she didn't have a plan that she put before the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility].\"'More holes than Swiss cheese'While the action on energy bills will provide some relief for heavy industry, there are broader concerns in the business community about the impact of the Employment Rights Bill. One of Labour's flagship policies, it is currently making its way through Parliament and would give workers certain rights from their first day of work.These would include protection against unfair dismissal and the right to guaranteed hours - which businesses say could potentially make it riskier to hire someone. The Federation of Small Business has said nine out of 10 of its members are worried about the bill, with two thirds saying they would recruit less staff in response to it. Even the Resolution Foundation, the progressive think tank seen as having deep ties within the government, has cautioned the bill would \"inhibit hiring\" with \"little obvious gain to workers\".Peter Kyle said he did not see improved rights of workers as being \"in contention with\" the interests of business. He said it would be implemented in a way that would contribute \"towards the ability for businesses to make money by increasing productivity, by having workers that have security and rights that are fit for the age that we live in\".However, he added he was \"listening very closely\" to employers and workers \"to make sure there's a probationary period that gets that balance right\".For Sharon Graham, the legislation as it stands is \"a burnt out shell\". \"I think I said at one point it had more holes than Swiss cheese,\" she said.\"The reason that I said that, is that what looks good when you first look at it - and I've been a negotiator for 35 years, so I do look under the bonnet - fire and rehire [is] banned.\"But then what you realise that is, in most circumstances, if an employer said there was financial difficulty, if a council says there's financial difficulty, then they can fire and rehire you.\"",

It is also understood that he did not object to the King's decision to remove his titles.His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

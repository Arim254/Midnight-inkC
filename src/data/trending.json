    "body": "The World Cup draw is here - this is how it will workImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington DC has been chosen for the World Cup draw, though the city will not host any matchesByFootball issues correspondentPots, quadrants, confederation constraints, group position grids... the 2026 World Cup finals draw on Friday is not going to be a straightforward affair.  There's a lot to unpack so we're going to explain it as simply as we can.Luckily, Fifa will have a computer to do most of the heavy lifting and make sure everything runs smoothly. Though as Uefa found out in 2021, sometimes technology does go wrong. Let's hope there will be no gremlins in Washington once the draw ceremony kicks off.Here is how it will work, what to expect and a few key things to look out for. When will draw start and how long will it take?Media caption, Dan Roan reports from Washington before the 2026 World Cup drawThe ceremony gets started at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time) on 5 December, but there's going to be far more to this glitzy event than simply pulling the countries out of a hat. Supermodel Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor and producer Danny Ramirez will co-host.Before the draw there will be live music performances from Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger, while Fifa president Gianni Infantino and US President Donald Trump are both expected to make speeches.Then it is on to video clips of the finalists, introductions and the draw itself.Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand will conduct the draw.The 47-year-old will be joined by broadcaster Samantha Johnson and a host of sporting greats, including Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal.Once the draw has been completed, the Village People will perform YMCA to bring the curtain down, with the entire ceremony expected to last about 90 minutes.How has Fifa seeded the draw?The 48 teams have been placed into four pots of 12 based primarily on Fifa world rankings.The exceptions are the three hosts who are automatically in pot one, and the teams who will qualify through the six play-off paths, who go into pot four.Given some of the teams involved in the four European play-off paths, they have the potential to create some strong groups.Italy and Denmark would have been in pot two because of their world rankings had they qualified directly, while Wales would have been in pot three.The six play-off paths are:Uefa Play-off A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern IrelandUefa Play-off B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania, SwedenUefa Play-off C: Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo, RomaniaUefa Play-off D: Denmark, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland, North MacedoniaFifa Play-off 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New CaledoniaFifa Play-off 2: Iraq, Bolivia, SurinameHow will the draw work?The 12 groups will include one team from each of the four pots.Fifa will start by drawing the teams from pot one.Co-hosts Mexico (A1), Canada (B1) and the United States (D1) will have coloured balls with their flags on to denote their special status. Their group positions are pre-determined to make sure they play all their games in their own countries.The draw will then continue with pots two, three and four in order.What is this about the top four teams being kept apart?Fifa's big idea is to set up the best chance of blockbuster ties in the latter stages of the World Cup. So for the first time it is giving special seeding status to the top four in the world rankings - Spain, Argentina, France and England.Crucially, this status will only apply if the countries win their groups. Let's take a look at how it will work, using England as our example.Each of the four countries will be drawn into a group in a different coloured quadrant of the bracket, as shown in the image below. Spain (ranked 1) and Argentina (2) must be in opposite halves and cannot meet until the final, likewise France (3) and England (4). France and England would not be able to meet either Spain or Argentina until the semi-finals. Let's say that France come out first and go into Group C, placing them into the green quadrant on the right side of the draw. That means England can only go into the blue or turquoise quadrants on the left side, groups E, F, G, H or I.If Argentina then drop into the blue quadrant, that further restricts England only to turquoise - groups G or H.    Are the four seeds being given an easy ride? Not necessarily.Each quadrant has a potential last-16 tie between two group winners. For instance, the blue quadrant has a meeting of the winners of Group E and Group I. That means a seeded team could meet another pot one side, let's say perhaps Brazil.Being drawn into groups C, F, H or J looks potentially more favourable, as it is not possible to play another group winner until the quarter-finals.If one of the four seeded teams finishes as group runners-up, then they lose the ranking privilege. So if England were to finish second in Group H, they would move out of turquoise and into red - perhaps meeting Spain, Argentina or France as the winners of Group J in the first knockout round.Image source, FifaImage caption, If Spain, Argentina, France and England win their groups they will slot into separate quadrants for the knockout bracketWhat are the draw restrictions to watch out for?There can be no more than one team from the same confederation per group. So, for instance, Brazil and Uruguay (Conmebol) cannot be in the same group, nor can Panama and the United States (Concacaf). There is an exception for Uefa because there are 16 teams and only 12 groups. That means four groups will contain two European nations. It all seems relatively straightforward, but as we go on these constraints are going to cause some serious complications as countries skip groups to avoid clashes with teams from their own confederation. That means it will not just be case of teams slotting into Group A, and then Group B, and then Group C in order as they are drawn. When we get to pots three and four, it might seem like countries are being sent to random groups. Fifa needs to prevent something called deadlocking, which happens when it is no longer possible to complete the draw while following the regulations.  The major issue comes from the teams who can potentially qualify via the inter-confederation play-off pathways and will go into pot four. Pathway 1 has New Caledonia (OFC), Jamaica (Concacaf) and DR Congo (CAF)Pathway 2 has Bolivia (Conmebol), Suriname (Concacaf) and Iraq (AFC)Both pathways have a Concacaf team, so they are automatically blocked out of four groups (those containing the United States, Mexico, Canada and Panama). The first pathway is less of problem, because the only other Oceania team, New Zealand, are also in pot four. But the second pathway makes it complicated, because there are 17 deadlocking nations in pots one, two and three. So, the only way to complete the draw is for the team that qualifies via this route to go into a group with two European countries and an African nation.What will this look like in practice?When pot two is being drawn, the computer will have to ensure that there is at least one group with two European teams, or one European and one African country.When it comes to pot three, there will then be two possible draw routes. If there is one group with two European nations in it, then Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia or Ivory Coast must join it. If there is one group with an African and European nation in it, then Norway or Scotland must go into it. Both could happen, in which case the draw computer will ensure one is filled as necessary. If we get to pot four and there is only one group which meets this criterion, pathway two will have to go into it.The other pot-four teams - the four potential play-off winners from Uefa, two from Concacaf, two African and one Asian nation - will have their own deadlock restrictions. The Uefa play-off paths, which include Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, will have limited options because 12 European teams will already have been drawn.   It might be hard to keep up at this point. How will teams be allocated to their groups?Once a team has been drawn they will go into the first available group, adhering to the draw constraints, in alphabetical order. The draw computer will ensure Spain, Argentina, France and England are placed in groups in the correct quadrant of the bracket.To speed up the process countries will not be drawn into their specific group positions to set the order of the fixtures.Seeded countries will all go into position one, with a pre-determined grid for all the other pots, as shown in the image below.For instance, let's take Scotland in pot three. Their fixture order will be determined by the yellow box.If they are drawn first from pot three they will go into Group A with Mexico. The grid shows the team from pot three will go into position two. The first match is A1 v A2, so Mexico would play Scotland in the opening game of the World Cup.Image source, FifaImage caption, The group position by pot has been pre-determined and will not be decided by drawWhen will teams find out when and where they will play?While nations will know their opponents and match dates on Friday, 5 December they will have to wait 24 hours to find out venues and kick-off times.The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations and already have venues for the fixtures, but not kick-off times.For all other groups, you'll know only the date and the order of matches when Fifa unveils the match schedule in a live broadcast on Saturday, 6 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). Fifa president Gianni Infantino will be joined on stage by legends of the game to discuss the key matches.All 12 groups will play fixtures in this order:Match Day 1: 1 v 2, 3 v 4Match Day 2: 1 v 3, 4 v 2Match Day 3: 4 v 1, 2 v 3",

    "body": "Just nowMinisters are attempting to broker a deal with the EU and other countries to give frozen Russian assets in the UK worth £8bn to Ukraine, reports the Times.  The paper says they are also warning Vladimir Putin is an \"active threat to the UK's citizens, security and prosperity\". A photo of Israeli Eurovision singer Yuval Raphael is splashed across the paper after the competition was \"hit by boycotts\" from several nations over the inclusion of Israel.The Guardian focuses on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage who it says \"turned on broadcasters\" for questioning him about racist and antisemitic comments he is alleged to have made as a teenager. The politician gave an \"angry performance\" at a press conference, vowing to boycott ITV and the BBC - and also pointing out the networks had shown homophobic and racist content themselves in the 1970s and 1980s. Farage has denied the claims against him and the Guardian says Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice called the former classmates liars.For the Daily Mail, \"Farage's 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' attack on BBC double standards\" is in the lead. The Reform UK leader said the corporation should issue an apology for broadcasting the programme and others if it wanted to apply the standards of today to the 1970s. Reform UK have been thrust into the \"fundraising lead\" reports the Financial Times after an expat entrepreneur's record £9m gift. The paper also snaps Russian President Vladimir Putin in a car with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the pair met in New Delhi at the start of a two-day summit.Ex-Masterchef host John Torode is \"in therapy over TV axe\" reads the headline of the Sun. He says he is suffering from \"grief\" after being fired from the show when an allegation of racism against him was upheld. Torode has denied the allegations.There are \"fears of worst flu wave to strike NHS this winter\" says the Daily Express. Experts have urged people to get a jab, it adds. The paper also features a photo of England cricketer Joe Root who has scored a century in the Ashes. \"Even Australia will have to admit he's a great now,\" it writes.The Daily Star also headlines on Joe Root's cricketing success with \"not out\" after he \"saves fans from Oz legend's balls\". \"Dawn's blood on his hands\" leads the Daily Mirror after an inquiry found Russian President Vladimir Putin to be \"morally responsible\" for the death of Dawn Sturgess. The \"Russian tyrant ordered his assassins to attack\" British agent Sergei Skripal writes the Mirror, before \"recklessly\" discarding the perfume bottle containing the poison that ultimately killed the mother-of-three in Salisbury.\"Putin personally ordered novichok attack on Salisbury\" headlines the Independent, also reporting on the conclusion of the inquiry. The attack was intended to show \"Russian power\", the paper quotes the author of the review, retired Supreme Court judge Anthony Hughes, as saying. In a snap of Joe root, the Indy asks if England can \"stage an Ashes comeback?\"For the Daily Telegraph, David Lammy has broken \"ranks\" on Brexit as it says the deputy prime minister refused to rule out reversing the UK's withdrawal from the EU process seven times. The Telegraph dubs Putin and Modi \"brothers in arms\" sharing the same picture as the FT on its front.  Calling Labour the \"party of welfare\" is \"ignorant\", Labour's Liz Kendall has said in an exclusive for the i Paper. The chair of the government's child poverty taskforce said \"we're the party that backs kids and their future\". The i dubs Joe Root \"the GOAT\" for \"finally\" getting his Ashes ton.Metro dubs the Lake District the \"Quake District\" after a 3.3 magnitude tremor left locals and tourists \"quaking with fear\".Related Internet Links",

Mr Bashir was earlier charged with terrorism offences that are not directly related to the attack.Frank Ferguson, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was sufficient evidence to charge Mr Bashir with one offence of preparation of terrorist acts and three offences of sharing terrorist publications with Al-Shamie and others with the intent to encourage acts of terrorism.FacebookPolice say Mr Bashir took Al-Shamie, pictured, to an unnamed military baseAssistant Chief Constable Rob Potts, who holds operational responsibility for Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the charges were not directly related to the synagogue attack \"but come as a result of enquiries conducted by our investigation team\".Chief Constable Potts said the investigation into the attack \"remains live\" and urged anyone with information to come forward.Mr Bashir is set to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has warned again that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war in Ukraine.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he told India Today. Moscow controls around 85% of Donbas.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.Putin's comments come after President Donald Trump said his negotiators discussing a US peace plan believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after Tuesday's talks in Moscow.Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who was in Moscow, is due to meet Ukraine's team in Florida.Trump said Tuesday's talks in the Kremlin were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin - but the Witkoff team presented a modified version in Moscow.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said he had not seen the new version before his talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" the Kremlin leader said.He also said Moscow disagreed with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said straight after the talks that they produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stalling any ceasefire agreements, saying Moscow is seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.Commenting on the Kremlin talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia said  Putin was \"wasting the world's time\".Ukraine has long insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\" - but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.The Ukrainian president said last week his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during talks with an American delegation in Geneva on 23 November.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said at the time that they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city last week, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.In a statement to the BBC, the White House said: \"Secretary [Marco] Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr Kushner, and the President's entire national security team are working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine.\"\"They have held productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable, enforceable peace,\" the statement read.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHelen BushbyCulture reporterThe Duke of Sussex appeared to joke about US President Donald Trump in an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.Prince Harry appeared in a US TV sketch with Colbert, where he auditioned as himself for a \"Christmas prince\" role in a romantic TV film, for the Hallmark Channel. Appearing behind Colbert, the prince joked he was lost  while searching for an audition for the \"Gingerbread Christmas Prince saves Christmas in Nebraska\", and the TV host asked him why a real prince would want to star in such a film.Prince Harry said Americans were \"obsessed\" with Christmas movies and royalty, but when Colbert queried this, the duke replied: \"Really? I hear you elected a king,\" possibly referencing October's \"No Kings\" protests directed at the Trump administration.The protests saw huge crowds taking part in protests against Trump's policies in cities including New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles.Referencing US TV network CBS' recent settlement with Trump, the duke joked he would \"do anything\" to get the part, adding: \"I'll record a self-tape, I'll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House - all the things you people in TV do.\"Colbert replied: \"Hey, I didn't do any of those things,\" to which Harry said: \"Maybe that's why you're cancelled.\"He was referencing The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ending in May 2026 after 33 years on air, in a surprise announcement from CBS in July. The sketch then featured festive trees and sleigh bells ringing, with the duke telling Colbert to \"just believe\".Colbert later told the prince he would give him the role as \"official Late Show prince of Christmas\", to cheers from the crowd.Colbert's other guests were Michael Shannon, who is in the newly released film Nuremberg, and Irish actress and singer Jessie Buckley, who co-stars in the forthcoming film Hamnet with Paul Mescal.This was the prince's second Late Show appearance. In January 2023 he was there to promote his memoir Spare, and that show set a two-year viewership record, making global headlines.The Duchess of Sussex shared the announcement of the prince's latest appearance in a clip on her Instagram story.The duke and duchess moved to California in 2020 after announcing they would step back as \"senior\" royals and work to become financially independent.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyThe Black Death fundamentally altered medieval societyA volcanic eruption around the year 1345 may have set off a chain reaction that unleashed Europe's deadliest pandemic, the Black Death, scientists say.Clues preserved in tree rings suggest the eruption triggered a climate shock and led to a string of events that brought the disease to medieval Europe. Under this scenario, the ash and gases from a volcanic eruption caused extreme drops in temperature and led to poor harvests.To avert famine, populous Italian city states were forced to import grain from areas around the Black Sea - bringing plague-carrying fleas that carried the disease to Europe as well.This \"perfect storm\" of a climate shock, famine and trade offers a reminder of how diseases can emerge and spread in a globalised and warmer world, according to experts.\"Although the coincidence of factors that contributed to the Black Death seems rare, the probability of zoonotic diseases emerging under climate change and translating into pandemics is likely to increase in a globalised world,\" said Dr Ulf Büntgen of the University of Cambridge.He added: \"This is especially relevant given our recent experiences with Covid-19.\" Credit: Ulf BüntgenTree rings from the Spanish Pyrenees point to unusually cold summers in 1345, 1346 and 1347 The Black Death swept across Europe in 1348-49, killing up to half of the population.The disease was caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis spread by wild rodents, such as rats, and fleas.The outbreak is believed to have started in Central Asia, moving around the world through trade.But the precise sequence of events that brought the disease to Europe - killing millions of people – has been pored over by scholars.Now researchers from the University of Cambridge and the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO) in Leipzig have filled in a missing part of the puzzle.They used clues from tree rings and ice cores to examine climatic conditions at the time of the Black Death.Their evidence suggests that volcanic activity around 1345 caused temperatures to drop sharply over consecutive years because of the release of volcanic ash and gases which blocked out some sunlight.This in turn caused crops to fail across the Mediterranean region. To avoid starvation, Italian city states traded with grain producers around the Black Sea, unwittingly enabling the deadly bacterium to gain a foothold in Europe.GettyFleas spread the plague from infected rats to humansDr Martin Bauch, a historian of medieval climate and epidemiology from GWZO, said climatic events met a \"complicated system of food security\" in what amounted to a \"perfect storm\".\"For more than a century, these powerful Italian city states had established long-distance trade routes across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, allowing them to activate a highly efficient system to prevent starvation,\" he said. \"But ultimately, these would inadvertently lead to a far bigger catastrophe.\"The findings are reported in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPA MediaReform UK leader Nigel Farage has accused the BBC of \"double standards\" after being asked about racist and antisemitic comments he is alleged to have made as a teenager.In an earlier BBC interview, the party's deputy leader Richard Tice dismissed the claims from Farage's former classmates as \"made-up twaddle\". Asked if he agreed with his deputy, Farage said the Today programme interview was a \"disgrace\" and demanded the BBC apologise for 1970s TV shows such as \"It Ain't Half Hot Mum\" and the \"The Black and White Minstrel Show,\" which he said were homophobic and racist. The BBC has been contacted for a comment. Last week, Peter Ettedgui, a former Jewish classmate of Farage's, told the BBC Farage had repeatedly said to him \"Hitler was right\" and \"gas them\" when they had been at Dulwich College together in the 1970s and early 1980s.The BBC has also spoken to two former pupils who backed up Mr Ettedgui's accounts. When previously asked about the comments, Farage has said: \"Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, that you can interpret in the modern light of day in some sort of way? Yes.\"\"I've never directly racially abused anybody. No.\"During a press conference on Thursday, Farage was again asked about the accusations and whether he believed his old schoolmates were lying. He first attacked the BBC's Today programme for their interview with Tice, saying it was \"disgraceful\" to frame a question linking himself to dictator Adolf Hitler. He went on to accuse the BBC of \"hypocrisy\" saying: \"At the time I was alleged to have made these remarks, one of your most popular weekly shows was the Black and White Minstrel Show.\"The BBC was very happy to use blackface - not just in the Black and White Minstrels, they did it in It Ain't Half Hot Mum.\"I cannot put up with the double standards of the BBC about what I'm alleged to have said 49 years ago and what you were putting out on mainstream content.\"So I want an apology from the BBC for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 80s.\"The Black and White Minstrel Show, a programme where white performers painted their face black, ran from 1958 to 1978, getting peak audiences of 16 million. Even at the time it was considered offensive with the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination submitting a petition for the show to be axed. Farage also attacked ITV, describing the broadcaster as \"the channel of Bernard Manning\", referring to the comedian often accused of making racist jokes.   During the press conference, Farage said he had received letters from people he was at school with including one former Jewish classmate. Reading out the letter, he said: \"While there was plenty of macho tongue-in-cheek schoolboy banter, it was humour, and yes, sometimes it was offensive... but never with malice.\"I never heard him [Farage] racially abuse anyone.\"If he had, he would have been reported and punished. He wasn't. The news stories are without evidence, except for belatedly, politically dubious recollections from nearly half a century ago.\"Back in the 1970s the culture was very different... especially at Dulwich.\"Lots of boys said things they'd regret today or just laugh at.\"Whilst Nigel stood out, he was neither aggressive nor a racist.\"Responding to Tice's depiction of his claims as 'made-up twaddle', Mr Ettedgui said: \"Well over 20 former Dulwich pupils have now spoken of Farage's vile racist, antisemitic behaviour.\"Each individual piece of testimony has been separately sourced by journalists working for several major news outlets and has been rigorously checked by lawyers.\"All these accounts paint the exact same picture of the teenage Farage. His and Richard Tice's denials today are as offensive as the original abuse.\"A Conservative spokesman said: \"Nigel Farage just called a press conference and used it to rant at journalists over historic allegations of racism and antisemitism - allegations he has just admitted are true.\"Reform's one-man band is in chaos once again.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

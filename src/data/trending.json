    "body": "Scotland's mad for Oasis, Newcastle loves Sam Fender: Music tastes where you live revealed56 minutes agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCOasis are big in Manchester, but even bigger in Scotland. Newcastle is wild for homegrown guitar hero Sam Fender, and Liverpool can't get enough of female pop stars.These are some of the revelations from a breakdown of listening habits on Spotify and YouTube in 2025 in more than a dozen of the UK's biggest cities.Taylor Swift and Drake were the clear winners on Spotify - except in Newcastle, where Fender broke their stranglehold. He was one of several artists to prove particularly popular in their hometown, while there was a clear north-south divide in Oasis's popularity as they reformed.Eminem dominated YouTube in 2025, ahead of the KPop Demon Hunters singers and Ed Sheeran - with Taylor, Drake and other pop giants also among the most played artists.But a number of surprises emerged from the lists, too. Here are the rankings for each of the featured cities:BelfastGetty ImagesLady Gaga's songs were played a million times in Belfast in 2025There's a lot of love for Lady Gaga in Northern Ireland's capital - she was the second most popular artist of 2025 on YouTube in Belfast, higher than in any other UK city.She was pipped to number one by the stars of KPop Demon Hunters, with Eminem in third. The rapper missed YouTube's top spot in just two of the 14 featured cities (the other being Nottingham).Belfast's most played artists on YouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaEminemTaylor SwiftBruno MarsEd SheeranRihannaSabrina CarpenterCalvin HarrisEJAESurprise package: Belfast trance producer Billy Gillies was just outside the top 10, in 12th, and had two tracks in the city's top 20 songs of the year on YouTube - DNA (Loving You) at 10 and Right Here All Along at 17.NB Spotify did not provide data for Belfast.BirminghamWireImage/Getty imagesThe Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Chris Brown are all big in BirminghamDrake is the most-played artist on Spotify in Birmingham, and it is the only place outside London to also have his rival Kendrick Lamar in its top five.Brummie fans are the most devoted to US R&B singer Chris Brown - it's the only place to put him in its top 10 on Spotify (at nine), and also gives him his highest YouTube placing (at eight).D-Block Europe are big in Birmingham, too - the London-based hip-hop duo are second only to Eminem on the list of the year's most-played artists on YouTube, and it's also the only city to have them in its Spotify top 20 (at 15).Birmingham's most played artists on Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestRihannaBillie EilishChris BrownSZABirmingham's most played artists on YouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeAlka YagnikEd SheeranDrakeKaran AujlaArijit SinghChris BrownKPop Demon Hunters castRihannaSurprise packages: A string of Indian singers are bigger than many Western superstars on YouTube in Birmingham - Alka Yagnik was the third most popular act of 2025 overall with more than 7.5 million views in the city (above Ed Sheeran and Drake).Shake It To The Max by Ghanaian singer Moliy and Jamaican producer Silent Addy was also massive - it was the third most viewed track of the year on YouTube, higher than in any of the other featured locations.BristolGetty Images for The Recording AcademyOlivia Dean's highest rating outside London The tastes of fans on Spotify and YouTube differ a lot, judging by their charts. As in many cities, Taylor Swift was most popular on Spotify in Bristol, while Eminem topped the YouTube list.Bristol's listeners are, according to these rankings, the biggest fans of Olivia Dean outside her home city London, placing her ninth on the Spotify chart.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOlivia DeanAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndBillie EilishEJAESurprise package: It's the only place with any of BTS star Jung Kook's songs in the top 20 Spotify tracks, and he has two (3D at number 13 and Seven at number 18).CardiffGetty Images/Netflix/Getty Images for iHeartRadioEminem, KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran topped Cardiff's YouTube chartAs well as being number one on YouTube, Eminem was more popular on Spotify in the Welsh capital than in any other city, in ninth.Ed Sheeran is third on YouTube, behind KPop Demon Hunters, and also has his highest Spotify ranking, in 11th in Cardiff.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaBillie EilishEminemTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaD-Block EuropeThe WeekndChris BrownSurprise package: It was big everywhere, but Benson Boone's Beautiful Things had its joint highest ranking on YouTube in Cardiff (in third), and the city was the only place to put the song in its Spotify top 10 tracks (at 10) in 2025.EdinburghGetty ImagesOasis, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan were all popular in Scotland's capitalAs Oasis reunion fever gripped the nation last year, Scotland went particularly mad fer it. The band were in the top five most-played acts on both Spotify and YouTube in both Edinburgh and Glasgow - higher than anywhere else, including their home city of Manchester.Edinburgh also likes its pop - it's the only city with Chappell Roan in its top 10 on Spotify, while superstar DJ David Guetta was higher on YouTube than anywhere else. Edinburgh and Glasgow are also the only cities to put Gracie Abrams in their Spotify top 20s.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarChappell RoanThe WeekndTate McRaeYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranOasisKPop Demon Hunters castDavid GuettaRihannaBruno MarsLinkin ParkSurprise package: Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding 2015 cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence was just outside the top 10 most played songs on YouTube (in 11th).GlasgowGetty Images for ABA/Getty Images for SpotifyUS star Zach Bryan and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris proved popular in GlasgowTaylor Swift reigns on Spotify (again), while Glasgow gives Tate McRae her highest placing.It's also the only city where Scotland's superstar DJ Calvin Harris makes it into both the YouTube (11th) and Spotify (18th) lists.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestKendrick LamarZach BryanTate McRaeThe WeekndRihannaYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftKPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaOasisEd SheeranBruno MarsRihannaSabrina CarpenterDavid GuettaSurprise package: Scotland, it seems, is keen on country music - Glasgow is the only place with US superstar Zach Bryan in its Spotify top 10. Edinburgh is the only other UK city with him in its top 20, in 14th place.LeedsGetty Images for Live Nation/RedfernsBillie Eilish and D-Block Europe are among the most popular stars in Leeds, as elsewhereIn the absence of their own home town heroes (sorry Kaiser Chiefs), Leeds listeners are big on other northern acts - it's the only place outside Newcastle to have Sam Fender and the only place outside Sheffield to have the Arctic Monkeys in the Spotify top 10 (Oasis are also not far behind in 14th).Over on YouTube, D-Block Europe are big in Leeds - second to Eminem overall - their joint highest placing, alongside Birmingham.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestRihannaKendrick LamarArctic MonkeysSam FenderYouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeEd SheeranKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsDrakeThe WeekndSurprise packages: Chrystal's infectious The Days was a big hit, but nowhere bigger than in Leeds, where it was the third most played song of the year on YouTube with a million plays - closely followed by her collaboration with MK, Dior, at number four.LiverpoolWireImage via Getty ImagesSkye Newman performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool in MayLiverpool fans can't get enough of female pop stars, judging by these lists. Taylor Swift is top on Spotify, while Billie Eilish gets her joint highest position in fourth, and Ariana Grande gets her highest at number nine.Just outside the top 10, it's also Lady Gaga's joint highest Spotify placing (at 11) and Lana Del Rey's best position of any UK city (at 12).Meanwhile, rising British star Skye Newman was particularly popular on YouTube in Liverpool. She had two songs in the platform's top tracks of 2025 - Family Matters at eight and Hairdresser at 20.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaAriana GrandeTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranMazza L20RihannaCalvin HarrisThe WeekndSurprise package: Liverpool rapper Mazza L20 has crashed the YouTube top 10 in his home city above some global superstars. Real name Malcolm Graham, he was jailed in 2016 for possessing a handgun, before gaining attention online with viral hits like Murdaside.LondonWireImage/Parkwood via Getty ImagesJustin Bieber and Beyoncé only rated on the captial's listTaylor Swift was the most-played artist on Spotify in the UK overall, but Drake beat her to number one in the capital, while Olivia Dean and SZA were also more popular than the national average.Meanwhile, London was the only city to put Justin Bieber and Beyoncé in the Spotify top 20 (19th and 20th respectively).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestBillie EilishOlivia DeanSZAAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemArijit SinghEd SheeranDrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndD-Block EuropeBruno MarsLady GagaChris BrownSurprise package: Arijit Singh, one of India's biggest playback singers, was the second most popular musician of the year on YouTube in London. Singh, who released a duet with Ed Sheeran last year, racked up more than 40 million views in the capital, where he headlined a show at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in September.ManchesterHans Lucas via AFPThe Oasis reunion tour included five sold-out shows in Heaton Park, ManchesterBehind the big North American beasts (led by Drake and Taylor Swift, again), Manchester's (arguably) favourite musical sons Oasis were on repeat in their home city, being the fifth most played act overall on Spotify.That's their highest placing except for the Scottish cities - but the Gallagher brothers were absent from the lists in the south of England (London, Bristol and Southampton).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarRihannaEminemYouTube:EminemEd SheeranD-Block EuropeDrakeTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsThe WeekndArijit SinghSurprise package: The surprise is that Manchester seemingly went less KPop Demon Hunters crazy than elsewhere - the cast are absent from the top 10 YouTube artists (at 12th), and smash hit Golden only makes eighth, its lowest placing in any of the YouTube top songs charts.NewcastlePA MediaSam Fender has performed four stadium shows at the home of Newcastle United FC - two in 2023 and another two in 2025Tyneside's local hero Sam Fender isn't just big in the north-east, he's absolutely massive. The \"Geordie Springsteen\" played two huge hometown shows at St James' Park last summer and was the second most played artist on Spotify, behind the unmovable Taylor Swift. Beside Swift, he's the only person to have beaten Drake anywhere.What's more, Fender has four songs in Newcastle's top 20 Spotify tracks of the year - People Watching (number two), Seventeen Going Under (11), Arm's Length (15) and Hypersonic Missiles (16). None of his songs made the top 20 anywhere else.Spotify:Taylor SwiftSam FenderDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestBillie EilishRihannaKendrick LamarOlivia DeanYouTube:EminemEd SheeranLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsDavid GuettaLinkin ParkD-Block EuropeSurprise package: Scottish dance producer Blair Muir's track Rehab hasn't troubled the main UK charts, but was the 10th most played song of the year on YouTube in Newcastle.NottinghamGetty Images/NetflixBruno Mars and Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys was popular on YouTube, while  SZA made the Spotify listNottingham loves KPop Demon Hunters - the film's cast kept Eminem off the YouTube number one spot. The rap legend is a lowly third, behind Bruno Mars.Meanwhile on Spotify, fans in Nottingham were the only listeners outside London, Birmingham and Manchester to have played Drake more than Taylor Swift, and gave SZA her highest placing beyond London.Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaSZATate McRaeYouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsEminemEd SheeranLady GagaRihannaDrakeD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSurprise package: This is the only city to have preferred Soda Pop by Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys to Golden by their rivals Huntr/x, judging by their YouTube play counts. Soda Pop was second on Nottingham's list of most-played songs, with Golden fourth.SheffieldMyles Wright/ZUMA Press Wire via AlamyThe Arctic Monkeys last performed in Sheffield on June 9 and 10, 2023, with two headline homecoming gigs at Hillsborough ParkArctic Monkeys are another act to get a big hometown boost, coming fourth on the most-played list on Spotify, despite not having released an album or played live for a couple of years.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterArctic MonkeysThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOasisYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftRihannaThe WeekndDenon ReedSurprise package: Birmingham producer and DJ Denon Reed, who is \"leading the revival of bassline\", is in the top 10 most played acts on YouTube in Sheffield - the only city where he features.SouthamptonWireImage via Getty imagesSouthampton is the only city with Coldplay in its Spotify top 10, and also the only place with Bruno Mars in the service's top 20 (at 19).Billie Eilish gets her joint highest Spotify ranking in Southampton, along with Liverpool. And it's one of only two cities to have her in their YouTube top 10, along with Bristol. She's big in port cities, clearly.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaTate McRaeColdplayYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndLinkin ParkBillie EilishSurprise package: Reformed rap-metal behemoths Linkin Park are at nine on the YouTube list, their joint highest ranking (along with Newcastle).And the UK overall...

    "body": "1 hour agoMany of Sunday's papers continue their coverage of the fallout from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest on Thursday over suspicion of misconduct in public office. The Sunday Mirror leads with claims from the Royal Family's former head of protection that \"there was a conspiracy of silence\" over the former prince's relationship with disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Such claims prompted calls for an inquiry to discern \"who knew what and when?\" the paper writes.The ex-Royal's protection chief's \"calls to question 'silence' over Andrew scandal\" also leads the Sunday People.The Observer leads with a zoomed-in photograph of Andrew leaving the police station earlier this week, under the headline of \"nowhere to hide\" and \"monarchy in peril\". Former prime minister Gordon Brown \"demands civil servants face questions over taxpayer-funded flights\" used by Andrew to meet Epstein during his time as a \"trade envoy between 2001 and 2011\", the Sunday Telegraph reports. Brown wrote letters to six police forces urging \"a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's government work to Epstein\", the paper says.The Sunday Times says \"Metropolitan police officers were instructed to provide security for a celebrity dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein's New York home\", citing newly-released emails. According to the paper, the 2010 dinner party was held in Manhattan to honour Andrew, where \"two royal protection officers from Scotland Yard\" were stationed outside. \"Parliament should decide if Andy & Mandy have committed treason\", reads the Sun on Sunday's headline, leading with Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat's calls for an investigation into Andrew and former ambassador Peter Mandelson. The paper quotes Tugendhat's calls for a \"special committee\" to probe both men's \"links to Jeffrey Epstein\", which \"would have the power to summon witnesses and demand documents\". The Mail on Sunday reports \"King Charles was warned as long ago as 2019 that the Royal Family was being 'abused' by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's business associations\", quoting a whistleblower's emails to Buckingham Palace seen by the paper. It reports the emails tipped off the palace that \"the former Duke had secret financial links to controversial millionaire financier David Rowland\", as the emails \"threaten to draw Charles further into the crisis\". The BBC cannot verify the claims made by the Mail on Sunday and the former prince has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Melvyn Downes, the SAS Who Dares Wins star, leads the Daily Star on Sunday's front page with his criticism of Andrew, calling him \"arrogant and ignorant\". The paper reports that the TV star and author met the then-prince while serving as a soldier in the Staffordshire Regiment. The Independent leads with a \"harrowing dispatch\" from one of its journalists who  travelled to Nikopol, southern Ukraine, marking the four-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. \"The only place to hide from Putin's killer drones is our underground school\", reads the headline, featuring a photograph of teachers and students \"using a cellar as a makeshift classroom\".And finally, the Sunday Express leads with Dame Priti Patel's \"mission to save Chagos\". The shadow foreign secretary \"flies into Washington today on a mission to stop the Chagos Islands surrender,\" the paper writes, adding that if she succeeds in brokering a U-turn on the current deal, which Donald Trump opposes, it could cause \"fresh humiliation\" for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoJessica RawnsleyWatch: Giant tortoises return to Galápagos island after nearly 200 yearsGiant tortoises are roaming the Galápagos island of Floreana for the first time in more than 180 years, in what conservationists have called a \"hugely significant milestone\".The release of 158 captive-bred juvenile tortoises onto the island is part of the Floreana Ecological Restoration Project led by the Galápagos National Park Directorate.The reintroduction follows a \"back-breeding\" programme launched in 2017 after scientists discovered tortoises carrying ancestry of the Floreana giant tortoise on nearby Isabela island.Floreana's native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction in the 1840s by sailors who took thousands from the island for sustenance during long voyages. \"The restoration of Floreana has reached a hugely significant milestone, with 158 captive-bred giant tortoises released into the wild this week,\" the Galápagos Conservation Trust (GCT) said in a statement on Friday.\"This long-anticipated moment gives hope, not just for the future of Floreana, but for the future restoration of islands around the world,\" it added.Dr Jen Jones, GCT chief executive, described the moment as \"truly spine-tingling,\"  adding that it had validated two decades of collaboration between scientists, charities and the local community.The conservation project became possible after scientists discovered tortoises carrying Floreana ancestry on Wolf Volcano on Isabela island in 2008. Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

    "body": "4 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykEPA/ ShutterstockNasa has said that its 6 March launch day for its long-awaited lunar mission is now \"out of consideration\", after it spotted several last minute issues during routine checks that would prevent lift off. On Friday, the space agency said that its Artemis II mission, which would see astronauts sent to the moon for the first time in 50 years, would likely have the green light to launch within a matter of weeks. But NASA administrator Jared Isaacman announced on Saturday that setbacks would mean that further maintenance would have to be carried out. Four astronauts are preparing to be sent on the 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, marking humanity's furthest ever journey into space. Isaacman said he understood \"that people are disappointed by this development\", after almost 50-hours of checks on Thursday revealed no faults. The agency felt almost certain that its \"wet rehearsal\" had been a success, leading the team to announce that the launch could take place as soon as 6 March. But overnight on Friday, engineers observed an interruption in the flow of helium required for launch operations.Disruption to helium, which is used to pressurise fuel tanks and cool rocket systems, is treated as a serious technical issue, according to Nasa. Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the MoonThe test was the scientists' second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, having fixed earlier issues with filters and seals that had led to hydrogen leaks. The rocket was fuelled with around 730,000 ​gallons of propellant over several hours on Thursday, with the team stating that the simulation felt like \"a big step in us earning our right to fly\". But space missions are often fraught with setbacks, Isaaman said, highlighting that Neil Armstrong's 1966 Gemini 8 mission ended prematurely due to a technical issue, before his historic moon landing three years later. Three US astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hanse, are due to take off in the mega Moon rocket, which will allow them several hours to study the moon's surface up close. It is hoped that the mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but accepted this could be an ambitious time frame. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it had targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least eight of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes were among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Despite the deal, which followed 13 months of conflict, Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon, on targets it says are linked to the group, which is supported by Iran.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck what it described as Hezbollah command centres and that the group \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".In a separate statement on Saturday, the military said it had \"eliminated several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres... recently identified as operating to accelerate the organisation's readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks towards Israel\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government says Israel's ongoing actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

I enjoyed it.\"Residents were able to stroke and hold Pringle and WidgetThe medium-sized birds are based at Heythrop Zoological Gardens in Oxfordshire, a privately-owned zoo, which aims to educate on animal welfare. They visit care homes and hospices across the country.Luke Fillary, head bird keeper, was on hand at the home to provide instructions on how to interact with the birds to keep them and the residents safe.The 21-year-old handler said Pringle and Widget had been trained their entire lives to become therapy penguins.\"They both have been born at our zoo, so they have been in training their whole life,\" he said.\"Officially, they have been doing it for the past six years. Both are very well behaved.\"Jackie Kirkham visited her 91-year-old dad Derek when the penguins arrivedResidents of the care home also had the opportunity to invite their families along to meet the penguins.Jackie Kirkham, from Clifton in Nottingham, came to visit her 91-year-old dad Derek.She said: \"It's just something new for them, something that they probably won't be doing. He enjoys it and we do - it's comforting.\"The care home invites other therapy animals for residents to encounter.Bridget Peck, wellbeing coordinator at the home, said she had seen the benefit in bringing animals to the residents.\"I think animals play an important role for everybody's wellbeing,\" she said.\"Not just dogs - we have donkeys, ponies, every Easter we have the ducks and chickens come in.

    "body": "1 hour agoGrace DeanBBCPupils at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active\"If I had a pound for every time I said 'tuck your shirt in', I wouldn't need to teach, I'd be a millionaire,\" laments one Derbyshire secondary school teacher.The teacher, who asked us not to use their real name, works at a school with a strict uniform policy, where pupils can end up in detention if they repeatedly forget their tie or paint their nails. Pupils wear a blazer, shirt and tie, which \"look really uncomfortable\".\"We're meant to stand at the door and greet students just to check that they're wearing the uniform correctly and that their shirts are tucked in and they're looking smart and ready to learn,\" the teacher says. \"It just wastes time.\"She says the regular uniform checks are disruptive for pupils and give teachers unnecessary work.Another secondary school in Derbyshire, Alvaston Moor Academy, is now ditching blazers and ties in favour of a black all-weather jacket and polo shirt from September.The teacher we spoke to called the policy \"genius\". \"It looks so comfortable and it looks smart still,\" she says.One teacher called Alvaston Moor Academy's new uniform \"genius\"Currently, learning to tie a tie for secondary school is almost a rite of passage in the UK. In fact, a 2020 study of the uniform policies of every state secondary school in Scotland found that 90% required ties and 66% had blazers.But Alvaston Moor's new uniform appears to be part of a broader movement to introduce more practical school clothing. Proponents say this encourages children to be more active, is more comfortable and makes life easier for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) - but others argue traditional uniforms look smarter and instil discipline.One concern some parents and staff have about traditional school clothing is that blazers, which some schools demand pupils wear at all times, aren't always weather appropriate.'It's a bigger issue than people realise'One Leeds grandmother says her 11-year-old granddaughter is often \"freezing\" at school wearing her blazer, as opposed to a jumper: \"That isn't conducive to children's learning.\"A former teacher in Walsall says the secondary school where she used to work had the opposite problem - pupils usually weren't allowed to take their blazers off, leaving them uncomfortable at times. Mum Laura has a similar issue with her son, who has ADHD and often gets hot and claustrophobic in his formal shirt and tie.Laura's son isn't alone. Traditional school uniforms can often be difficult for SEND pupils.\"It's actually a bigger issue than people realise,\" says Duncan, from Devon, whose teenage daughter is autistic and has sensory processing disorder, which means she is more sensitive to how clothing feels against her skin.His daughter switched schools two years ago, and one of the main reasons was her school's inflexible uniform policy, he says.The teenager found some aspects of her uniform so uncomfortable that they became painful, like the embroidered logo, seams and tag on her polo shirt, her dad says.\"She was refusing school for a long time,\" Duncan says. He says her previous SEND school turned down his proposal that she wear her own T-shirt in the school's colour and black leggings or jogging bottoms.Among primary schools, the push for more practical school uniforms is largely to encourage physical activity and play. More than half of children aged five to 16 weren't meeting the chief medical officer's guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity per day in the 2023-2024 school year, says Sport England.Link to behaviour \"If you were taking your kids out on a Saturday to play, there is no way that you would choose the kind of clothes that we send children to school in,\" says Prof Helen Dodd, who researches children's play at the University of Exeter. \"The clothes that they're wearing are getting in the way.\"A small-scale 2012 study by Australian academics suggested that girls at primary schools were \"significantly more active\" during breaks and at lunchtime when they wore their sports uniform rather than their winter uniform. A 2021 study was less conclusive but suggested that wearing sports uniforms \"may yield small improvements\" in activity levels throughout the day.Academics and parents also push back against some of the main arguments in favour of more traditional uniforms - for example, that they encourage better behaviour and prepare pupils for the world of work.\"The research evidence does not support that smart uniform affects behaviour,\" says Dodd from the University of Exeter.And fewer people are wearing blazers and ties to work after the pandemic led to people dressing more informally for the office. What people wear to the office has \"just gone so casual\" in the past few years, personal stylist Karina Taylor previously told BBC News, attributing this to the rise in remote work.But many people told BBC News they were still in favour of having some kind of uniform to create a sense of community and to stop pupils who couldn't afford the latest trends feeling left out.\"I think you can have a school uniform without it being cumbersome,\" says Duncan, who also has a son who wears a blazer and tie to middle school.'You don't have to wear a uniform to learn'Some schools have already ditched blazers and ties in favour of a more comfortable uniform.A survey of teachers in 2024 by the app Teacher Tapp suggested that fewer secondary school pupils were wearing ties than the previous year.The pandemic affected school uniform policies, as many pupils could wear what they wanted for virtual lessons, says Dr Rachel Shanks of the University of Aberdeen.\"People could see, especially teenagers, you don't have to be wearing a uniform to be learning,\" she says.And after lockdown, some primary schools began letting pupils come in in their sports kits on days they had PE, \"and a lot of schools have kept to that\" after realising pupils were more comfortable, she says.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to what it called an \"always active\" uniform in 2024 with support from Youth Sport Trust. Pupils now wear leggings or jogging bottoms, a t-shirt and a hoodie, with black trainers.Head teacher Iain Williamson tells BBC News it was \"one of the best changes\" the school had introduced, with attendance and behaviour improving afterwards.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to an \"always active\" uniform in 2024He reels off the benefits: PE lessons are 20 minutes longer now since pupils don't need to get changed, they don't have to worry about bringing their sports kit, the uniform is quick drying and doesn't need ironing, and pupils are more active in the playground.Many staff members at the school even opt to wear the active uniforms, too, he says.Some schools say less formal uniforms particularly benefit girls.Girls at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active, head teacher Catherine Parker tells BBC News. Since introducing the new uniform, girls play more during break time, she says.Rachel's daughter is in year seven at a secondary school in Cheshire where pupils wear polo shirts with a choice of sweatshirt, jumper or fleece.\"It's really practical, it looks really smart,\" Rachel says.Duncan's daughter's new SEND school doesn't have a uniform.\"She's allowed to wear what she wants and she's comfortable in because there is an understanding there that it makes a big difference to her ability to engage,\" she says.",

    "body": "Iran students stage first large anti-government protests since deadly crackdown3 hours agoSiavash Mehdi-Ardalan,BBC PersianandJaroslav LukivScuffles break out at Sharif University in TehranStudents at several universities in Iran have staged anti-government protests - the first such rallies on this scale since last month's deadly crackdown by the authorities.The BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. Scuffles were later seen breaking out between them and government supporters. A sit-in was held at another Tehran university, and a rally reported in the north-east. Students were honouring thousands of those killed in mass protests in January.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.US and Iranian officials met in Switzerland on Tuesday and said progress had been made in talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme.But despite the reported progress, Trump said afterwards that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached with Iran or the US would take military action. The US leader has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\". Footage verified by the BBC shows hundreds of protesters - many with national Iranian flags - peacefully marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology at the start of a new semester on Saturday.The crowds chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and other anti-government slogans.Supporters of a rival pro-government rally are seen nearby in the video. Scuffles are later seen breaking out between the two camps.Verified photos have also emerged showing a peaceful sit-in protest at the capital's Shahid Beheshti University.The BBC have also verified footage from another Tehran university, Amir Kabir University of Technology, showing chanting against the government.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city in the north-east, local students reportedly chanted: \"Freedom, freedom\" and \"Students, shout, shout for your rights\".Sizeable demonstrations in other locations were also reported later in the day, with calls for further rallies on Sunday.It is not immediately clear whether any demonstrators have been arrested.Last month's protests began over economic grievances and soon spread to become the largest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people during that wave, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. Hrana also said it was investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Saturday's protests come as the Iranian authorities are preparing for a possible war with the US.The exiled opposition is adamantly calling on President Trump to make good on his threats and strike, hoping for a quick downfall of the current hardline government. But other opposition groups are opposed to outside intervention.The opposing sides have been involved in disinformation campaigns of social media, trying to maximise their conflicting narratives of what Iranian people want.Additional reporting by BBC Persian's Ghoncheh Habibiazad, and BBC Verify's Richard Irvine-Brown and Shayan Sardarizadeh.",

    "body": "10 hours agoBBCKenny MacAskill became the Alba Party leader in March 2025The pro-independence Alba Party is unlikely to contest the Holyrood election in May due to its \"perilous financial position\", its leader has confirmed.In an email seen by BBC Scotland News, Kenny MacAskill said the party faced an \"immediate crisis\" and it was unlikely it would be able to register for the Scottish Parliament election.The former SNP justice secretary added: \"That brings also into question the viability of a party which neither has financial resource nor the ability to contest elections.\"MacAskill said he would provide an update on the party's situation in the coming days.Getty ImagesFormer SNP leader Alex Salmond launched the Alba Party ahead of the 2021 Holyrood electionThe ex-first minister said the aim was to build \"a supermajority for independence\" at Holyrood after the election that May.But Alba failed to win any seats and only polled 1.7% of the regional vote.The sudden death of Salmond in October 2024 triggered a leadership contest in which MacAskill defeated former SNP leadership contender Ash Regan.PA MediaChris McEleny previously said he had stepped down from the role It followed a row between the party and its former general secretary, Chris McEleny, who was dismissed early last year after initially being suspended for alleged gross misconduct.In an email to party members on Saturday, MacAskill said that he expected \"matters to progress further shortly\".He added: \"I can assure you of integrity of current staff and elected office bearers but neither that nor justice being done addresses the perilous financial position which we find ourselves in as a result.\"A source close to McEleny previously said he was pursuing a case for unfair dismissal by the party through an employment tribunal.At the time, the source said he was \"bitterly disappointed about any suggestion that Alex Salmond was complicit in not being fully aware of how his political party was being run.\"Is this the end for the Alba Party, just five years after it all began?That is the clear signal from the current party leader Kenny MacAskill who is questioning its \"viability\".But some party members seem determined to keep the pro-independence party going.That includes Alex Salmond's niece Christina Hendry and the former SNP MP Angus McNeill, who insists Alba candidates will stand in the 2026 election despite what he calls \"temporary blips\".Alba has been riven with internal conflict since the death of its founder Alex Salmond and the election contest to replace him as leader.It now appears that senior figures cannot even agree whether or not Alba has a future worth fighting for.In his email, MacAskill explained that the Electoral Commission had been flexible with the party's late lodging of audited accounts.\"But we face a financial situation where we simply cannot provide the further accounts which they require, along with meeting staff wages and covering other costs which we are either tied into or are required to meet,\" he added.\"In these circumstances fighting an election is simply beyond our resources.\"He said the party was required to formally re-register by the end of next month, but this looked unlikely.\"I know this will come as a bitter blow to you,\" MacAskill added.Last week millionaire businessman and rock drummer Paul McManus confirmed he would fund the action after Moira agreed to transfer the legal rights of the case.Alba candidate Christina Hendry, a niece of Salmond, said she was \"frustrated\" by the announcement.She added: \"The decision to de-register the party should not rest with a handful of members in the leadership team, some of whom have no electoral mandate. It belongs to you, the entire Alba Party membership.\"I am not prepared to stand by and watch my uncle's legacy discarded and the cause of independence abandoned.\"This party belongs to the members, and it is up to the members to take it forward.\"",

Teams were tasked with illustrating the theme of fair play and Unwin said the sculpture she designed was \"ridiculously complicated\".She said: \"It was so difficult to work it out but we did actually do it.\"At about four o'clock on the last day, I was sort of thinking: 'I don't know if it's going to work,' but it did. \"It was a bit rough around the edges, but it was snowing quite a bit, so it covered up the mistakes.\"She added: \"We came second which is just very exciting because there were some really good ones.\"Living in Devon she is unable to practice with snow but, as a stone sculptor by trade, she said carving both was a similar practice. \"Stone is obviously harder and, generally, I'm working much smaller, but it's taking stuff off to create the sculpture, so it's very much the same technique.\"More on this storyRelated internet links ",

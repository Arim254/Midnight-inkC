    "body": "14 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorHurtling into view, noisily and quickly, comes another twist in the rollercoaster that is diplomacy in the era of President Trump.Splenetic social media posts, bold claims in front of the cameras and provocative and to some deeply offensive AI-generated images of an American-owned Greenland.And now, so many of America's allies allow themselves a deep breath and an expression of relief.Just as so many of the furious rows begin on social media under this US president, this latest one has cooled considerably via social media too - with another post on his platform Truth Social.Within the government here in the UK, there is a quiet pride that Britain made its contribution to the welter of diplomacy European neighbours and others have been doing in recent days.I hear that the British diplomatic machine cranked up at every level: involving ministers, officials and embassies.The prime minister insisted on what he saw as the merits of \"calm discussion\" - but had to judge how to calibrate his response, both publicly and privately.At the core of this row, there was a fundamental public disagreement between Downing Street and the White House, something Sir Keir Starmer has sought to avoid where possible.But for him the integrity of a state - with Greenland's future being for Greenlanders and Denmark to decide - was a non-negotiable bottom line.In the 48 hours or so since spelling that out explicitly, in front of the cameras, on Monday morning, risk hung in the air - could the carefully cultivated relationship with President Trump be uprooted before our eyes?By Tuesday morning, it looked like the answer could be yes, with the president sounding off in capital letters about the government's deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, an arrangement he had previously endorsed.What might come next? Again Downing Street held its breath, before deciding to notch up its critique in the Commons on Wednesday.The prime minister told MPs he would \"not yield\" over his support for Greenland, despite the threat of tariffs. His team knew this wasn't without risk.Now, almost as quickly as the row accelerated, President Trump has hit the brakes.A deal has been done, the threat of tariffs and reality of tub thumping language has gone.And yes, we have heard this album before.The president makes a provocative and to many outrageous suggestion, reaction around the world scatters in multiple directions, the White House has seized the agenda.The world, or at least the West, splutters, frets, contorts and argues – and a solution is arrived at, but not before so many are brutally reminded of America's brute force, when led by a man happy to be brutish in his approach.And America's friends and foes, catching their breath, ponder what will prompt the next diplomatic grenade from the Oval Office.",

    "body": "Japan has suspended operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant, hours after its restart, its operator has said.An alarm sounded \"during reactor-start-up procedures\" at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Tokyo but the reactor remained \"stable\", Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi said.Reactor number six restarted on Wednesday a day later than planned due to an alarm malfunction - the first at the plant to be turned on since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a meltdown at its Fukushima plant 15 years ago, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.At the time, radiation leakage from the plant forced more than 150,000 people to evacuate their homes. Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe.Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was \"stable and there is no radioactive impact outside\".The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month.Kobayashi said Tepco was \"currently investigating the cause\" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned.This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational.Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents.A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December.Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030.After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.",

    "body": "12 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC NewsBBCNicky spent 10 years as a hostage negotiator for the Metropolitan PoliceBeing a parent and working as a hostage negotiator don't immediately appear to have a lot in common, but someone who has been both says tricks she learnt in her profession can help you at home.Nicky Perfect spent over 30 years as a Metropolitan Police officer, including 10 years as an international hostage and crisis negotiator, in the elite New Scotland Yard Hostage and Crisis Negotiation Unit.At times, she says, knowing what to do or say as a parent, can feel high-stakes - the difference between keeping the peace and a full-on meltdown or argument.Here are the three techniques from her high-pressure career which will help you stay calm and in control as a parent, she told the BBC's Parenting Download podcast, 1. Give them a 'no choice choice'Getty ImagesKids regularly push boundaries and often want to do the opposite of what you ask them.In situations like these rather than asserting your authority and using the \"because I said so\" phrase, try the \"no choice choice\", trick, says Nicky.This means reframing the situation by continuing to enforce one choice, but doing so in a manner that still gives your child a sense of control and influence. So, asking a child whether they want to put their coat on in the house or when they go outside, for example, can help them feel heard, respected and involved - all while leading to the same outcome.Another example could be giving a child that is refusing to eat vegetables the option between broccoli or sprouts.This may not work every time, but it can help limit immediate resistance.2. Wait 90 seconds before respondingGetty ImagesWhen dealing with sensitive topics, Nicky advises not responding for 90 seconds to  stop you responding emotionally.As an FBI agent once told her: \"your job in life is not to change people… you can't… the only thing you can choose is how to respond.\"It is important to remember this choice exists even when emotions threaten to overwhelm the logical side of our brain.\"The response might just be, 'do you know what? I'm being quite emotional now. I need to go away and think about this',\" says Nicky. \"Or it might be you just don't say anything, and you listen to what they've got to say.\"As a co-parent, she had to put this into practice herself when her stepdaughter admitted she wanted to spend Christmas Day with her dad and siblings after they moved further away.Internally, Nicky desperately wanted her to stay. But, she says, \"somewhere along the line you have to press the pause button... and say this is your Christmas. It's a day in my life. What do you want?\"Accepting this made it easier for her to decide how to spend the day herself - as well as plan a new way of celebrating together with her stepdaughter, either before or after.3. See their perspective Getty ImagesSeeing the world from the other person's point of view, be they big or small, is key, says Nicky.This way you can sell the benefits of your outcome to the other person, while also making them feel heard.\"It's called the 'power of' negotiation, because if you give people reasons why something should or shouldn't happen, they're more likely to accept it,\" says Nicky.\"It's about recognising it and being really honest with people. People are far more receptive to your honesty than you think they're going to be,\" she says.Take the common problem of tantrums over bedtime. Children can often struggle with the loss of autonomy that a sudden bedtime announcement brings.A solution, says Nicky, is to consider how the child feels in that moment, rather than view it as an adult.  If they're enjoying playing and then you suddenly say it's time to go to bed, this can feel abrupt and naturally upset them.Instead, her suggestion is to prepare the child as soon as they get home - weaving the night time routine naturally into the conversation and reinforcing it regularly throughout the evening. Something like \"we'll have dinner, then watch some TV and then it's bedtime\" acts as a good framework.The child then feels more involved and aware of what is coming, even if they don't necessarily like it - meaning hopefully fewer tantrums.",

His departure from the House of Commons would trigger a by-election in his Gorton and Denton constituency, which Labour won at the last election with a majority of 13,000. Gwynne has been contacted for coment.One senior source told the BBC that Gwynne had reached agreement on a pension on Thursday – which would allow him to retire as an MP on medical grounds – but cautioned that while they believed Gwynne's departure was highly likely, it was not certain that an announcement would come today.There has been speculation Burnham would like to replace Sir Keir as party leader, however he would only be able to enter any leadership race as a Labour MP. Although a seat could become available in Greater Manchester, Burnham would need approval to run from Labour's national executive committee a body which is mostly controlled by allies of Starmer.If selected as Labour's candidate, he would still have to win a by-election in Gorton and Denton at a time when the party's popularity is low - although recent polling suggests Labour could hold on to the seat.In the 2024 general election, Gwynne won with 18,000 votes. The Reform UK candidate came second securing 5,000 votes, just ahead of the Greens who picked up 4,810 votes.Burnham has previously not denied he could challenge Sir Keir, saying: \"I'm not going to rule out what might or might not happen in the future.\"Asked about Gwynne's potential resignation, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"I'm aware he's had some very serious health challenges. And you know, for all of the other challenges he's gone through and some of the difficulties he's had, I wish him and his family well.\"Whether or not Andy will throw his hat into the ring, is for Andy to consider, and ultimately for party members to decide but we need strong candidates.\"\"Whether it's in government nationally, or whether it's leading the city and the region locally, he makes a massive impact and makes a really big difference.\"Gwynne was sacked as a health minister and suspended from Labour last year after the Mail on Sunday published some of his private messages, including one disparaging an elderly constituent. Gwynne apologised for offence cause and said he regretted \"badly misjudged\" comments in the WhatsApp group named Trigger Me Timbers. The parliamentary commissioner for standards launched an investigation, which 11 months on has yet to be concluded. ",

    "body": "17 hours agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentReutersA makeshift memorial was created after the 14 December attack at Bondi Beach From the outside, the vacant shop on the corner of a busy avenue in central Sydney looks abandoned. Plastic sheeting is taped across all the windows and there's a large padlock hanging on the door handle.Step inside, though, and you're greeted by cuddly toys, candles, trinkets and messages of hope scribbled on large sheets.All of them come from a makeshift memorial that was created after the 14 December attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people.So when the Sydney Jewish Museum and the Australian Jewish Historical Society heard that the memorial would be removed by the local council, they sprang into action to ensure everything contained within it could live on.BBC/Katy WatsonA pair of shoes from Matilda Bee - the youngest victim of the attack - are among the items which will be used in a permanent memorialMany of the items now live in neat squares made out of masking tape on the shop floor. One says \"bees\" - within it are dozens of knitted and cuddly insects - a nod to 10-year-old Matilda Bee, the youngest victim of the attack. Another has a heap of deflated foil balloons – again, mostly bees. There's also a box of stones – Jewish mourners traditionally place a stone on a grave instead of flowers – as well as flags, books, Christmas decorations and even a Barbie cracker. Some families who were unable to go to any of the vigils in Bondi have also paid a visit to the spaces housing the tributes.\"It was too overwhelming to be in Bondi, but in this space it was very quiet. And I think to see everything laid out and the amount, they found it really moving and meaningful,\" said Shannon Biederman, the senior curator at the Sydney Jewish Museum.Families also came to the flower space and were given flower pressing to do, while artists and community members joined in too.For Shannon, memorialising the items is a deeply personal task.Her family were regular attendees of Chanukah by the Sea - the festival targeted by the alleged gunmen. They had bought tickets to go but at the last minute, they changed their mind.They also knew the family of Rabbi Eli Schlanger, one of the 15 victims.\"I do work in a Holocaust museum, so the murder of Jews isn't something that I'm not used to, and I've learned to compartmentalise,\" she says. \"But it's different because I'm used to working with history and this is now, and we are a museum of memory, but we're still very much live in [this].BBC/Katy WatsonShannon Biederman and her family were regular attendees of Chanukah by the SeaAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the first to lay a bouquet in front of the Bondi Pavilion the morning after the attack. Over the course of a week, the tributes spread like a wave across the forecourt.The massacre at Bondi was Australia's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades and left the country reeling. It also saw people pointing the blame at the government for letting something like this happen to a community that had been repeatedly warning authorities about a rise in antisemitism in recent years.But the conversation is now trying to focus on bringing people together - a sentiment the community wants to see continued in a permanent memorial to the dead.On Thursday, landmarks across the country will also be lit up and a minute's silence held in honour of the victims. Australians are also being asked to perform a mitzvah – an everyday act of kindness such as checking in on a neighbour or a donation - a Jewish tradition and a way to bring people together after last month's attack.How the memorial will live on is still unclear – several artists have come forward, keen to work with some of the material but a committee will make the final decisions.'I started with a lot of anger' And while the toys and trinkets were catalogued - there was the greater challenge of dealing with the  flowers that had been left behind. Volunteers helped to preserve the three tonnes of bouquets and wreaths that were loaded into black bags and taken to a separate warehouse in North Sydney.The process was confronting, says Nina Sanadze, a Jewish artist from Melbourne, whose idea it was to save all the flowers and oversaw the operation.\"When they brought them here, they looked like 100 bodies,\" Nina says. \"It was shocking again.\"Once at the warehouse, dozens of volunteers began the slow process of hanging them up on metal fences that had also been sourced in haste.They also had to wear masks to protect themselves from the large amount of pollen circulating. Instagram/@picciesforpotatoWorkers wrapping up floral tributes in massive black sheets of plasticShannon also feared that the sheer quantity of flowers and the gases they were emitting could create a compost fire, so volunteers had to monitor temperatures carefully and brought in fans.\"The smell and the moisture here in the warehouse was overwhelming,\" says Nina. \"It was like being inside a perfume shop.\"Meanwhile the flowers kept on coming.\"After the council made decision to clean up this big collection of flowers, people continued to bring them,\" explains Nina. \"We had volunteers to go at night and collect them otherwise they'd get thrown away.\"BBC/Katy WatsonCardboard boxes full of flower bouquets sit in the warehouse waiting to be sortedThe stalks have been saved for compost – which Nina says she's considering turned into some kind of furniture.Some of the rose buds had also started to rot, but she's dried them out and made a resin artwork scattered with the salvageable petals.\"There's a lot of decay and sadness as well as beauty,\" she says of her improvised creation. \"[It] takes it straight into the storytelling of what happened - it's not a thing of perfect beauty but it's a story, it's a heartbreak and love all together.\"Though a heavy task, for many of the volunteers, helping preserve the mountain of tributes left at the site is a form of therapy. And while the concept for the memorial is still germinating, Nina has already pinned down the title.\"Petal by Petal,\" she says confidently. It speaks to the way volunteers have had to methodically go about preserving the material, and symbolises her own slow processing of the attack.\"I started with a lot of anger coming here,\" Nina admits. \"I feel like I'm leaving in better spirits.\"She hopes the resulting artworks and memorials can help the community do the same.\"It can soften hearts, it can communicate,\" she says. \"And one of the things with flowers is not only they speak of the fragility of humans, but also they have no language, everybody understands flowers.\"BBC/Katy WatsonNina Sanadze and a team of volunteers are memorialising the flowers ",

    "body": "Met Office weather warnings - including a more severe amber warning - have been issued for rain in parts of the UK.Heavy rain in eastern Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of England and Wales will bring significant rainfall totals and the risk of flooding.Strong winds will accompany the rain, particularly in north-east Scotland.Into Friday, Storm Ingrid - named by the Portuguese weather service - will bring rain and strong winds into south-western areas of England and Wales with further warnings issued here.Heavy rain and strong winds have continued in eastern Scotland, where there is a Met Office amber warning in force for Grampian, Angus, and Perth and Kinross until 18:00 GMT.Rainfall accumulations of 60-80mm are likely, with as much as 100-120mm over high ground. Totals since Wednesday evening may exceed 150 mm in a few places. This is expected to lead to some surface water and river flooding across the area.There is also a wider yellow warning across the rest of eastern Scotland where rainfall accumulations of 30-60mm will be seen widely.The Met Office warns that with the ground already saturated from recent rain and and snow thaw, this may lead to some flooding in places.A strong south-easterly wind in north-east Scotland will also make it feel particularly unpleasant.Additional yellow warnings are in force on Thursday across south-east Wales, Somerset and Devon from 08:00 to 16:00 and Northern Ireland from 10:00 to 23:59.Persistent and heavy rain in these areas through the day falling on saturated ground could lead to some flooding and transport disruption.On Thursday morning there were nearly 160 flood warnings in force across England, Scotland and Wales.Weather warningsFlood warningsElsewhere, the weather remains generally cloudy and breezy, with rain and drizzle.On Friday, the UK will be impacted by Storm Ingrid, which was named by the Portuguese weather service due to the impacts expected there from strong winds and heavy rain.The centre of Ingrid will move close to the south-west of England and north-west France. Winds in the UK will strengthen on Friday, with gusts up to 60mph expected in south-west England and Wales along with further heavy rain at times.A Met Office yellow warning will come into force here from 02:00 GMT Friday to 09:00 Saturday.While the winds won't be as powerful or dangerous as the near 100mph winds experienced in south-west England during Storm Goretti, there could still be some impacts.With saturated ground, flooding is possible and, with coastal gales, there will be large overtopping waves.It will likely stay windy through Saturday morning as the centre of Ingrid stalls to the south-west. Winds will gradually ease as the day progresses.The rest of the UK will avoid any impacts associated with Storm Ingrid, but the rain in eastern Scotland will continue, with some snow over higher ground.While Storm Ingrid will affect south-western parts of England, for the rest of the UK, we will start to see a brisk south-east to easterly wind.Drawing in colder air from north-east Europe, temperatures will start to drop over the weekend and next week with a cold snap.By Monday, temperatures will fall to 4 to 6C below the average for the end of January.The easterly wind will also likely bring occasional wintry showers, with snow for some parts of the UK.Where exactly, and how much snow, is not yet certain, but wintry hazards are likely.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondentReutersEgisto Ott is accused of collecting large amounts of data and handing information to Russian intelligenceFormer intelligence official Egisto Ott has gone on trial in Vienna on Thursday, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years.Egisto Ott, 63, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard.Ott denies the charges.Jan Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020.The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service.The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Marsalek.Prosecutors in Vienna say Egisto Ott \"abused his authority\" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements.They say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases.Prosecutors also charge him with supporting \"a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria\" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021.They say Egisto Ott gave this information to Jan Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return.In 2022, prosecutors say, Jan Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service.He is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia.Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow.Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty.When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as \"a threat to democracy and our country's national security\".Munich PoliceJan Marsalek, former executive at Wirecard, is believed to have escaped to MoscowIn a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn was missing from its accounts.Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020.Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as \"an extension of Russia's arm\" in Austria.The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them.Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume.He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia.Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive.\"I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts,\" he wrote to one of the Bulgarians, Roussev, on Telegram in February 2022.In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian.\"Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them,\" the Austrian responded.\"In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond.\"",

    "body": "23 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosandTom Symonds & Helena Wilkinson,Royal Courts of JusticeElizabeth Hurley has said in a witness statement to court that she felt \"crushed\" over \"brutal invasion of privacy\" by the publisher of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.She alleges the Mail tapped her landlines and placed \"surreptitious mics on my home windows\" in an effort to get stories.The actress became tearful as she gave evidence in her case against publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) at London's Royal Courts of Justice on Thursday.She is one of seven high-profile claimants accusing ANL of \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period. The publisher has denied wrongdoing.Hurley's claim against the publisher relates to 15 articles through which she says ANL \"wilfully exploited my stolen information using its arsenal of illegal means\".She says five of the articles are about her son Damian and his father.Hurley also claims the Mail stole her medical information while she was pregnant with Damian, who she refers to as the \"centre of my world\".When asked in the witness box why she had not previously taken legal action against the publisher, she said it was because from what she remembered, \"complaints were for libel\" and the articles were \"in essence true\".\"I believe that is because people were listening to me speak,\" she told the court.It was put to her by Antony White KC for ANL that there had been \"leaks in your camp\" which had led to stories and she agreed she had initially thought that.But she insisted that none of her close friends would have talked to the press without her permission.Challenged about a 2001 story in Hello Magazine, the barrister pointed out that two friends had been quoted talking about her.\"They would never ever say anything indiscreet about me,\" she replied.Another claimant, the Duke of Sussex, was seen entering the court after a spokesperson said he would be present \"to support, and show solidarity\".Giving evidence on Wednesday, Prince Harry was visibly emotional as he said the publisher made the life of his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, \"an absolute misery\". The prince's voice broke as he said the court battle had been a \"horrible experience\" for his family and that all he wanted was \"an apology and some accountability\".Joining Hurley and Prince Harry in bringing the lawsuit against ANL are:Fellow actress Sadie FrostSir Elton John and his husband David FurnishSir Simon Hughes, the former Liberal Democrat MPBaroness Doreen Lawrence, a campaigner whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993The claimants have accused ANL of \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for stories between 1993 and \"beyond\" 2018, including through private investigators and blagging.ANL has previously denied allegations of unlawful information gathering.White, representing the publisher, has said the claimants are \"clutching at straws\" and that the claims had been brought too late. Privacy cases must usually be brought within six years of the alleged breach, unless victims can show they could not bring a case at the time.White argued the reporters behind the stories had provided a \"compelling account of a pattern of legitimate sourcing of articles\", saying that in some cases celebrities' friends and social circles contributed as sources to Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday journalists.In court on Wednesday, he suggested Harry knew his social circle was \"leaky\", to which the prince responded: \"My social circles were not leaky, I want to make that absolutely clear.\"The case continues and is expected to last nine weeks. This is a civil trial, so there is no jury and the judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, will decide the case on his own.It is Prince Harry's third major court battle accusing newspaper groups of unlawful behaviour.In December 2023, he won 15 claims in his case accusing Mirror Group Newspapers of unlawfully gathering information for stories published about him.In January 2025, the publisher of the Sun newspaper agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and issued an apology to the prince over claims of unlawful intrusion into his life.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJoshua AskewSouth EastPA MediaThe government said the Crowborough move was part of \"its mission to end the use of expensive hotels\"The first asylum seekers have been moved into a former military site in East Sussex, the Home Office has confirmed. Twenty-seven men seeking asylum have arrived at the Crowborough training camp, which will eventually be scaled up to house more than 500 migrants.The government said the move was part of its \"mission to end the use of expensive hotels\", with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood saying \"Crowborough is just the start\".There have been frequent protests against the plans, which were first announced last year but had been put on hold.The government said moving to large sites like Crowborough was an important part of its \"reforms to tackle illegal migration and the pull factors that make the UK an attractive destination\".Mahmood said: \"I will bring forward site after site until every asylum hotel is closed and returned to local communities.\"More than 400 hotels were opened under the last government at a cost of £9m a day, according to the Home Office.Now just under 200 remain in use, with overall asylum costs down 15%, it added.Home Office via PA MediaThe Home Office released images on Thursday showing areas of the site, including dorm-style communal sleeping arrangementsWealden District Council leader James Partridge said housing asylum seekers at Crowborough was the wrong decision.But he added: \"We do need to make the best of it\".Partridge called on the community to come together \"in the way we did when the Afghan families and Ukrainian refugees arrived\".He said the local authority was looking to see if it could legally challenge the move. Home Office via PA MediaThe site also includes designated medical and interview areasThe announcement of the plans in October sparked mixed reactions from the community. Some were concerned about safety and the potential impact on local services, though others called for compassion. Crowborough Shield, which describes itself as a non-political, voluntary residents group, launched a legal case against the plans in December. A spokesperson for the group said: \"Despite our collective, lawful, peaceful and consistent efforts to get the home secretary to listen to our concerns, she has ignored them.\"Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp called it \"another day of shame for the Labour government\". He accused the Home Office of having \"kicked out\" army and RAF cadets who use the site for training every year. More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterUK government borrowing fell sharply last month, due to more income from taxes and higher National Insurance Contributions outweighing spending, figures show.In December government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - was £11.6bn, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.It is down £7.1bn - 38% - from the previous December, and lower than what many economists had predicted, but still higher than that borrowed in the same month in 2023.Tom Davies, Deputy Director for the ONS public service division, said the fall was a result of \"receipts being up strongly on last year whereas spending is only modestly higher\".Despite the annual fall, the December 2025 figure was the tenth highest for the month since records began in 1993, without adjusting for inflation.And it remains higher than December 2023, when borrowing stood at £8.1bn.The figures show the government received £7.7bn more – an 8.9% rise - in taxes in December 2025 than it did in the same month in 2024.This comprised increases in income tax, corporation tax, VAT and National Insurance contributions (NIC), the ONS said – with changes to the rate of NIC paid by employers coming into effect in April last year. The ongoing freeze to income tax thresholds means more people are being \"dragged\" into paying tax, or more tax, as their wages rise - a process known as fiscal drag.Public spending in December also increased - partly caused by an increase in inflation-linked benefits.It was provisionally estimated to be £92.9bn - £3.2bn (3.5%) more than in December 2024.But this rise was more than outweighed by the increase in money collected through taxes and NIC contributions.According to provisional estimates, borrowing over the financial year to December totalled £140.4bn, about £300m lower than the same period in 2024, the ONS said.The borrowing figure was estimated as 4.6% of GDP - 0.2 percentage points down from the same period last year. It was the third-highest level of borrowing over April-December on record, after those in 2020 and 2024. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, said the government was \"stabilising the economy, reducing borrowing, rooting out waste in the public sector\".He said: \"Last year we doubled our headroom and we are forecast to cut borrowing more than any other G7 country with borrowing set to be the lowest this year since before the pandemic.\"Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was the second year in a row Labour had  \"presided over record borrowing, outside the pandemic\".He said debt interest was \"at almost double what we spend on defence\", adding: \"Only the Conservatives have a credible plan to restore stability to the public finances.\"The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said public borrowing between April and December was £4.1bn (2.8%) below its current forecast.Its forecast for the last three months of the financial year assumes a 50% rise in capital gains tax (CGT) receipts in January compared to the same month in 2025, due to people disposing of assets to benefit from lower rates ahead of anticipated CGT tax rises in the November Budget. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said public finances were \"finally showing signs of improvement in recent months\".\"What's more, a further improvement in January is on the way,\" she said, adding a \"bumper set\" of self-assessment tax and CGT receipts was likely.But she said the \"big picture is that the pace of deficit reduction remains very slow\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondentGetty ImagesProtesters have taken to the streets outside the US consulate in Nuuk, Greenland this monthWhat on earth has the last fortnight been all about?In the wake of a successful military operation in Venezuela earlier this month, a buoyed-up Donald Trump started to ratchet up the rhetoric on Greenland.Day after day, the world was treated to claims of ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional allies in Europe.Now, in an apparent puff of smoke, it may all have gone.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, arguably the Trump whisperer-in-chief, seems to have talked the president down from his dangerously high hobby horse.Watch: Trump takes aim at world leaders in Davos speechThe ground may have been laid last week during a visit to Washington by the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. The visit concluded with agreement on a \"working group\" to discuss Greenland's future.But Rutte appears to have finessed an issue that had threatened to shatter the north Atlantic alliance.We don't yet know the details of the deal, but many will wonder why it needed a frenetic two-week crisis to get here.Denmark had long said that it was only too happy to see an increased American military presence on Greenland.If Nato has now pledged to up its presence on and around the island, then that will go some way towards reassuring Donald Trump that the alliance is finally paying proper attention to Greenland.The New York Times quotes anonymous officials as saying one idea under discussion is for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases - similar to the arrangement by which the UK maintains sovereign bases on Cyprus.Watch: How was Trump's Davos speech received?Trump said the deal would involve access to Greenland's mineral resources.Neither Denmark nor Nato has confirmed these or any other reports.Nato said discussions would \"focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts, especially the seven Arctic Allies\" (the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) and aimed to prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold, economic or military, in Greenland.It won't be long before details of the deal emerge. But the fact that Donald Trump triggered a fortnight of high drama and a sense of existential crisis within Nato to get here will not easily be forgotten.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a \"rupture\", saying the old order was \"not coming back.\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of \"seismic change\" and urged greater European independence.It's hard to see a quick return to business as usual.Ros Atkins on... Trump's Davos speech claims",

    "body": "12 hours agoAnnabel RackhamCulture reporterGetty ImagesKutcher is known for TV series That '70s Show and Punk'd, as well as films such as Dude, Where's My Car?US actor Ashton Kutcher has said he believes Hollywood is not pushing unreasonably high beauty standards, adding that wider society is to blame for the increasing desire to look perfect.The 47-year-old is currently starring in science fiction show The Beauty, which sees a drug become available that can transform a person into the most attractive version of themselves.Speaking to BBC News, Kutcher said he does not believe the film and TV industry is \"imparting the need for aesthetic homogeny\".\"Entertainment is a reflection of society,\" he said.Across the different characters and actors in shows, some are \"traditionally handsome\" but others are just \"really interesting\", he said.\"It doesn't make them not beautiful, it just makes them break a mould,\" he added.Instead, Kutcher says the real driver in perfectionism is the \"everyone being on camera all the time\".Disney via Getty ImagesBella Hadid makes a cameo in The Beauty as a supermodel with a big secretKutcher's character in the science-fiction series is a tech billionaire responsible for bringing a beautifying injection into the world, which he has taken himself in an effort to look much younger.He is then faced with the side effects of the drug, which include its ability to be sexually transmitted and cause those infected to burn from the inside.Kutcher has recently acknowledged the parallels between The Beauty and 2024's Oscar-nominated body horror film The Substance, which starred his ex-wife Demi Moore.He says Moore, who won a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild award for the role, \"killed it\".\"I'm so proud of her,\" he said.The Beauty, which was adapted from a comic book by American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy, is set in the modern day and includes storylines that address some of society's current biggest talking points.There is even a cameo from singer Meghan Trainor, who has spoken openly about her weight loss from the use of weight-loss drug Mounjaro, and appears on the show briefly playing a character obsessed with losing some pounds.Kutcher said a lot of the conversations he had with Murphy whilst filming the show \"centred on Mounjaro and Ozempic\".He recalled they spoke about \"people clamouring to get them and paying in order to get them and not necessarily because they had diabetes or hypertension\", and all the possible outcomes these drugs may have on society.Disney via Getty ImagesAshton Kutcher stars in the new Ryan Murphy show as a billionaire who has found the secret to eternal youthKutcher, who has been married to actress Mila Kunis since 2015, also said \"cosmetic enhancement is becoming socially accepted day by day\".The latest figures for cosmetic surgery in the UK show 27,462 cosmetic procedures were performed in 2024 - up 5% from 2023.More than 10,000 non-surgical procedures such as fillers and Botox were performed by members of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) in the same period.\"It used to be that if you got Botox, you would not tell anybody you got them but now people are like 'let's get a coffee and Botox,'\" Kutcher reflected.\"Beauty is tethered to security, success and power, right? We now have influencers that are millionaires - you can have influence, you can have power by using your phone and expressing what you like and don't like.\"His co-star Jeremy Pope, who is best known for starring in American drama Pose, said the show \"asks the audience how much would you give or sacrifice to experience ultimate beauty or success\".\"It's just a comment in where we are in the centre of our culture right now,\" he added.Disney via Getty ImagesEvan Peters and Rebecca Hall star as two FBI agents investigating mysterious deaths of models across the worldSeveral critics have drawn parallels between the events of the series and real life. \"The Beauty satirises our world of Instagram perfection, tweakments and weight-loss jabs, said the Telegraph's Anita Singh in a four-star review. \"It is a work of sci-fi, but only in the fine detail.\"Starring opposite Kutcher and Pope in the series is Rebecca Hall, who told the BBC the show draws comparisons to Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, a film adaptation of which she previously starred in.\"This show is bringing up the conversation that if you keep chasing some version of beauty that's outside of yourself, you may never be satisfied and you might end up going crazy,\" she said.Hall's character in the show is an FBI agent, tasked with uncovering why some of the most beautiful people around the world are dying gruesomely and randomly. Paired up with a younger male FBI agent, played by X-Men star Evan Peters, her character faces an internal battle over whether she is attractive enough.The 43-year-old said starring on the show has made her think about where society is heading.\"There's this notion that there is a standard we should all go out and buy,\" she said. \"It's madness because then we'll all end up looking exactly the same and then we will immediately pivot to finding something else beautiful.\"The actress concluded that \"what's weird\" about society right now is that \"if you have enough money you can make yourself look pretty much like anything you want\".",

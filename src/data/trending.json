    "body": "Brisbane is not a city to give England some much-needed Ashes optimism.After defeat by Australia in the first Test, the tourists must stir themselves for a trip to the Gabba, a ground where England have not won since 1986.Men wearing three lions have habitually been lambs to the slaughter at the Gabbatoir.Among a recent history of broken English hopes, dreams and bodies is a source of inspiration delivered by a shining knight.It is exactly 15 years since Sir Alastair Cook conquered the Gabba with a career-defining 235 not out, saving the first Test of 2010-11 and setting England on course to their only Ashes series win in Australia in the past 38 years.It was the beginning of Cook's triumphant circumnavigation of Australia; three hundreds and 766 runs. Wally Hammond is the only Englishman to score more runs in a series in this country.After that first Test draw at the Gabba, England won 3-1, with all victories by an innings They have not won a Test here since.\"You forget the tough times, the nervousness and anxiety that went into that,\" Cook tells the Test Match Special podcast.\"I look back with pride. I played a significant part in a series when England won 3-1 in Australia and all three games were won by an innings. That just doesn't happen. One day, I need to sit down and watch some of it.\"Cook's road to his Australian epic began 18 months earlier, at the end of the 2009 Ashes in the UK. England won, but the opener averaged less than 25 with just one score above 50.He wanted more.\"Cricket is a team game, but the individuality does make you feel like you want to pull your weight,\" he says. \"The stats are very clear. I wanted to be part of an Ashes series I did well in, then it would have meant more.\"I wanted to judge myself against the best and my game wasn't stacking up against the best bowlers in the world.\"Two days after the celebrations I was back hitting hundreds and hundreds of balls in the nets with Graham Gooch, trying to groove something very unnatural, thinking in the long run it would be better for my technique.\"The initial results were encouraging. Cook made three hundreds on the 2009-10 winter tours to South Africa and Bangladesh.When Cook returned to England for the 2010 summer, the left-hander had a \"stinker\". In eight innings against Bangladesh and Pakistan, his highest score was 29.On nought not out at the end of the second day of the third Test against Pakistan at The Oval, Cook was convinced he was playing his last Test innings before being dropped.\"I was sitting in the bar, trying to find the answer in the bottom of a beer bottle,\" he says.\"I made the promise to myself: 'Don't get out defending tomorrow'. That was where I was at.\"It was a clearing of the mind. I decided to go back to my old technique. I attacked and had 76 by lunch on the third day.\"Cook's 110 guaranteed his seat on the plane to Australia, albeit via an infamous team-bonding trip to Bavaria dreamt up by England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss.Players carried bricks uphill and did hundreds of press-ups. James Anderson suffered a cracked rib in a boxing session. Luckily for Cook, he missed almost all of it.\"I was at my brother's wedding,\" he says. \"I turned up for the last day. The most broken men were Strauss and Flower. I thought it served them right because they organised the thing.\"I'm genuinely disappointed I did miss it. For the next little while there were always references back to that camp. At the time it was horrendous, but the fact we were still talking about it years later shows it had its worth. I think people really opened up around the camp fire every night.\"Well-drilled on and off the pitch, England continued their preparations by winning two and drawing one of their warm-up games in Australia - Cook scored a century against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval.Come the first Test at the Gabba, they were hit by Peter Siddle's hat-trick, then hundreds from Mike Hussey and Brad Haddin.An hour before the end of the third day, Cook and Strauss opened England's second innings with a deficit of 221 runs. They reached 19-0 at stumps and followed up with a performance etched in Ashes folklore.\"I don't remember the messages, anything of what we spoke about,\" says Cook. \"We had an experienced team and the pitch had no demons. We just had to show some fight.\"The left-handers added 188 for the first wicket. Strauss made 110. When the captain fell, Jonathan Trott eased into Cook's slipstream for an unbeaten 135.Cook's 235 not out was the highest score by an Englishman in Australia for 82 years, beaten by his own 244 not out in Melbourne seven years later. England racked up 517-1 to save the Test and put Australia on the back foot.\"It was my 14th Test hundred, but the first time when it felt like I had really contributed and made a difference,\" says Cook.\"It gave us a lot of belief the Australian team were there for the taking. We got out of jail, but in a way that gave us a lot of confidence.\"England capitalised on an astonishing first morning of the second Test in Adelaide. Simon Katich was run out by Trott's direct hit from the fourth ball of the match and Australia captain Ricky Ponting was out first ball to Anderson.When Anderson also nicked off Michael Clarke, Australia were 2-3 and never recovered. The home side spiralled to 245 all out, leaving England one over to bat at the end of the first day.\"We got into the changing room and Flower asked if we were having a nightwatchman,\" says Cook.\"If Jimmy Anderson opened the batting, got out, then I went out to bat, imagine the stick I'd have got from the Australians when they were pumped up.\"Straussy usually took the first ball, but I said to him 'I'm going out there now and will face the first ball. You do what you want'.\"He said 'OK. I'll do it as well'.\"Cook followed up his Brisbane heroics with 148 in a Test remembered for Kevin Pietersen dismantling the Australian attack in his 227. Off-spinner Graeme Swann took five wickets in the second innings to bowl England to victory just before the heavens opened on the fifth day.\"After struggling the whole last summer, I was hungry for runs, and there's no better place to be hungry than a flat Adelaide pitch in 40-degree heat,\" says Cook.\"The KP double hundred was a real marker of dominance, of taking Australia down. He led it, the team got ahead of the game. He hammered Australia into the ground.\"England could have retained the Ashes in Perth, only for Mitchell Johnson to foreshadow the havoc he would cause four years later.England bowled out Australia for 268 and reached 78-0 in reply before Johnson got going. The left-armer took nine wickets in the match and England lost by 267 runs.\"We had a team meeting straight after and I wasn't sure it was the right thing to do,\" says Cook.\"It turned out to be the right move. Flower wanted us to look at how we lost the game.\"Did we take our eyes off what we were doing and started to think about the end result? Did we think we had done all the hard work and were going to win? Maybe we were thinking about retaining the Ashes there in Perth. I don't know.\"There were questions we maybe didn't have the answer to, but it was important to get them out. We went to Melbourne and the Perth game was buried. It was 1-1 and it became a two-match series.\"Australia were flying, there were pictures of Ricky Ponting all over the newspapers, people were saying we were done.\"What followed was perhaps England's single greatest day of Ashes cricket in Australia.At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the 100,000-seater cathedral of Australian sport, and on Boxing Day, the highlight of the calendar in this country, the home side were blown away for 98. England - Cook and Strauss - were 157-0 at the close.\"If Carlsberg did Boxing Days, it was that. There was disbelief at the end of the day,\" says Cook. \"Me and Strauss cleared the MCG with our batting - most people wanted to go home when we were batting together.\"The Aussies are very proud of how many people they can get to the MCG on Boxing Day. By the end there were only 20,000 English people watching me and Strauss grind it around Melbourne.\"If I could go back through my career and play any one day over again, that would be right up there because of what we did as a group.\"Trott made 168 and England won by an innings and 157 runs. They celebrated retaining the Ashes with a sprinkler dance on the MCG outfield.\"I felt a little bit uneasy doing it, because we hadn't gone there to retain the Ashes - we'd gone there to win,\" says Cook.\"I enjoyed the dressing room in Melbourne and a few of the lads went out and enjoyed a night with the Barmy Army, but we hadn't finished yet.\"A result of 2-2 would have felt a bit of an injustice. However good Melbourne was, we still had Sydney.\"Fuelled by the focus to win the urn, Cook was at it again at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His 189 lifted England to 644, their highest total in a Test in Australia.The question was not if England would win the match and the Ashes, but when.\"The fourth evening, Chris Tremlett bounced out Brad Haddin and brought Mitchell Johnson to the wicket,\" says Cook.\"The song the Barmy Army sang, I've never heard anything like it. I spoke to Tremmers and he said 'I'm just going to bowl this as fast as I can'. He bowled an absolute jaffa to Johnson, and it bowled him. I've never heard noise like it.\"England took the extra half an hour on that fourth evening, but could not get over the line.The fifth morning was a victory procession. The Barmy Army and the rest of the travelling supporters were joined in the SCG by every ex-pat and backpacker in Sydney for an English Ashes party.\"The atmosphere was incredible,\" says Cook. \"It felt like an age, I was desperate to take the final wicket.\"When Tremlett got Michael Beer out to win the match, it was a moment of pure elation, just incredible.\"It was so early in the day, we had so much time to soak it in. I don't know when we left the ground, but we stayed for absolutely ages, on the outfield and in the changing rooms. It was very, very special.\"Cook was player of the series. The remaining seven years of his Test career were illuminated by other milestones: a starring performance in the 2012 series win in India, winning the Ashes as captain in 2015 and breaking the England records for most Test runs and hundreds.There were low moments, too, most notably the humiliating 5-0 defeat in Australia when he was captain in 2013-14.Following his international retirement in 2018, Cook was knighted for services to cricket. That service was best delivered on the 2010-11 tour of Australia.\"I couldn't have played any better,\" he says. \"I was very lucky to have been part of that team, achieving something rare for England in Australia.\"When you win games of cricket, it is unbelievably special. It was hard work, but international sport is hard work.\"It was such a good team to be part of. Flower and Strauss were tough, and that regime was very regimented, but we had the time of our lives there.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoAndrew Harding,Paris correspondentandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterFrance has agreed to start intercepting small boats in the Channel, following months of pressure from the UK.The change in policy comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote to President Emmanuel Macron urging him to back the plan and saying we currently \"have no effective deterrent\" in the Channel, according to a report in Le Monde.French security forces will be allowed to stop the small boats at sea, but only before they've picked up their passengers, the maritime police force has confirmed to the BBC.  French police have rarely intervened to stop the overcrowded boats leaving the coastline because it is considered too great a risk to both officers and civilians.Le Monde reported Sir Keir's letter as reading: \"It is essential that we deploy these tactics this month... We have no effective deterrent in the Channel.\"Now, a French maritime police spokesperson says officers will start intervening at sea, with the aim of safeguarding human life.Notably, the spokesperson ruled out the use of nets to intercept boats, which Le Monde has previously reported could be used to snarl the propellers of the boats.The decision to intervene at all is a significant step forward, following a short-lived change towards a more aggressive approach this summer, driven by former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.The BBC reported in March that Retailleau wanted these interceptions to begin - but had conceded it was a difficult issue for his government to solve because of their maritime policing rules.In the run-up to July's summit between Sir Keir and President Macron, the BBC witnessed French police wading into the sea south of Boulogne to slash the sides of a boat.But interventions then dropped off, and on the UK side there seems to be surprise that it has taken so long to resolve the problems Retailleau had already identified and said he would fix.Now French authorities will again be allowed to intercept boats before they pick up migrant passengers from the beaches of northern France, although it's not clear how the small boats will be stopped. Strong winds are currently delaying the start of interceptions and the people-smuggling gangs will be looking for ways to adapt to avoid interception, as they have done so often in the past.A UK government spokesperson said: \"We continue to work closely with our French partners on the shared challenge of illegal migration, and we have already worked to ensure officers in France review their maritime tactics so they can intervene in the shallow waters.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "A search is under way for a British man who fell overboard from a cruise ship off the coast of Tenerife. The Spanish coastguard said it had been coordinating search and rescue efforts for the 76-year-old since 09:48 local time (09:48 GMT) on Thursday.The incident happened on the Marella Explorer 2, operated by TUI, while it was located just north-west of the Spanish island.TUI's Marella Cruises said the man was \"seen entering the water while the ship was on passage to La Gomera\", adding that it was supporting his family and working with local authorities.In a statement, the coastguard said the ship participated in the search before docking in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the early hours of Friday. Rescue boats, two helicopters and a specialist search and rescue aircraft have been deployed to the area.Lesley-Anne Kelly, a passenger on the ship, recalled the moment an alarm sounded while she was having breakfast with her mother on Thursday morning.Speaking to PA news agency, she said the alarm was followed by an announcement of \"man overboard\".Mrs Kelly said the captain told passengers the ship had to stay in place until the coastguard allowed it to leave, and later announced that the search had been stood down due to darkness.\"It was pretty sombre last night, especially after the announcement that they were standing down the search,\" she said.Passengers were told that witnesses were being interviewed, she added.Mrs Kelly said she believed people \"had clearly seen it happen\", adding: \"It was breakfast time. Everybody was up and about. It was pretty bright, so yeah I can imagine if someone had gone in at that time of the day they would have been seen by multiple people.\" Local media reports say the ship was on its way back to the Canary Islands from the Portuguese island of Madeira when the incident happened. It is believed to have departed Tenerife on 21 November for a seven-day tour around the Canaries and other nearby islands.The BBC has contacted the Foreign Office for comment.The Malta-registered Marella Explorer 2 holds up to 1814 passengers across its 14 decks and 907 cabins, according to TUI's website.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe education secretary has defended Labour's U-turn over offering all workers the right to claim unfair dismissal from their first day in a job.Instead, ministers now plan to reduce the qualifying period from the current two years to six months, in line with a deal agreed by some unions and industry groups.Bridget Phillipson told the BBC the climbdown was a \"pragmatic\" move to ensure \"wider benefits\" in Labour's employment rights bill could be delivered on time.The decision has been welcomed by business organisations, but has faced criticism from some MPs on the left of the Labour Party. Currently, after two continuous years in a job workers gain additional legal protections against being sacked. Employers must identify a fair reason for dismissal - such as conduct or capability - and show that they acted reasonably and followed a fair process.Under Labour's original plan, this qualifying period would have been abolished completely, with a new legal probation period, likely to have been nine months, introduced as a safeguard for companies.But business groups argued the plan could prove unworkable, and voiced concerns that day-one unfair dismissal rights would discourage firms from hiring.In a surprise announcement on Thursday, the government confirmed it will now bring in unfair dismissal protection after six months, and ditch the new legal probation period.'Big step forward'Ministers are continuing to insist the move does not breach Labour's general election manifesto - even though the document clearly commits the party to creating \"basic rights from day one to parental leave, sick pay, and protection from unfair dismissal\".When the Commons debated the employment bill in September, Business Secretary Peter Kyle told MPs: \"We were elected on a manifesto to provide protection from unfair dismissal from day one of employment\".But on Thursday, he said the move was not a breach, since the party had also committed to \"bring people together\" over the issue.The minister, who is responsible for Labour's employment legislation, also argued it was \"not my job to stand in the way\" of an agreed approach brokered between some unions and business groups.Ministers are also arguing the U-turn would unblock the passage of its wider employment rights bill through Parliament.Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers have twice teamed up with crossbenchers in the House of Lords to insist on a six-month period instead, delaying its progress. The Conservatives have said the legislation is \"still not fit for purpose\", whilst the Lib Dems said the law had been \"rushed and mired in problems from the get-go\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Phillipson said the deadlock over unfair dismissal could have \"jeopardised\" the bill, which also contains new worker benefits, such as immediate rights to sick pay and paternity leave.The move to lower the unfair dismissal qualifying period from two years to six months was still a \"big step forward,\" she added.\"Sometimes in life, you have to be pragmatic to secure wider benefits\".'Absolutely a breach'The U-turn was universally welcomed by groups representing British industry, who had warned that fears over day-one dismissal rights had led to a stall in hiring new workers.Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"I can't emphasise too much that this part of the bill was the most important thing to put right.\"So far, the reaction to the manifesto breach has been reserved to MPs on the left Labour Party.However, the Labour leadership will be less comfortable if former deputy PM Angela Rayner - the architect of the initial proposals - expresses criticism. She has not responded to requests for comment.The U-turn has received an angry reaction from the Unite union, a major Labour donor through the affiliation fees its members pay to the party.The union's boss Sharon Graham told the BBC it was \"absolutely a breach\" of the party's election manifesto, adding she feared \"further watering down\" of the employment bill in the future.The business department confirmed on Thursday that it still plans to bring in day-one sick pay and paternity leave rights from April 2026.However, it is yet to confirm a start date for the new 6-month period, which it is understood will not be specified in the employment bill itself either.It had previously committed to implementing the right from day one from 2027, under a \"roadmap\" unveiled over the summer.The government does not need to pass the employment rights bill to change the qualifying period - it already has powers to do this under existing legislation, which the coalition government used in 2012 to up the period to the current two years.But writing the changes into a full Act of Parliament was meant to prevent the new rights being easily unpicked by a future government.On Thursday, the business department said it was still committed to doing this, as a means to \"further strengthen\" the new protections.",

    "body": "16 hours agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesAll domestic cats (Felis catus) are descended from the African wild catIn true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place.A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. \"They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,\" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford.\"That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago.\" Getty ImagesCats were domesticated long after dogsAll modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat.How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists.To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats.The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa.\"Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,\" said Prof Larson.  Ziyi Li and Wenquan FanThe skull of a leopard cat found in a Han-dynasty tomb in Xinzheng City, Henan Province, ChinaThis fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies.Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought.They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China.Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica.GettyThe leopard cat is the most widespread wild cat in AsiaAnd in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene.These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years.The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially \"commensal\" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. \"Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,\" she said.GettyThe Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) with domestic catsLeopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia.Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s.The research is published in the journal, Science and in Cell Genomics.",

    "body": "49 minutes agoArchie Mitchell,Business reporter,Peter Ruddick,Business reporterandJosh Martin,Business reporterPhil ThorleyPhil Thorley said he is facing soaring business rates billsThe owner of a small pub chain in the south east of England has said his costs will rise by £62,000 per year after changes announced in the Budget.Phil Thorley, who runs the Thorley Taverns pub group, said business rates - a tax on commerical properties -  will rise for 17 of his 18 sites,  despite Rachel Reeves promising lower taxes for retail, leisure and hospitality firms.Reeves had vowed to introduce the lowest taxes since 1991 for pubs, restaurants and small shops by increasing the levy on higher-value properties such as warehouses used by Amazon and other online giants.The government said changes it had made meant it was saving most \"typical independent pubs\" £4,800 per year.A firm's rateable value is based on how much it would cost to rent a firm's property for a year, and is used to calculate a business's rates bill.The government said it will calculate business rates for 750,000 High Street retail and hospitality firms using a lower percentage of the rateable value of premises, but this lower tax rate was not as generous as expected.At the same time, many firms have seen their rateable value increase and face the phasing out of a Covid-era 40% discount from April.The net result is that, despite some transitional relief, lots of them will see significant increases in their business rates bill.Analysis by tax advisory firm Ryan suggested the average small shop will see its business rates bill increase by 42%, restaurants will face a 45% jump and bills for pubs will be 66% higher.Mr Thorley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the rateable value at most of his sites had \"gone north\". \"What it means to a small little family company like ours is that our actual payable rates is going to be going up by some 27%,\" he said. \"A further £62,000 worth of costs onto the business, which is absolutely at its knees at the moment.\"He said the industry was already under significant pressure following the chancellor's first Budget last October, which pushed up hiring costs with a hike in employer national insurance contributions and the minimum wage.Mr Thorley said another minimum wage hike will mean \"less employment, less investment, less training in the people that we've got, and less jobs for young people\".And he warned the chancellor's Budget would \"be the death knell to the British pub\".'More closures could follow'The government said it is protecting pubs, restaurants and cafes with a £4.3bn package of support, limiting firms' business rates bills.A Treasury spokesperson said: \"This comes on top of cutting the cost of licensing to help more offer pavement drinks and al fresco dining, keeping our cut to alcohol duty on draught pints and capping corporation tax.\"But Elaine Wrigley, the owner of Atlas Bar in Manchester, said Reeves' latest Budget was \"smoke and mirrors\".She told the BBC the rateable value of her bar, used to calculate its business rates bill, has jumped from £69,000 in 2023 to £97,000. And she said that even with lower multipliers for small retail, leisure and hospitality firms she is still facing a 15% increase in her business rates bill.\"She may well have said it's the lowest rate and the best support but it's from the highest base,\" Ms Wrigley said.She added: \"We've put our prices up four times in the last 12 months, but we're at a point now where we feel like we can't put any more on to our customers, so subsequently our margins are being reduced and being squeezed which is not helpful.\"And Sacha Lord, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said the business rates changes amount to a \"stealth tax\" on High Street pubs, restaurants and bars.He told the BBC operators initially welcomed the Budget, but the impact of revaluations became clear within hours of the chancellor's statement.\"Once this kicks in in April, we are expecting to see more closures than ever before, including during the pandemic,\" Mr Lord warned.",

    "body": "Runaway nuns can stay in Alpine convent if they leave social media1 hour agoBethany Bell/BBCSister Rita (L),  Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette have gained a substantial following for their social media postsThree Austrian nuns in their 80s who ran away from the old people's home where they were placed have been told they can stay in their former convent \"until further notice\".However, Church authorities say they can only stay if they stop posting on social media.Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, who is 86 and 82-year-old Sister Rita are the last three nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, just outside Salzburg.The three nuns say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023.In September, they moved back in with the help of former students and a locksmith, angering Church officials.The nuns' superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, called on them to return to the care home, saying their decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\".The nuns' story sparked worldwide interest. Supporters helped them with food, electricity and social media, posting videos of the nuns' daily lives.These feature the nuns at prayer or at lunch, and include Sister Rita's exercise workouts. She was recently given a pair of boxing gloves.The Goldenstein nuns have amassed almost 100,000 followers on Instagram and several thousand on Facebook.Now after almost three months of standoff, a spokesman for the Provost, Harald Schiffl, has told Austrian Press Agency APA that the nuns can stay for now.It follows a meeting earlier this week, where a proposed solution to the standoff was suggested.The nuns could stay at the Kloster Goldenstein, Harald Schiffl told APA, but only under certain conditions.These include giving up their social media activities.Church officials also want the nuns to ensure that the enclosed part of the convent will no longer be accessible to people who do not belong to the order.In return, they will be allowed to stay and be provided with medical care and spiritual support from a priest.BBC/Bethany BellThe three nuns have lived in Schloss Goldenstein for decadesThe nuns have yet to agree to the conditions.\"Now it's up to the sisters,\" Harald Schiffl told APA.The BBC has contacted them for a response.The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning.Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was Austrian actress Romy Schneider, one of the world's biggest film stars of the 1960s and 70s.Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958 and Sister Rita in 1962.All three nuns went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress.But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reicherberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey became the nuns' superior and the community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024.The remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they felt unhappy.At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students.The nuns told the BBC at the time that they were determined to stay.\"Before I die in that old people's home, I would rather go to a meadow and enter eternity that way,\" said Sister Bernadette.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editorandJames Waterhouse,Ukraine correspondentGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesAndriy Yermak (L) has been Zelensky's chief of staff for more than five yearsUkraine's anti-corruption agencies have begun searching the apartment of President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak.One of the two agencies, anti-corruption bureau Nabu, confirmed that its investigative searches had been authorised and said further details would follow.A corruption scandal has engulfed several figures close to Zelensky, though neither he nor his right-hand man Yermak have been accused of any wrongdoing. Andriy Yermak is the president's closest aide and has had his ear throughout Russia's full-scale invasion. He is also Kyiv's lead negotiator in peace talks with the US, but his position has come increasingly under threat from critics calling for him to go.Yermak, 54, confirmed on social media that both Nabu and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) were \"conducting procedural actions at my home\" and had full access to his apartment, with his lawyers on site.\"From my side, there is full co-operation,\" said the chief of staff, who has not been named as a suspect.The searches come at a very awkward moment for Zelensky and his closest ally, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with a draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week.One of the main sticking points for Ukraine is Russia's demand for Ukraine to hand over the territory it still controls in the eastern Donetsk region. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.Yermak, who wields enormous influence at the top of government in Kyiv, underlined his leading role in the negotiations when he told The Atlantic website hours before news of the searches emerged that \"as long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory\".However, Putin has been emboldened by minor territorial gains by Russian forces, claiming their offensive \"is practically impossible to hold back\". Meanwhile, Zelensky's own position has been weakened by the domestic corruption scandal, and Russia's president has long questioned his legitimacy as leader. The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine this month, with investigators linking  several leading public figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector.The two anti-corruption agencies, Nabu and Sap, said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Domestically, the corruption inquiry probe is being welcomed, but internationally it leaves Ukraine's negotiating position in a potentially perilous state.Russian officials involved in the draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Among Ukrainians, Andriy Yermak's own popularity has nose-dived. MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggests 70% of the public want him to resign.A number of suspects have already been charged over the scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.Russian attacks have badly damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.In his interview late on Thursday, Yermak acknowledged that pressure on him to stand down was \"enormous... The case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\". Zelensky has already fired two ministers and several suspects have been detained in the scandal. One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has fled the country. He was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.Despite not being implicated and denying any involvement, Yermak has struggled to distance himself from the scandal.",

    "body": "At least 128 people have died in a devastating fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong.A further 79 people have been injured in the city's deadliest blaze in more than 70 years, which occurred in the northerly suburb of Tai Po, while dozens remain missing.The tower blocks had been undergoing renovations when the fire began. The cause of the blaze remains unclear but officials said on Friday that Styrofoam placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its rapid spread.Three people overseeing the renovations are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.Follow updates on this storyBringing the fire - which spread across seven of Wang Fuk Court's eight apartment blocks - under control involved more than 2,311 firefighters. Firefighting efforts have now ceased. The fire was fully extinguished by 10:18 local time (02:18 GMT) on Friday, the fire department said in a news conference.It also said 89 bodies have yet to be identified, and 16 bodies remain inside the buildings.Authorities said police will begin entering the Wang Fuk Court buildings on Friday to start gathering evidence, and that an investigation will take place over the next three to four weeks.Meanwhile, crowds have been gathering at a nearby community hall that has been opened to families looking for missing loved ones. Relatives are being asked to help with the identification process by bringing in family photos.The Hong Kong government has also set up shelters and support centres for displaced residents. Groups of volunteers have been packing and organising supplies for those affected, including clothing and hygiene products.The blaze started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, and by 18:22 local time it had been upgraded to the most serious category by fire officials.The fire department said the fire started at a lower level before moving upwards, and reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F).As a result, the blaze reignited in some places after being doused, they said.The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of flammable netting and other materials on the outside of the buildings.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.Twelve other firefighters have also been injured, authorities said.Two Indonesian nationals who had been working on the buildings were also killed in the fire, a migrant charity said. Indonesian and Filipino workers are among those still unaccounted for.Shock has quickly shifted to anger in Hong Kong, as questions grow on who should be held accountable for the blaze.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Meanwhile, one resident told the BBC that some of the alarms had been turned off by construction workers.Reports of residents' prior complaints over high renovation fees and whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations have also resurfaced and are circulating widely online. \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.",

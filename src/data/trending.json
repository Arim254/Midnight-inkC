    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge4 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a key-note speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the west, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the United States had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation, and his, had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules, a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the United States to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the Imperial Citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the Barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity… And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at Davos last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a WhatsApp group that included Vice President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\"We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the United States from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the United States will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have, ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention, to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength: a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's Prime Minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu\".Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Colombia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the United States, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial Shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing president Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them: the US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the Doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"In the Guatemala coup, in 1954, that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini.\"The coup on Chile in 1971 [against the left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende] wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup.\"During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the United States would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary General of Nato Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president had receivedBut Trump's approach to towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden also believed the European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act: in response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around two per cent of GDP to five per cent, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos he said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Chanel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I too make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, AI.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder: democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena; they are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "9 minutes agoBBCThe Observer leads with news of Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham who it says has kicked off the \"contest for No 10\". A picture of him and Sir Keir face to face is headlined \"heated rivalry\", riffing off of the popular television show about a romance between two Canadian ice hockey players. Burnham \"throws down the gauntlet\", the Sunday Times says, with his bid to run in the Gordon and Denton by-election. The mayor shared his \"difficult decision\" in a letter posted on X. Also on the Times's front, a photo from Minneapolis of tear gas being fired into the air as there's \"another death in Minnesota clashes\".The Sunday Telegraph says Sir Keir faces \"civil war\" within Labour after Burnham's bid for the by-election. It also reveals that the Duke of Sussex's stalker was \"behind him in court last week\" as he attended his privacy trial against the publisher of the Daily Mail. The Mail also headlines on the latest in the \"Labour civil war\" with \"Starmer is cornered\". The \"beleaguered\" PM faces a \"stark choice\" either to \"block\" Burnham or \"face a leadership challenge\". And there's more on the Beckhams as Victoria \"hits back over that dance\" which her son Brooklyn had said was \"inappropriate\" at his wedding.There is \"army shock\" after \"Trump backs down\" writes The Sun on Sunday. The US president hailed British troops as \"among the greatest warriors in the world\". The paper says this came after King Charles passed his \"concern\" to the White House over Trump's \"slur on Nato troops\". And in a Beckham family exclusive, the Sun says the \"Brooklyn rift goes back many years\". The Daily Star marks Trump's \"U-turn\" after saying British troops stayed off the front lines in Afghanistan by noting that Sir Rod Stewart was among those criticising the \"orange manbaby\". It headlines with a take on one of his songs: \"Have I told you lately that I hate you?\"In the lead for the Sunday Express is a warning from a former head of MI6 that Russia will \"step up\" attacks on the UK as part of an \"undeclared war\" on the West. Richard Dearlove told the paper that Russia is capable of mounting \"very aggressive\" attacks because they \"do not care\" about political risk. \"Britain to have its own FBI\" headlines the Sunday People in a \"police shake-up\". Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will make the announcement tomorrow, it reports.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe.The man, named as \"Mohammad S\", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening.Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions.He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention.Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries.The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action.German authorities say \"Mohammad S\" colluded with \"Abed Al G\", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions.The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon.Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported.Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.",

    "body": "15 hours agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

So we were in a little convoy of blown tyres.\"It was actually a moment when I thought we're not going to make it to the finish,\" she said.Luckily, the Germans had large equipment so they could change the Land Rover's tyres and helped make sure Kirk and Tait-Wright were on the final stretch to the finish line.A.S.O./Aurélien VialatteKirk and Tait-Wright had to drive through a range of terrains, including sand dunes\"They helped us get back on our way, we set off but we still had 80 kilometres to do without any spares.\"The worry was then if we blew another tyre, that was it. That was our Dakar over,\" Kirk said.However, the pair managed to get to the end without further issues despite not having spare tyres and the \"steering being out\".\"A lot of people thought we wouldn't get here. \"It's been awesome, all the support has just been out of this world. \"All the messages kept us going and it gave us a big push to the end,\" said Kirk.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe new body will buy technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all police forcesA new national police force is being created to take over counter-terror, fraud, and criminal gang investigations.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the new National Police Service (NPS), described as a \"British FBI\", would deploy \"world class talent and state of the art technology to track down and catch dangerous criminals\".It will bring the work of existing agencies such as the National Crime Agency and regional organised crime units under the same organisation, buying new technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all forces.Mahmood said policing was stuck \"in a different century\" and the new body will form part of a series of police reforms she will unveil on Monday.The NPS will cover England and Wales but be able to operate in the wider UK, setting standards and training. It will be led by a national police commissioner who will become the most senior police chief in the country.The Home Office said local police officers have been \"burdened\" with tackling major crimes without adequate training, leaving them unable to address everyday offences like shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.In the past week, the home secretary has announced a number of sweeping changes to policing, having described the current structures as \"irrational\".Counter terror policing, led by the Metropolitan Police, the National Air Service run by West Yorkshire Police, and National Roads Policing will also all be brought under the new organisation. Intelligence and resources will be shared across different forces in stages to ensure the public receive the same level of security \"no matter where they live\", the Home Office said in a statement.While the government claims facial recognition has led to a rapid reduction in crime - reportedly leading to 1,700 arrests in the past two years - campaigners have raised concerns over issues with bias and privacy.The Home Office says it will also look to hire new talent outside of the force for leadership roles. Labour wants to shake up the police - but will that solve 'everyday crime epidemic'?Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, backed the new national force and said \"the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change\".He added: \"These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response.\"Mahmood has previously said the current policing structure is \"irrational\", announcing on Thursday that she intends to drastically cut police forces down from 43 to make way for 12 \"mega\" forces.And on Friday, the government announced details of a licence scheme for police officers, and increased powers for ministers to intervene where police and fire chiefs are deemed to be failing.The plans have drawn mixed reaction from senior figures in policing, with the Police Federation warning that \"fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities\".The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also warned that the creation of regional forces would be expensive, time-consuming and risks separating police forces from their communities.In November, ministers announced plans to scrap police and crime commissioners in 2028 to save at least £100m and help fund neighbourhood policing.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a \"strategic partnership\" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move \"a good thing\". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured.Carney also urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", though he did not mention Trump by name.Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace.On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken\". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment.Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: \"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China.\"\"What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues.\"LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships \"throughout the world\".Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will  tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada.Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".",

    "body": "Home bakery helps mum cope with 'timebomb illness'6 days agoJim Scottin Hetton-le-HoleBBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson said she had been inundated with support for her cake shedA mother who described her inoperable brain condition as a \"ticking timebomb\" said opening an \"honest\" bakery in a shed at her home was helping her to cope.Megan Jackson, from Hetton-le-Hole, Sunderland, bakes and displays her own treats with an honesty box, which trusts customers to pay the correct amount of money while unattended.The registered nurse, who is on maternity leave after having her son Albie, was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm - a swollen blood vessel - after suffering extreme headaches.She said baking was her \"coping mechanism\" and she was touched that hundreds of people had visited her shed. Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

    "body": "10 hours agoKate WhannelPA MediaAndy Burnham has announced that he is seeking permission to stand in the upcoming Gorton and Denton parliamentary by-election.If he won and became an MP, Burnham could mount a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer but the BBC has been told that allies of the prime minister may try and block him from standing in the constituency. Burnham is currently mayor of Greater Manchester and in a statement insisted that he wants to back the Labour government \"not undermine it\", adding that the decision had been \"difficult\".The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after Andrew Gwynne stood down on Friday as an MP on health grounds.As a directly-elected mayor, Burnham has to get approval from Labour's ruling national executive committee before he can enter the race to be the party's candidate. That decision is expected on Sunday.Several Labour MPs have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Burnham could be blocked from standing in the by-election.Burnham had until Saturday afternoon to submit his application and on the dot of the 5pm deadline, he shared his letter to the NEC on social media, ending days of speculation over what he was planning. In his letter, Burnham said there was a \"direct threat to everything Greater Manchester has always been about from a brand of politics which seeks to pit people against each other\".\"I see this by-election as the frontline of that fight for the Manchester Way and I feel I owe it to a city which has given me so much to lead it from the front, despite the risks involved.\"He said he had left Westminster nearly a decade ago because he believed \"it wasn't working for people in our part of the world\" and that as mayor he had \"tried to pioneer a different way of doing things\".However, he added that he believed Manchester \"won't be able to be everything it should be without similar changes at a national level.\"This is why I feel the need to go back.\"There has been speculation that the prime minister could face a leadership challenge, after the May elections, which will see votes take place in the Welsh Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and in some local councils in England.Burnham has been touted as a possible leadership contender but can only mount a challenge if he is an MP in the Commons.In his letter to the NEC, Burnham insisted he would be in Parliament \"to support the work of the government, not undermine it\".\"I have passed this assurance on to the prime minister.\"Some senior Labour figures in the party have said they believe Burnham should be allowed to enter the contest. London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said: \"If Andy Burnham wants to be a member of Parliament, Andy Burnham should be allowed to be a member of Parliament\".Indicating her support for Burnham, deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell said the by-election would be \"difficult\" and that she wanted \"to make sure we are putting the best team out on the pitch week after week\".\"I don't want to see [Erling] Haaland on the bench\" in a reference to the Manchester City football player. She also said Labour members should \"get behind Keir Starmer\" adding that she did not want to see the by-election develop into \"in-fighting and talking about ourselves\".Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Burnham would be \"a massive asset\" in Parliament and that he hoped Gorton and Denton party members would have \"the option\" of selecting him as a candidate.Burnham's fate now lies in the hands of the officers on the NEC which include Starmer and Powell alongside Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, party chair Ellie Reeves and trade union representatives.A decision to turn down his application risks infuriating those MPs in Parliament who support the Greater Manchester mayor.Blackpool South MP Chris Webb said blocking Burnham would have \"serious lasting consequences\" adding: \"When you're 2-0 down at half time, you bring on the super sub to help the team win.\"East Hull MP Karl Turner said it would \"cause the most raving row\".If he were to be selected and won the Gorton and Denton seat, Burnham would have to resign as Greater Manchester mayor, triggering a new election for that role.Several Labour sources have said the NEC could block Burnham's application on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive for the party. It would also be costly for the taxpayer with the last mayoral election costing around £4.7m. The area of Gorton and Denton has traditionally voted Labour and the party won the seat in 2024 with a majority of 13,000.However, since then the party's popularity has declined and Labour could face challenges from Reform UK and the Green Party who came second and third at the general election.Shortly after, Burnham made his intentions clear, Reform's Lee Anderson posted a picture of himself campaigning in Gorton and Denton with the message \"bring it on\".",

    "body": "The Liberal Democrats are calling on the government to start issuing \"war bonds\", a scheme the party says could raise up to £20bn to bolster the military. Under the plan, members of the public could loan the government money in the form of a bond which would run over a two-to-three year period and pay out the same interest as standard government bonds. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the bonds would \"give ordinary people the opportunity to contribute to Britain's security\". A spokesperson for the government said \"new debt instruments\" were kept under review but that they had to represent \"value for money\" and \"be consistent with wider fiscal objectives\". Calls to increase defence spending have intensified in recent years, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the election of US President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticised Nato countries for failing to spend enough on their military. The Labour government has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, at an estimated cost of an additional £6bn a year.It has also promised to raise levels to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge by Nato members last year. However, there have been reports in the Times and the Sun that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require £28bn more than has so far been allocated.The government had been due to publish its defence investment plan last autumn but there are suggestions it has been delayed due to concerns about cost.Earlier this month, the head of the Armed Forces Sir Richard Knighton said the UK was \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\".Setting out his party's proposal, Sir Ed said: \"Now is the moment to be clear-eyed about the threats facing Britain - Vladimir Putin is waging war in Europe while Donald Trump is tearing up the rules and alliances that keep us safe.He said Britain and its allies \"must rapidly strengthen our defences to deter the likes of Putin... it is much better to invest now in deterring a war than having to fight one\".The Liberal Democrats said the money raised from issuing bonds would be ring-fenced for defence and the investment would help deliver \"growth, jobs and higher revenues\" for the government \"which would partially offset the cost of additional debt servicing\".The party added the scheme would need to be accompanied by an overhaul of the Ministry of Defence procurement process, which has previously been criticised as wasteful. Their proposal, the party says, would be similar to the bonds scheme used during World War One and World War Two. Individual citizens could lend the government money, which would be paid back in six to 10 years with interest. By the end of 1945, the scheme had raised £1.754m.Posters encouraging members of the public to buy bonds - or national savings certificates - used slogans including \"lend to defend\" and \"feed the guns with war bonds\". Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investors AJ Bell, said: \"War bonds are a proven way of raising money to fund national defence spending, but they can burden a government with long-term debt. \"In theory, the public might demand a better rate of interest than they could get on cash in the bank to take up the bonds. \"While some people might think it is their duty to support the country, there will be others who treat such a bond in the same way as any type of investment.\" ",

    "body": "2 hours agoIsaac AsheEast MidlandsSuppliedThe woman, who did not wish to be identified, said she \"felt sick\" after finding the device hidden underneath the seat of a toilet she had just usedA woman has said she felt \"violated\" after finding a live-streaming camera hidden inside a toilet she had been using while on a date at a restaurant.The 32-year-old mother-of-one was on a date night with her partner at Thai restaurant Giggling Squid in St Martin's Square, Leicester, between Christmas and new year when she made the discovery and alerted staff.Leicestershire Police was notified and carried out an investigation, but no arrests have yet been made by the force.The victim told the BBC: \"It makes me feel sick - I've tried to disassociate myself from it but whoever has done that has won, they have that of me now.\"The NHS worker had visited the restaurant on 30 December for a meal when, after eating, she needed to use the bathroom.But after using a toilet inside a cubicle, she realised there was a black camera - with kitchen roll wrapped around it - under the toilet seat with a black lens visible. The camera was later found to be connected to the internet.She said: \"I turned around and I looked down and I saw this black round dot - it was a bit out of place because the toilet's white.\"It was just there, a small camera, some wires coming off of it, and then a battery pack with kitchen roll over it, and my stomach just sank.\"The thought of someone watching, especially in such a private area, scared me. It's a really uncomfortable thing to think about, that somebody's got that now.\"There must have been so many people visiting that toilet.\"The victim had been on a date night when she found the device under the toilet seat at the Giggling Squid restaurantLeicestershire Police said it was notified the following day about the webcam at the restaurant chain.A spokesperson said: \"Officers attended and the device was recovered for examination.\"Further inquiries were carried out regarding CCTV in the restaurant and staff were spoken to in order to try and identify the person responsible.\"Advice has also been given to staff about remaining vigilant.\"A spokesperson for Giggling Restaurants, the company that runs the restaurant, said a customer had reported a \"suspicious object\" to staff on the night it was found.They said: \"Our staff did the right thing and informed police right away, who now have the item in their possession.\"We are co-operating fully with their inquiries.\"The restaurant said it was \"co-operating fully\" with the police investigationThe victim added she hoped sharing her experience would save other people from being targeted.\"I'm trying to get people to think when they go in public situations, look everywhere, even in places that we wouldn't even think would be unsafe,\" she said.\"When I've spoken to people about it, it's not something that anybody's ever thought about, nobody looks at under the toilet seats or has a little scan before they use the toilet.\"If this helps somebody spot it before it can escalate, then great.\"Related internet links",

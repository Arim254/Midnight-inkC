    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Verstappen is aiming to equal Michael Schumacher's record of winning five consecutive F1 drivers' championshipsByF1 Correspondent in AustinFor the first time all year, Max Verstappen said after the United States Grand Prix that winning the world championship was a real possibility.It felt like a significant moment, because until now Verstappen has been dismissing the idea.That made sense during McLaren's imperious form from the beginning of the year to the end of the summer.Even when Verstappen started winning races in September, the points gap to the McLaren drivers was so big that the four-time champion refused to entertain the idea in public, even if he might have been thinking about it in private. He was taking it race by race, he said, and not thinking about the championship.Verstappen said the same thing at the start of the weekend in Austin, even though he had won two of the past three grands prix and finished second in the other. A McLaren had not finished ahead of him since the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August.After a race weekend in which Verstappen took pole and victory in both the sprint and grand prix itself, he could have said it again. He might even have been expected to. But the belief in him now was almost palpable.\"For sure, the chance is there,\" Verstappen said. \"We just need to try and deliver these kind of weekends to the end. We will try. It is exciting.\"Of course we know we need to be perfect to the end of the season to have a chance, but we will try, and if we succeed, of course amazing.\"If we don't, we tried everything we could to the end and we kept it exciting. That's the spirit for us. It's positive pressure. It's not putting anything on us. We're not stressed about it. We're just going flat out.\"Verstappen's remarkable runThe statistics of the last four races over the past month and a half are quite remarkable.After the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen was 104 points behind McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the championship, and 70 adrift of Lando Norris. Now, he is 40 points behind the Australian, whose lead over his team-mate has been cut to just 14 points.Verstappen expressed his own incredulity at what he had achieved. If someone had told him after Zandvoort this would happen, he said, \"I would have told him he was an idiot.\"But we found a good way with the car. It's simple as that. Of course, we put some upgrades on the car, but we just understood our car a bit better, where we wanted it to perform better.\"A 64-point gain in four races tells its own story, but how it has come about is just as remarkable.McLaren trounced Red Bull through the summer races in Europe - until the Italian Grand Prix in early September, when an upgraded floor and front wing finally gave Verstappen the balance he had been craving all year.Since then, the Red Bull has been the fastest car. Until this weekend in Austin, that could have been explained away through circuit characteristics - Monza, Baku and Singapore are all short, slow corners, and require good braking and traction.The McLaren's strengths are not in this area - they are in long-duration, medium-speed corners, where they crush everyone else.But Austin is a \"normal\" circuit, a road course not a street circuit, not a high-speed outlier like Monza, with a good range of corners. And Verstappen won again.There are five races left, two of them sprint events. If he keeps closing on the McLaren drivers at the rate he has been, he will win a fifth consecutive title, it's as stark and simple as that.Norris 'had the pace to win'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc battled all race over second positionThere are circuits to come that play to McLaren's strengths - Brazil, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, the team have singled out.But Verstappen's recent form brings everything into question.On Saturday in Austin, McLaren team principal Andrea Stella was saying that the Verstappen-Red Bull combination could be the fastest at every remaining track this year.By Sunday, though, Stella's tone in public had become more positive. He was encouraged, he said, by the fact that Norris \"had the pace to win the race today\".This, Stella said, had been proved on the few laps Norris was able to run his pace. Verstappen agreed.\"As soon as Lando was in clean air,\" the Dutchman said, \"it was very evenly matched or he was slightly faster. We managed to gap to the end but it was not super-easy.\"Norris' problem was that he spent the vast majority of the race stuck behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.Ferrari were the only team to pick the right strategy. Leclerc started on soft tyres, which gave him the grip off the line to pass Norris into the first corner.Most teams started on the mediums, expecting the race to be a one-stop on the medium and hard tyres. But it soon became apparent in the first stint that the cars who had started on hards were struggling.Leclerc held Norris back for the entire first stint. He pitted first, fitting the medium tyres, while the McLaren driver stayed out on his mediums. When Norris finally pitted, fitting the softs instead of the hards that had been the plan at the start of the race, he emerged behind Leclerc again, inevitably.He expected to be able to pass relatively easily, but although he caught the Ferrari quickly, Leclerc fended him off again. Norris backed off to cool his tyres and had another go, and it was not until five laps from the end that he was finally able to claim second place.Had he held on to it at the start, the race could have been very different. \"Performance-wise,\" Stella said, \"we are reassured that the pace was sufficient to fight for the victory.\"This was especially encouraging because the crash between the McLaren drivers that had taken them both out of the sprint on the first lap had cost them valuable learning.That meant McLaren had had to be conservative with their set-up, especially in terms of ride height, because they lacked the necessary data on a track where other teams have in the past been caught out by the bumps and been disqualified for excessive floor wear.McLaren had to err on the side of caution, and it inevitably cost them performance. Hence the encouragement from the fact that, despite that compromise, they were nevertheless competitive in the race.Piastri denies pressure getting to himImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oscar Piastri won seven of the first 13 races this seasonAs Verstappen closes on both McLaren drivers, so Norris has been closing on Piastri - he was 34 points behind his team-mate after Zandvoort; he has now reduced that by more than half.Piastri finished behind Norris in Monza, had a very poor weekend in Baku, and lost out in Singapore when Norris barged past him at the first corner.This weekend was different. He lacked pace from the off, never comfortable with the car, always lagging about 0.2secs behind his team-mate.\"I don't think there's an overwhelming trend that things are in a bad way,\" Piastri said. \"It's just that this weekend has been has been tough. So we'll try and understand why that was the case. And try and bounce back next week.\"He denied that the pressure was getting to him.\"No, I don't think so,\" Piastri said. \"The pressure has been there the whole year.  This weekend, I didn't really feel like I made any mistakes. It just wasn't very fast.\"There's some weekends where it just doesn't click for you. And this was one of those. When you feel like you've done a reasonable job and just the pace hasn't been there, I don't think that's really what pressure looks like.\"I've been in fights that were as close or at this point even closer than what they are now. So I've got the evidence for myself that things can still turn out well and I still fully believe that I can win the championship.\"There's still a long way to go in the championship. Max has obviously chased it down pretty quick, but it's not exactly a small gap with five rounds to go.\"Ultimately, if we can find our way again, find our pace, certainly for me find our pace again, then I don't have any major concerns.\"'Results will take care of themselves'Norris, Piastri and McLaren as a whole are heading into new territory.The drivers and the team have not fought for a drivers' title before, although Norris threatened Verstappen last year. The only exception is Stella, who is the veteran of many close battles, when he was race engineer for Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at Ferrari.His job now is to keep the team and drivers on an even keel, to try to brush off the pressure and focus on the job in hand.\"We keep talking about the fact that what we are facing in this moment - which is a tight competition to win races, a tight competition in the quest for the drivers' championship - is what Formula 1 is about,\" Stella said.\"If anything, it was anomalous when we were doing easily P1, P2, like in Barcelona, in Bahrain, and some other places. That's not what Formula 1 is about.\"It's a process of getting used to this kind of pressure, which we want to live with maximum intensity and minimum stress.\"We don't want to lose the joy of doing what we do. We just want to make sure that we put ourselves in the state in which we perform at our best, which also includes having fun and keeping recognising that ultimately it's quite a big privilege to be in this situation.\"And it's a privilege that came thanks to the good work that McLaren, the team, the two drivers, have been able to do.\"So what we do in the future is very easy. We keep doing the good work and the results will take care of themselves.\"",

    "body": "Consign my Ashes try to history - Davies' England challengeImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Jonathan Davies' try for Great Britain against Australia in 1994 is part of rugby league folkloreByMike WhalleyBBC Sport senior journalistJonathan Davies has a message for England. \"I'd love to see now another try at Wembley so they haven't got to show mine,\" he says.It is a big challenge for Shaun Wane's side as they get ready to face Australia in London on Saturday, in the first rugby league Ashes Test since 2003.Because the try that dual code rugby great Davies scored 31 years ago this week was one of the classics, a stunning 50-metre burst for the corner, in a memorable Ashes victory. Great Britain, playing with 12 men for almost an hour, beat the world champions at Wembley.That score, on a wet afternoon in October 1994, was a defining moment - for the scorer, for the sport, even for the BBC's commentator that day.The triumph it inspired is still heralded now. It's one that might offer lessons to help Wane's class of 2025. So how do you compete with the world's best?\"You have to be patient,\" Davies says. \"Don't be chasing it. Don't be pushing passes. Make sure you have a good kicking game. And keep turning the Australians. And then just hang on in there. \"It's a fight, really, and then just try to make the most of your opportunities.\"The team of 1994 had plenty of fight. Sometimes a bit too much. But they needed a thirst for battle, because they were up against it from the start.Rugby League Ashes25 October, 1 November, 8 NovemberWembley, Hill Dickinson Stadium, AMT HeadingleyWatch all three Tests live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app'That was a bit surreal - Ellery was a good pal of mine'There are several parallels between 1994 and 2025. As then, the Kangaroos arrive as World Cup holders and favourites. The first Test is at Wembley. And the build-up has been overshadowed by a head coach called Mal leaving for an Australian club job.This time around, Australia lost their boss. Mal Meninga, the captain in 1994, stepped down in June to join new NRL franchise Perth Bears. Kevin Walters - a member of the '94 touring party, though he didn't play in the Tests - has stepped in.\"Yeah, I don't think that's an issue for Australia,\" says Martin Offiah, the legendary winger who was a Great Britain team-mate of Davies in 1994. \"They've got Gorden Tallis in as their assistant, their cultural guide, who brings them all together. At international level, with the quality they've got, there are probably 100 people they could get to coach Australia and still be quite confident.\"Wind the clock back 31 years and it was Great Britain in the midst of a shake-up.Just two months before the first Test, Mal Reilly ended his seven-year reign to head down under and join Newcastle Knights.His replacement was a rugby superstar - but a coaching novice. Ellery Hanley, a three-time Man of Steel, had captained Great Britain in the 1988 and 1990 Ashes series, and had won just about everything in the club game. He had retired from international rugby, though was still playing for Leeds, where he was also assistant coach. But still only 33, he had never been a head coach.For those used to playing alongside him, the idea took getting used to.\"That was a bit surreal,\" Offiah says. \"Ellery was a good pal of mine; I'd toured with him for the first time in '88.\"But he was the consummate professional and switched into coaching mode quite easily - as he'd been a leader on the pitch as well.\"Hanley immediately made a significant call - dropping out-of-form captain Garry Schofield, his Leeds team-mate, from the matchday squad for the first Test. And so on Saturday, 22 October 1994, it was Wigan scrum-half Shaun Edwards who led the side.But less than half an hour into that first Test, the new captain was in big trouble.'He's got to go'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Shaun Edwards (right) was sent off for a high tackle on Bradley Clyde, who was later taken to hospitalAustralia's team was packed with quality: Meninga and Steve Renouf in the centres, Andrew Ettingshausen on the wing, Laurie Daley at stand-off, Alfie Langer at scrum-half, Brad Fittler at loose forward, plus more.Britain boasted an abundance of talent too, though: Davies, Offiah, Jason Robinson, Denis Betts, Andy Farrell, to name just a few. They fancied their chances.But in the 26th minute, their job got much harder. A swift passing move gave Bradley Clyde space to run. Edwards stepped across, right arm outstretched, and poleaxed the Australian second row. \"He's got to go,\" shouted former Kangaroos scrum-half Peter Sterling, summarising for Australia's Channel Nine. Referee Graham Annesley agreed. A red card for the captain.Clyde, having been replaced under the blood bin rule that allowed a temporary substitute for an injured player, came back on 10 minutes later and tried to continue.But he collapsed in the tunnel at half-time and had to be taken to hospital for a precautionary brain scan. Thankfully, he was OK.Davies says: \"I didn't realise it on the day, but if you watch it on the video, when Shaun Edwards hits him, I think I'm behind, and you can see my face. And I'm thinking: 'Oof. This is not nice.'\"And that was it, really. Shaun was absolutely distraught. But even in that era, it was a clear sending off.\"A player short, Britain still edged ahead through a Davies penalty. Then, as the clock ticked past 37 minutes, the extraordinary happened.'Ten yards out, I knew I'd done him'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Jonathan Davies ran 50 metres to give 12-man Great Britain a 6-0 lead\"Betts... to Davies! Davies! He's got some space! He's going for the corner! He's got his head back! And the Welshman... IS IN! For a magnificent try at the corner!\"Ray French, BBC TV commentary, 22 October 1994It started midway inside the Great Britain half. Bobbie Goulding broke from a scrum and set Offiah away, but he was tackled by Australia's speedy full-back Brett Mullins. From the play-the-ball, Alan Hunte, Goulding and Phil Clarke worked possession right to Betts, who fed Davies on the halfway line with a long way to go.\"I'd noticed that Mullins had got caught up in a little tussle with Alan Hunte at the play-the-ball,\" Davies recalls.\"And as the ball came out there was good wide passing, and then I straightened up a little bit and there was a little bit of a dog leg [where the defensive line is not straight], so I just threw a dummy and then all of a sudden I was in space. And it was like slow motion then.\"As soon as I hit the gap, I hit open space. And the noise just hits you. It hits you, but it doesn't affect you, because it's like playing as a kid in the field.\"And Brett Mullins was coming over and I knew that if I just checked him a little bit, leaned in with my head, and then accelerated off my left foot, that I'd have a good chance of beating him as he was out of position because of that little tussle he'd had.\"Ten yards out, I knew I'd done him.\"Wembley's best-ever try? There's some friendly disagreement there. Six months earlier, Offiah had scored an astonishing length-of-the-field try, finished in the same corner of the stadium, for Wigan against Leeds in the Challenge Cup final.\"I went through Brad Fittler and Steve Renouf, and then outside Brett Mullins,\" Davies says. \"Martin Offiah always says he scored the best try at Wembley, and I'm going: 'Hang on, who did you beat, mate? Who did you beat?'\"Offiah recalls: \"I always joke to Jiffy that he scored the second-best try ever at Wembley. And he always says that his was against better opposition. But yeah, it was an incredible score. I'd say that's the moment that Jiffy's going to be remembered for.\"Viewed in 2025, the try has a touch of poignancy. Ray French, the BBC television commentator who described it so memorably, died in July.On the night of his death, the BBC One late news ran a short tribute. There was an archive clip: Davies' try, with French's words.\"It was a really poignant moment to remember that and remember Ray as well,\" Davies says.'Davies is having a 10 out of 10 here'Remarkably, 12-man Great Britain held a 6-0 lead at half-time. Now they had to defend it.Twelve minutes into the second half, Fittler made a break to within 25 metres of the Great Britain line, with Langer in support and only Davies to beat. Surely the Kangaroos would score now.Davies had to decide fast: Go to tackle the man with the ball and leave Langer free? Or gamble on Fittler passing and go for Langer? He went to tackle Langer. It was the right call - saving a certain try.\"Davies is having a 10 out of 10 here,\" said Channel Nine commentator Ray Warren.But the full-back's afternoon was over within three minutes. In the aftermath of more extraordinary defending - Gary Connolly holding up Fittler virtually over the line - Davies helped scramble the ball clear, but suffered a dislocated shoulder as team-mate Barrie McDermott fell on him.Still Britain held their lead - only conceding when Renouf scored with eight minutes left. Test debutant David Furner missed the conversion from out wide, to the roars of the Wembley crowd, and the hosts saw the game out, with Goulding adding a late penalty to complete an 8-4 win.But Davies' injury had consequences. He missed the remaining two Tests at Old Trafford and Elland Road, which Australia won to clinch the series.\"Barrie McDermott dived on top of me and I popped my clavicle joint,\" Davies recalls. \"I didn't play for 10 weeks after. And that was a huge disappointment for me, because I felt with winning at Wembley, we could have won that series.\"'I'll take it to the grave that I didn't win an Ashes series'Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Martin Offiah played in four rugby league Ashes series - in 1988, 1990, 1992 and 1994Hanley moved on in the months after that Ashes series, to play in Australia. Davies returned to rugby union. The squad of 1994 were left with thoughts of what might have been.As it is, Australia remain unbeaten in an Ashes series since 1970. They haven't lost one in England since 1959.There have been memorable individual British victories - in Sydney in 1988, at Wembley in 1990 and 1994, and in Melbourne in 1992 - and a few close calls: Australia had to come from behind to win all three Tests in 2003. But putting it together over a whole series has proved tougher.\"That's the thing that I'll take to the grave, that I didn't win an Ashes series,\" Offiah says.\"We've had so many fantastic victories against Australia, but for some reason it didn't happen. Australia still managed to get over the line.\"'Nothing can build respect for the international game like this'After a 22-year gap, the Ashes return - albeit with a difference, as Australia will be facing England.Whether it should be Great Britain, as in every previous series dating back to the origin of the Ashes in 1908, has been a matter for debate.\"Being the traditionalist, I would still like it to be Great Britain,\" Offiah says. \"It would probably be a similar team anyway, but I think the brand of Great Britain, with the success and the history, probably would give us that extra little bit.\"But there's nothing that can build the respect for the international game like this.\"'Anything could happen on the day'The key to building that respect will be a competitive series.\"Australia will start as favourites,\" Davies says. \"I think they have to because of the past history of the results. They have the intensity of the NRL competition. But it's the first one, they could be caught cold a little bit.\"I think anything could happen at Wembley on the day. That's the one that's going to set the tone for the rest of the series.\"The hope, for England, is that someone produces a moment to remember.Offiah adds: \"There are a lot of players who want to state their name on the international stage.\"I'd say to all Australian and English rugby league fans, it's definitely going to be a moment in history.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulPA MediaThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) is investigating claims Russian hackers stole hundreds of sensitive military documents and published them on the dark web. The Mail on Sunday first reported the files on the dark web -  an area of internet that can only be accessed through particular software - hold details of eight RAF and Royal Navy bases as well as MoD staff names and emails.Maintenance and construction contractor Dodd Group confirmed it suffered a ransomware incident and it was taking the claims \"extremely seriously\". The MoD said in a statement it was \"actively investigating the claims that information relating to the MoD has been published on the dark web\". \"To safeguard sensitive operational information, we will not comment any further on the details,\" it added in a statement. The Mail on Sunday reported the documents hold information about a number of sensitive RAF and Navy bases, including RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the US Air Force's F-35 jets are based.A Dodd Group spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that the Dodd Group recently experienced a ransomware incident whereby an unauthorised third-party gained temporary access to part of our internal systems.\"We took immediate steps to contain the incident, swiftly secure our systems and engaged a specialist IT forensic firm to investigate what happened.\"We are taking these claims extremely seriously and are working hard to validate this.\"The hacks follow a series of high-profile data breaches at the MoD. In August it was revealed thousands of Afghans brought to safety in the UK had their personal data exposed after an MoD sub-contractor suffered a data breach.Last year the personal information of an unknown number of serving UK military personnel was accessed in a significant data breach.

    "body": "3 hours agoGill DummiganNorth WestBBCFreya Mandapalli, 19, is among many medical students who are choosing to study abroad A growing number of young people are choosing to study in Eastern Europe due to a strict cap on medical school places in the UK.Freya Mandapalli from Preston is one of them.The 19-year-old has healthcare in her blood.  Her parents both work at the local hospital and her older sister studied medicine at Edinburgh and now works as a doctor.\"I just got inspired by her really,\" Freya said.But getting into a medical school in the UK generally requires a minimum of three As at A-level and high grades in other subjects and Freya struggled to get them.Although she got interviews, she didn't receive any offers.  She considered a gap year but then a family friend mentioned the possibility of studying in Plovdiv, in Southern Bulgaria.\"I was really nervous to start with, but the city's beautiful and I've found some great friends,\" added Freya, who has just started her second year of a medical degree.In England around 8,126 medical students started this academic year, just over a thousand of them in the North West.  This is sharply up from two years ago when it was just 7,010 but still far short of the 15,000 the government says it needs for England by 2031 to meet demand.But with the cap on medical school places, it means competition to get one is intense, and many students are voting with their feet.'Word of mouth'Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton has just started his fifth year at the same university in Plovdiv.  He too found the course through word of mouth.\"One of my friends told me that his brother already studies within Bulgaria and he was planning on going himself,\" he said.\"My mother was very worried, my father wanted me to stay strong and be independent, but the rest of my family didn't know what to expect.  But those worries gradually subsided.\"The Medical University of Plovdiv is one of Bulgaria's most prestigious medical schools and attracts many more applicants than it admits.  Although it does ask for academic qualifications, a large part of the admissions process hangs on an entrance exam.Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton is now in his fifth year at the university in PlovdivVeselina Goranova, vice rector for Education, says their students' home countries include Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Canada, the US – but added the biggest group by far, \"about 40% come from the UK\".That may be in part because classes for international students are held in English but also because a well-established network of agencies now exist to help those hoping to make the leap.Dr Muhammad Hamza from Blackburn graduated from Plovdiv last year and is currently back there helping to settle new students. He works with MedConnect Europe Ltd, an agency headquartered in London but with offices around Eastern Europe.He says the agency helps new students navigate the complications of a new life abroad like finding a flat, dealing with paperwork, and sorting out life's essentials.\"We get them in touch with the estate agents, we book the flights for them. Our representatives will be there at the airport to collect them, take them to the hotels,\" he said.Medical students, including Freya, are studying in Bulgaria instead of the UKStrict timetable\"We help them with shopping – buying bedding, cutlery..wifi, mobile sims, setting them up.  Because they don't know the language and we have representatives in each country which do know the language it becomes so much easier,\" he added.Dr Hamza spends most of his time working as a private dentist in Chorley, where he spends a year with a mentor. The firm, he says, came out to Plovdiv to recruit dentists there.\"It's probably because of the vast practical experience we get in Bulgaria,\" he said, adding that the Bulgarian system requires students to complete large numbers of relatively complex procedures.\"So going and starting as a dentist in the UK, I already had somewhat of a solid foundation.\"New students need to get used to a strict timetable which often begins at 7.30am and may not finish until 6pm.  They also need to study Bulgarian so they can talk to the patients they will be treating in the last three years of their course.Dr Hamza now works as a Dentist in Chorley after studying in BulgariaBulgarian, like Russian, uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and a complex grammar structure.  Milena Muleshkova is one of those tasked with getting the students up to scratch. She says that first year is about everyday communication, while the second-year concentrates on medical terms.Medical courses in Bulgaria last six years,  one year longer than in the UK but common in mainland Europe.  At the end of it, successful students have a degree which is recognised by the General Medical Council in England, and which allows them to practice in the NHS without any further tests.Watch BBC World Service documentary : Why are medical students going to Bulgaria?This may change though in 2028 when Britain next looks at its agreements with the EU.  And another potential change is particularly worrying some students.The NHS has become increasingly reliant on attracting healthcare staff from overseas to meet increasing patient demand. In 2023 68% of doctors joining the NHS were international medical graduates (IMGs) and the number has been rising year on year.There is uncertainty around the future of qualifications medical students gain from studying in BulgariaCurrently the NHS treats applicants from overseas and the UK in the same way for jobs and training opportunities.  This has become an increasingly contentious issue for resident (formerly known as junior) doctors in England who say many at the beginning of their career are being denied the opportunity to progress.Earlier this month they voted to strike over the shortage of speciality training places.But the doctors' union the British Medical Association wants UK graduates to be prioritised for those training posts.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting says he agrees.  But this could mean British students studying abroad would also be looked at less favourably because they would also be classed as IMGs.'It's quite scary'Mohammed Adnaan Patel said he did have sympathy with much of the argument but not all.He said: \"It's quite a topic of frequent discussion as the years go on as we get closer to that stage,\"\"It is quite scary.  It does raise a lot of anxiety within the students and myself.\"But the NHS also has difficulty keeping hold of medical staff.  Last year in the North West of England one in ten left  - although that was actually better than the year before.  Some will have left the profession altogether but some will have been tempted away by similar jobs in Canada, Australia, and the gulf states, who also run international recruitment campaigns.As the global population ages and healthcare needs increase, the international fight to attract trained medical staff, wherever they come from, is likely to intensify.Dr Muhammad Hamza from MedConnect Europe says he doesn't see the demand for European students slowing any time soon.He said: \"I see it growing because the demand for doctors and dentists, not only in the UK is a lot but all over the world\"\"I don't see it slowing down.  It's going to expand further and further.\"",

Food plays a central role in the celebrations.  Families prepare a variety of traditional Indian sweets which are shared with friends and neighbours. Festive meals often include rich curries, savoury snacks, and special breads. In the days leading up to the festival, people clean and decorate their homes, shop for new clothes, and buy traditional sweets to exchange as gifts with friends and family. Many also create traditional and colourful rangoli designs outside their doors to invite luck and positivity. On Diwali itself, families worship Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth.Diwali's appeal goes beyond religion, drawing people from different communities and faiths to join in the celebrations. Across India's cities and towns, markets bustle with shoppers buying sweets, gifts, decorations, and firecrackers, giving a significant boost to the economy each year.Debarchan Chatterjee/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesMarkets bustle with shoppers buying gifts and decorations, giving a significant boost to the economyGetty ImagesPeople decorate their homes with colourful paper lanterns to celebrate the festival Getty ImagesThe festival unites communities as people of all faiths join in festivitiesGetty ImagesA building in Mumbai city lit up with paper laterns hung outside houses",

    "body": "4 hours agoMartin YipHong Kong andStuart LauWatch: Wreckage of cargo plane seen at Hong Kong International AirportA cargo plane skidded off a runway at Hong Kong International Airport and landed in the sea early on Monday, killing two ground staff.Emirates flight EK9788 was arriving from Dubai at about 03:50 local time (19:50 GMT) when it veered off the runway and collided with an airport patrol vehicle.The two people inside the vehicle died, while the four crew members onboard the plane survived the crash.It marks one of Hong Kong's deadliest aviation incidents in years - the city's international airport has had a good safety record.Authorities have launched an investigation as questions remain over the path taken by the plane upon landing.Airport officials have said they gave the correct instructions to the plane and that there are signs on the runway to guide aircraft.Airport operations executive director Steven Yiu said the patrol car was, at the time, travelling on a road outside of the runway's fencing \"at a safe distance from the runway\". The plane then turned away from the runway, crashed through the fencing and collided with the vehicle, pushing it into the sea, Mr Yiu explained.\"Normally the plane is not supposed to turn towards the sea,\" he said at a news conference hours after the incident, adding that the plane did not send out a distress signal when it was landing.He stressed that the airport patrol car \"definitely did not run out onto the runway\".Divers managed to locate the bodies of the patrol vehicle’s driver and passenger in the sea.The two dead ground staff were aged 30 and 41 and had seven and 12 years' experience respectively, officials said. Hong Kong's transport bureau has said it was \"saddened\" by their deaths and expressed condolences to their families.In a statement to the BBC, an Emirates spokesperson said the plane \"sustained damage on landing in Hong Kong\", adding: \"Crew are confirmed to be safe and there was no cargo onboard.\"It also said the Boeing 747-481 cargo aircraft was wet leased from, and operated by, Turkish carrier Act Airlines. A wet lease is an arrangement where one airline provides the aircraft, crew, and insurance to another airline.The four crew members onboard the plane had opened the emergency doors of the aircraft shortly after the crash. They were spotted by fire service staff who arrived at the scene within two minutes, and were rescued, authorities said.Pictures show the plane had broken in half, with part of the fuselage submerged in the water with large cracks clearly visible. At least one emergency evacuation slide deployed successfully.ReutersPart of the plane's fuselage is lying in the water off the runwayA police official told the media that criminal investigations would not be ruled out.An official from the Hong Kong Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) said they were still trying to locate the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - also known as the black boxes - from the sea.The affected runway would remain closed for the rest of the day, but the airport's other two runways are still in operation.At least 11 cargo flights initially scheduled to arrive at Hong Kong International Airport on Monday have been cancelled, according to the Airport Authority's website.It marks the second ever deadly incident at the airport since it moved from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok in July 1998. In August 1999, a China Airlines passenger flight crash landed during a typhoon, killing three people.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAlex TaylorGetty ImagesSaying \"no\" to a boss can feel impossible.Whatever our job, we all want to impress rather than disappoint.But ambition can be a very slippery slope. Before you know it, work is coming home with you - seeping into weekends and disrupting time with family and friends.Experts agree learning to set boundaries is the way to stem the flow.Career coach Helen Tupper, co-founder of Squiggly Careers, suggests a simple language shift can help reinforce boundaries. She recommends replacing \"I can't\" with \"I don't\".\"I can't\" invites negotiation - people might try to convince you that you actually can,\" she says. But \"I don't\" is more definitive and harder to challenge.For example you can say \"I don't go to meetings after 5pm on a Wednesday because I pick my kids up then,\" she suggests.Model and TV chef Lorraine Pascale says not doing this ultimately led to her burning out.Alongside her television career, she opened a patisserie in Covent Garden and published a series of cookbooks, all whilst raising her daughter.\"I just wasn't very good at saying no.\"You don't want to upset people, everyone's feeding stuff in your ear as to what you should be doing. So you just keep going,\" she told The Woman's Hour Guide to Life.She adds that her perfectionism, including personally approving every recipe in her books, didn't help.For Lorraine, burnout manifested physically and mentally - including \"not wanting to go near\" cakes.\"It was like an all-body reaction - a tightness in my chest,\" she explains. \"I was having arguments with myself. A lot of self-blame, a lot of guilt, and a lot of tiredness.\"Lorraine, who found success as a model and TV chef before she experienced burnout, pictured in the Woman's Hour studioLorraine's experience shows burnout can affect anyone at any level, even if statistics suggest it is more likely to happen to women - in part because of added family responsibilities.Dr Claire Ashley, author of The Burnout Doctor, says on a practical front, sticking to a firm routine over when you finish work each day allows our brains to complete the \"stress cycle\" and enjoy time off.But the real solution is adjusting your goals to your \"current capacity\".\"Ask yourself whether what you want to achieve is reasonable given your mental and emotional resources at the time,\" she says.In Lorraine's case this involved stepping back from cooking and going to therapy. This helped her understand that the toxic elements of her drive to impress stemmed from her childhood in foster care.She's since begun studying psychology herself and says she is \"much better\" - gradually getting back into cooking on more \"intentional\" terms.Of course, stress and long hours are part of any job.But stats show an increase in the number of workers reaching breaking point.Nine out of 10 workers have experienced high or extreme levels of pressure or stress in the past year, research suggests.Feeling stressed or burnt out isn't the same as having clinical burnout - even if we often use the term loosely.Dr Ashley says exhaustion, detachment, and reduced performance are the three defining symptoms.Unless we meet all these, we don't yet have diagnosable burnout. But of course this doesn't mean we're not on the way.'Run your own race'Tupper, who wrote her book after experiencing burnout herself, says it's important to stop, celebrate and acknowledge your own successes, not just focus on the next thing.Doing our best to avoid comparisons with colleagues can also help, so we run our own race, Tupper adds.Of course, not everyone is in a position to push back at work - especially in corporate, or hierarchical job environments.Dr Richard Duggins, an NHS psychiatrist and the author of Burnout-Free Working, often helps patients who feel they can't assert boundaries.He encourages workers to talk to their boss regardless of how junior they are.\"Most employers, even the hard-nosed ones, will listen and make adjustments when they understand that preventing burnout benefits everyone.\"He says setting boundaries, asking for help, or adjusting workload or flexibility can all help, but in the end if the workplace environment doesn't change then we need to make changes to protect ourselves.Appreciating our life stages can be help with this, notes Dr Ashley.\"It's okay to say that someone working part-time, or with family responsibilities, may not be able to match the workload of a younger colleague.\"As Lorraine puts it: \"Ambitious is fine. Being ambitious is a beautiful thing, but just learn to say no more often.\"Other stories you may enjoySign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoGabriela PomeroyReutersSecurity measures \"failed\" in preventing a major jewellery heist in the Louvre museum in Paris on Sunday, creating a very negative image of the country, the French justice minister has said.\"People were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels and give France a terrible image,\" Gérald Darmanin said.Thieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most-visited museum in broad daylight, stealing eight items described as being of inestimable value, before escaping on scooters. There are fears that unless the thieves are caught quickly, the priceless items - including a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife - will be broken up and smuggled out of the country.Darmanin told France Inter radio he was certain police would eventually arrest the thieves.But the head of an organisation specialising in the location and recovery of stolen and looted artworks warned that if the thieves are not caught in the next 24 to 48 hours, the stolen jewellery will likely be \"long gone\".\"There is a race going on right now,\" Chris Marinello, the chief executive of Art Recovery International, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme. Crowns and diadems - which were stolen in the heist - can easily be broken apart and sold in small parts. The thieves \"are not going to keep them intact, they are going to break them up, melt down the valuable metal, recut the valuable stones and hide evidence of their crime,\" Mr Marinello said, adding it would be difficult to sell these jewels intact.The French police \"know that in the next 24 or 48 hours, if these thieves are not caught, those pieces are probably long gone,\" he said.\"They may catch the criminals but they won't recover the jewels.\"Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe theft took place between 09:30 and 09:40 local time on Sunday morning, shortly after the museum opened to visitors.Four masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.EPA/ShutterstockThe thieves approached the building from the River Seine banksideTwo of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the building.The thieves smashed the glass display cases and stole the jewels, which collectively contained thousands of diamonds and precious gemstones.The robbery took just seven minutes.As the museum's alarms started blaring, staff followed protocol by contacting security forces, the culture ministry said in a statement.The thieves had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member, it added.Eight items of jewellery were stolen in total, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife, Empress Marie Louise.Also taken was a diadem (jewelled headband) that once belonged to the Empress Eugénie - wife of Napoleon III - which has nearly 2,000 diamonds.They also took a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France, and which contains eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, according to the Louvre's website.Louvre crowds evacuate after museum robbery",

    "body": "8 hours agoSeveral papers lead with the Metropolitan Police's investigation into media reports that Prince Andrew allegedly used his police protection to try to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre. It allegedly occurred just before the Mail published a photo of the pair's first meeting in February 2011, in what the Sun describes as an order to \"dig dirt\". Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. On Friday, he announced he would give up his royal titles, including the Duke of York.The Daily Mail leads with details on King Charles III's \"threat\" to strip Prince Andrew of his royal titles. The paper cites anonymous sources who say the prince tried to \"dig his heels in\", despite \"the growing tsunami of evidence\" about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It prompted the King to threaten \"further action\" unless his brother \"saw sense\", the paper reports.The Daily Mirror also leads on the claims that Andrew tried to \"dig up dirt\" on Giuffre, declaring it the \"scandal with no end\". The paper also contains details about the King's intervention, quoting a source who said: \"The scandal has engulfed the family for too long, forcing the King to banish him.\"Calls for Prince Andrew to lose his title lead the Metro, including \"by the family of Virginia Giuffre\". The paper's headline, \"And when he was down, he was down\", alludes to the nursery rhyme \"The Grand Old Duke of York\".The Times also leads with the Metropolitan Police investigation into Prince Andrew's \"bid for police to investigate his accuser\". The newspaper also reports that \"Russian spies and hard-left humanitarian groups are working with people smugglers to flood Europe with illegal migrants\", citing remarks from Bulgaria's interior minister. The i Paper leads with reports on the tensions in Gaza, saying the ceasefire is \"in peril\". It reports the \"fragile sense of calm\" was disrupted by a \"wave of air strikes\" by Israel's military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"claims it bombed \"terror targets\" in response to an alleged attack on Israeli soldiers in Rafah\", in southern Gaza, the paper says. The IDF and Hamas \"blame each other for breaching ceasefires\", according to the paper.\"Scramble to shore up ceasefire as Israel hits Gaza with deadly raids\", reads the headline on the front page of the Guardian. Two IDF soldiers were killed in a Hamas attack and dozens of Palestinians were killed in \"retaliatory strikes\", the paper reports. The heist at the Louvre in Paris also features on the front page. It reports on the French police's investigation into the brazen seven-minute theft at the museum, which closed on Sunday. The paper says one of the pieces of jewellery stolen was a necklace Napoleon had given to his wife.A \"fractious\" White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky leads the Financial Times. The paper reports the meeting between the two leaders \"descended many times into a \"shouting match\", citing \"people familiar with the matter\". The paper says Trump urged Zelensky to \"surrender the entire Donbas region\" to Russia.The Daily Telegraph also leads with the Trump-Zelensky White House meeting. It says Trump had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly before hosting Zelensky. It describes \"shouting and swearing\" during the Trump-Zelensky meeting, adding: \"Mr Trump threw aside Ukrainian maps of the battlefield.\"The Daily Express leads with an exclusive story, reporting the mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan \"read reports of young girls being raped in hotels by groups of men while publicly denying there were any grooming gangs in the capital\". It quotes whistleblower Maggie Oliver, who told the paper  \"the cases followed 'the same pattern' she had seen with Greater Manchester Police's cover-up of the Rochdale scandal\", where a group of seven men were found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over five years. \"The mayor and the Metropolitan Police have consistently claimed to have 'no reports' of Rochdale or Rotherham-style rape gangs in the capital\", the paper reports.The Daily Star leads with the British Film Institute (BFI) adding the \"lettuce livestream\" to its national archive, marking three years since Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. The livestream featured a \"plucky 60p Tesco iceberg\", which was \"livestreamed to see if it would outlast Truss's time in No 10 in 2022\". Several papers lead on the Metropolitan Police looking into claims Prince Andrew allegedly used his police protection to try to obtain personal information about Virginia Giuffre. \"Andy sweats over police probe\" is the Sun's headline. The Daily Telegraph says Prince Andrew faces becoming the first member of the Royal Family to be investigated by police in more than 20 years. The Daily Mirror calls it the \"scandal with no end\". Prince Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing.The front page of the Guardian says parliament is under mounting pressure to introduce a mechanism to formally strip Prince Andrew of his titles, given the ongoing revelations. The i Paper reports the government will be \"guided\" by the Royal Family when it comes to forming a decision.Some of the papers offer suggestions on what the Royal Family should do next. The Daily Mail says the King should \"cut the cord\" and have Prince Andrew \"evicted\". The Daily Mirror says he should go into voluntary exile. The Daily Star has a similar proposal: that he should be \"banished\" from public life or sent to the Tower of London.The Financial Times reports Friday's meeting between Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House descended into a \"shouting match\". The FT's sources claim the US president repeated arguments used by Russia and was \"cursing all the time\".According to the Times, Reform UK is investigating whether it underpaid value-added tax (VAT) after experts said the party might have broken the law and could face a fine. Political parties are required to pay VAT on certain types of income over the value of £90,000 a year. The Times' sources believe the threshold was exceeded due to ticket sales from Reform's party conference.The Daily Star is celebrating after its video of the lettuce which outlasted Liz Truss's time as prime minister in 2022 joined the British Film Institute's National Archive. The BFI called the livestream a \"seminal moment in British political history\" that should be \"preserved for future generations\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "1 hour agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter andGeorge WrightVirginia Giuffre says she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir reveals. The BBC has obtained a full copy of Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein, ahead of its publication on Tuesday - almost six months after she took her own life.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre also says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has always denied any wrongdoing.The memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.Much of the book makes for extremely harrowing reading, as Ms Giuffre details the sadistic abuse that Epstein put her through.She says Epstein subjected her to sadomasochistic sex which caused her \"so much pain that I prayed I would black out\".A Buckingham Palace source told BBC News they accept there could be \"more days of pain ahead\" as a result of the publication of the book, which puts Prince Andrew under further scrutiny. The King's engagements this week include a visit to the Vatican, where he will pray alongside the Pope.On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.He is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.In his statement, he said: \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"While Andrew, who remains a prince as son of a monarch, will no longer be using his titles, a small number of MPs are calling for them to be officially removed from him. They include Rachael Maskell, Independent MP for York Central, and Stephen Flynn, SNP leader at Westminster. But Henry Zeffman, BBC chief political correspondent, said: \"I think the government is extremely unlikely to take the lead on this. \"It may well be that developments require further action against Andrew but if they do, I think it would be the monarchy making that judgment call and the government following suit, rather than the other way around.\"The new book, written by Ms Giuffre and ghostwriter Amy Wallace, puts the prince under even more scrutiny.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" and that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".She says that when she met Prince Andrew later that day, Maxwell told him to guess her age.The prince, who was then 41, \"guessed correctly: seventeen\", Ms Giuffre said. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying.That night, she says she attended London's Tramp nightclub with Prince Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where she says the prince \"sweated profusely\".In a car on the way back to Maxwell's house afterwards, Ms Giuffre writes that Maxwell told her: \"When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.\"She wrote that back at the house they had sex.\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she says.\"The next morning, it was clear that Maxwell had conferred with her royal chum because she told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.'\"Ms Giuffre writes that she \"didn't feel so great\", adding: \"Soon, Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy' -  a lot of money.\"Ms Giuffre says she had sex for a second time with the prince around a month later at Epstein's townhouse in New York.She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".She writes that she said in a sworn declaration in 2015 that she was \"around 18\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says. \"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. \"Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"Later in the book, Ms Giuffre touches on her 2022 out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew after she brought a civil case against him.\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" she writes.While Ms Giuffre's alleged interactions with Prince Andrew have been widely reported by the British press, the book's content is wider in scope - littered with sinister details of Epstein's sex trafficking.The girls were required to look \"childlike\", Ms Giuffre says, and her childhood eating disorder was \"only encouraged\" under Epstein's roof.\"In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people,\" she writes.\"I was habitually used and humiliated - and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied.\"I believed that I might die a sex slave.\"Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.On Sunday, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection officer (PPO).According to the Mail on Sunday, the prince asked the officer to investigate Ms Giuffre just before the newspaper published a photo in February 2011 of her first meeting with the prince.The newspaper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.Dai Davies, the former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, told BBC One's Breakfast the issue was \"scandalous\" adding: \"It needs to be put to bed one way or another.\"\"If - and I say if - there's any evidence of criminality either under the data protection act or malfeasance in public office, then that has to be carefully considered, and then a report sent to the Crown Prosecution [Service],\" he said.\"And clearly the government themselves then would have to act, in terms of his status still as a prince.\"A royal source told the BBC there are currently no plans for the removal of the prince title that Andrew was born with.\"The headlines are taking a lot of oxygen out of the royal room,\" they added, referring to press about Prince Andrew diverting attention away from King Charles's engagements.In 2019, the prince repeatedly told BBC Newsnight that he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\" and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"Buckingham Palace has not commented.Virginia Giuffre's brother calls on King to strip prince Andrew of 'prince' title",

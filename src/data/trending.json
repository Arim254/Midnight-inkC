    "body": "Reinventing Football - five things fans would changeImage source, Getty ImagesAfter asking players, pundits and referees what changes they would make to reinvent football, we opened the debate up to you.We opened the floor for fans to imagine a world in which they could rip up the rulebook and start again. The topic stirred up plenty of debate across our live page and social media and we received thousands of messages from our audience, suggesting the one thing they would change.Here are the top five talking points, followed by the assessment of former Premier League referee Chris Foy and BBC Sport's football issues correspondent Dale Johnson.Ditch marginal offsides - make it clear and obviousImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, An injury suffered by Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi in May raised questions about the future of the offside lawThe offside rule was a widely-debated topic, with fans wanting to either tweak the law, or get rid of it completely. Former Premier League referee Anthony Taylor said \"scrapping offside might be the answer\" and added: \"One of the best tournaments I refereed in was a prison officer tournament and we had no offside... and we had so many goals it was unbelievable.\"Another frustration for supporters is around 'delaying the flag' - where officials are told to keep their flag down if they felt there was an immediate goalscoring opportunity.What the fans said:Matt: Scrap the offside flag going up 20 minutes after someone is offside. Needlessly wasting time and play continuing could result in injuries. Just throw the flag up when they're off.Sal: I would change the offside rule, where there has to be \"daylight\" between the last defender and attacker, in order for a claim of offside to be legitimate.Charlie: I would remove offside completely. Hockey successfully removed offside many years ago and I think it would see more goals which is what fans want to see.Chris: I would like the offside law changed, so you can only be offside beyond the 18-yard line. This would spread out the play.What Chris Foy said: \"Assistant refereeing is an art form and they are encouraged to keep the flag down in clear attacking situations. But I do understand that sometimes it can be frustrating.\"With semi-automated technology, I believe we have an accurate judgement of offside.\"What Dale Johnson said: \"'Daylight offside' has been a topic of discussion ever since it was suggested by Arsene Wenger in 2020.\"It has not made it to full trials because there are serious doubts about its impact on the tactical approach to a game. Giving more advantage to the attacker doesn't necessarily mean more goals, it could lead to more defensive play. I'd be very surprised if this ever happens.\"Stop the clock and reduce time-wastingMedia caption, What if pundits could change one thing about football...Goalkeepers holding the ball for more than eight seconds are now punished with a corner for the opposition, but what about time-wasting elsewhere on the pitch? The average ball-in-play time this season 55 minutes 05 seconds - 114 seconds down from last season.What the fans said:Anthony: When infringements or injuries occur, stop the clock as they do in rugby. Then at the 90th minute, that is the end of the match. No more debates about why several minutes have been added to half-time or full-time.Gary: Change the game to 60 minutes, but with a stop clock when the ball isn't in play [like basketball]. In most current games, there is less than 50 minutes of play. Would eliminate time-wasting in an instant.Tony: The clock stops every time ball goes out of play, and the referee blows his whistle to stop play.Alex: Follow rugby, stop the clock for any injury, video assistant referee (VAR) check, etc. If you are losing, you want more injury time; if you are winning, you want less. So just stop the clock, get rid of the unknown at the end of the game.What Chris Foy said: \"Time is always a big talking point in football. Something could be adopted to address this, for example, an independent timekeeper as we have in other sports such as basketball.\"The referee calls time off and on when play restarts. The fans can then also see the clock counting down which I'm sure will add to the excitement.\"What Dale Johnson said: \"One issue with a stopped clock is that unless you're in a ground with a scoreboard, the fans would have no idea how long there is left to play.\"But more and more time is being lost to stoppages like goal-kicks, throw-ins and corner-kicks. All three are at their highest this season. So something has to be done about it.\"'Ban the cheats' - punish dissent and simulationImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only captains are supposed to approach referees during Premier League matches this seasonUnder current rules referees can instruct players not to approach them, and show yellow cards to those who do so without permission and behave in a disrespectful manner. Diving should also result in a booking. However, many fans believe this is not enforced enough.Former Liverpool and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy said \"for anyone caught cheating or diving, the other team gets a penalty\", while ex-Blackburn and Celtic forward Chris Sutton said: \"Rather than just a yellow card for simulation, I would upgrade that to a red card and a three-game ban. Let's ban the cheats.\"What the fans said:Christopher: Swearing at the ref or any abusive language = immediate red card and a four-match ban.Jeff: Any attempt to simulate a foul would be an instant yellow card, but given when a break in play, and monitored by VAR. Any holding or pulling of clothing to be a yellow card, again monitored by VAR. Both of these are against the spirit of the game.Dave: Implement cards for any kind of simulation. Too many players conning the ref trying to get advantage, in particular players going down holding face or head when never touched. Classic example was Gabriel holding his face for Sunderland's second goal when clearly nowhere near his face.David: Red card for simulation, how long have fans been asking for this?What Chris Foy said: \"Dissent is a problem at many levels of football and when I was refereeing it was no different. If open acts of dissent are detected they should be dealt with - 2019 saw the introduction of sin-bins at grassroots football which is a great addition for dealing with open shows of dissent. Referees cannot do it alone and everyone has a duty to protect the image of the game.\"Change handball ruleImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal defender Gabriel handles the ball against NewcastleReferees now have a whole menu of reasons to give handball, with the aim to give a \"clearer and more consistent definition and interpretation\". What it brought was consistently more penalties, because there were many more reasons to give one.Former England captain Alan Shearer said some of the phraseology was confusing and has called for change: \"Proximity... obvious position... not in an obvious position... natural,\" he said. \"For me, it's pretty simple - is it deliberate handball or not?\". It's safe to say fans agree with him.What fans said:Mike: Bring back the old, sensible \"ball to hand\" as accidental handball. Common sense interpretation needed. Some of these handball calls are utterly ridiculous and ruin a game.Harry: Hand to ball is a penalty, ball to hand is not a penalty. That would stop players from aiming for hands in the penalty area.David: Handball in the box by a defender should be an indirect free-kick. The ball accidentally hitting a hand does not warrant a penalty, which can change a game completely.Simon: Scrap penalties for handballs in the box unless it's denying a goalscoring opportunity. Indirect free-kick instead. Giving the attacking team an almost guaranteed goal for something can be a really minor infraction by the defender is wildly disproportionate.What Chris Foy said: \"To prove if something was absolutely deliberate, you would have to ask a player if they meant to handle the ball.\"Personally, I think the game is in a good place regarding the handball rule and don't forget we have had a number of changes over the past five years. We don't want to see changes every year.\"Bring in a challenge system on VARImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Premier League fans have protested against VAR since its introduction in 2019-20Former England striker Ellen White said VAR \"takes out the joy and the emotion when a goal is scored\" for players and fans alike, while ex-Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock said it has \"too many inconsistencies and it's down to human error, which is still a massive problem\".Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan doesn't think we should get rid of VAR, but \"there should be a 90-second rule. If it is not clear an obvious in 90 seconds, it's not clear and obvious.\"What fans said:Owen: With VAR, learn from cricket and only go to VAR on request from the captain... Three requests per game for each team. It would mean fewer VAR calls and would only be when there were really clear errors not just minor ones.Barry: I would change VAR to only be activated if the referee asks for a check, similar to rugby.Jeff: If something takes more than a minute, it's not clear and obvious. Refs have a big enough on-field team, VAR is an unnecessary addition, and I would love to know the cost to clubs, and why they don't bin it?Mike: Get rid of VAR completely. We had 120-odd years of the old system when football was football. Now, it's a waste of time.Charlie: Why aren't refs allowed to request to see the monitor themselves? Stop VAR telling the ref what to do and let the ref use VAR himself. If the ref isn't sure he should ask VAR to bring it up on the monitor instead of waiting five minutes.What Chris Foy said: \"In relation to VAR and its protocol, the referee can initiate a 'review' for a potential 'clear and obvious error' or 'serious missed incident' when the VAR (or another match official) recommends a 'review' and the referee suspects something serious has been missed.\"Time limit on checks are difficult to implement as in some situations, checks have many moving pieces.\"Dale Johnson added: \"The problem with placing a time limit on reviews is the necessary proof may not be immediately available.\"Last season, in a VAR review for a penalty Liverpool had been awarded against Wolves, the VAR appeared ready to support the decision after the first few replay angles. But then the next replay clearly showed the attacker had initiated contact.\"With a time limit, this may have stayed as a penalty. There's no doubt that if you do place a time limit, incorrect decisions may not be overturned.\"",

    "body": "Dominican Republic suffers nationwide power cut after 'cascade of failures'2 hours agoBen HattonAFP via Getty ImagesThe country was recently battered by Hurricane Melissa (file photo)The Dominican Republic has experienced a nationwide power cut which officials said was linked to a failure in the electricity transmission system. At 13:23 local time (17:23 GMT) an issue at a substation caused a nationwide interruption to power services, the state-owned Dominican Electricity Transmission Company said, citing the country's energy minister Joel Santos Echeverría.Echeverría said a thorough investigation would be carried out to identify the cause and that work was under way to quickly restore power. The Caribbean nation, which is home to around 11 million people, has been experiencing smaller blackouts in recent weeks, the AFP news agency reports. Officials at the state-owned power company said generation units in two major power plants had shut down, causing \"a cascade of failures\" in other parts of the grid.Local media reported the metro and cable car in the capital, Santo Domingo, had stopped working and people had to be evacuated during the national blackout on Tuesday. There have also been reports of chaotic scenes on the country's roads. Social media users reported power outages in various parts of the country, but electricity and internet were operational in some places, reports say.Last month, Hurricane Melissa was blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, after the category five storm blasted through the region.The Caribbean nation is a major tourist destination. Once ruled by Spain, the Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, a former French colony.",

The Einstein-Freud LettersAvailable for over a yearIn 1932 the world-famous physicist Albert Einstein wrote a public letter to the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Einstein, a keen advocate of the League of Nations and peace campaigner, asked Freud if he thought war and aggression was forever tied to human psychology and the course of international relations: could we ever secure a lasting world peace? \nEinstein’s letter is deeply prescient, as is Freud’s extraordinary response. The exchange was titled ‘Why War?’. The two thinkers explore the nature of war and peace in politics and in all human life; they think about human nature, the history of warfare and human aggression and the hope represented by the foundation of the League of Nations (precursor to the UN) and its promise of global security and a new architecture of international law. \nAt the time of their exchange, Freud is in the last great phase of his career and has already introduced psychoanalysis into the field of politics and society. Einstein, the younger of the two, is using his huge international profile as a physicist for political and pacifist intervention.\nFor Einstein, future world security means a shared moral understanding across the global order - that humankind rise above the ‘state of nature’ never to devolve into total war again. He wrote to Freud, as 'a citizen of the world…immune to nationalist bias...I greatly admire your passion to ascertain the truth. You have shown how the aggressive and destructive instincts are bound up in the human psyche with those of love and the lust for life. At the same time, you make manifest your devotion to the goal of liberation from the evils of war...’ Is it possible, Einstein asks Freud, to make us 'proof against the psychoses of hate and destructiveness?'. Freud's answer is fascinating and quite unexpected.  \nThe exchange of letters was sponsored by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, an organisation promoting global security by using prominent thinkers, drawing on multiple fields of knowledge (from science to psychology, politics and law) to achieve a new language for international peace, following the lessons learned from the Great War of 1914-18. \nBut even as Einstein wrote to Freud in the summer of 1932, the Nazi party became the largest political party in the German Reichstag. Both men felt a sense of apprehension about what was coming; both were pacifist, both Jewish, both would be driven into exile (both Einsteinian physics and Freudian psychoanalysis were denounced by the new regime). The letters were finally published in 1933 when Hitler came to power, suppressed in Germany, and as a result never achieved the circulation intended for them. \nFeaturing readings from the Einstein–Freud letters and contributions from historians of warfare and psychoanalysis, war journalism and global security, this feature showcases the little-known exchange between two of the 20th century’s greatest thinkers, ‘Why War?’ – a question just as relevant in today’s world.\nContributors include historian of war and peace Margaret MacMillan, BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, defence and security expert Mark Galeotti, historian of international relations Patrick O Cohrs, author Lisa Appignanesi, who has written on Freud and the history of psychoanalysis, and Faisal Devji, historian of conflict and political violence in India and the Middle East. \nReadings are by Elliot Levey (Einstein) and Henry Goodman (Freud) \nProduced by Simon Hollis\nA Brook Lapping production for BBC Radio 4Programme Website",

    "body": "8 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is closing down some of his last remaining known business interests, including Pitch@Palace Global Ltd.Pitch@Palace was a Dragon's Den-style start-up competition where entrepreneurs could present their ideas to potential investors, and was once seen as a possible source of income for the former prince, after the King stopped supporting him financially.A document announcing the application to dissolve the company was filed with Companies House on Tuesday, signed by the company's only director Arthur Lancaster.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Mr Lancaster have been approached for comment.The decision to close Pitch@Palace marks another phase in the former prince's retreat from public life, after intense scrutiny over his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The pitching competition suspended operations in 2019, following an interview Mr Mountbatten-Windsor gave to BBC Newsnight, which led to him stepping down as a working royal and the removal of his royal titles.The UK side of the business was wound up in 2021, but the international part, Pitch@Palace Global, remained open. It became a further source of controversy when the founder of the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, Yang Tengbo, was accused of being a spy - which he denied.A Dutch company, Startup Bootcamp, previously said it was interested in buying the business, issuing a press release saying it saw \"immense value\" in the former Pitch@Palace network. However, the deal unravelled earlier this year.Most of the cash left on Pitch@Palace Global's balance sheet has been withdrawn in recent years. The latest set of accounts showed that it had just £10,965 left at the end of March, down from £220,990 the year before.Mr Lancaster is understood to hold the shares in Pitch@Palace Global on Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's behalf. The latter is listed as a person with significant control under his former title, Prince Andrew.Another company with links to the former Prince, Innovate Global Ltd, also began the process of closing down on Tuesday.Arthur Lancaster is the sole director of this company, too, and he signed the application to strike the company off, according to documents filed at Companies House on Tuesday.A plan to relaunch some of the international activities of Pitch@Palace under the brand Innovate Global was mentioned in a 2023 witness statement given by Mr Yang.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's name does not appear on the paperwork for Innovate Global Ltd. It has no employees and virtually no assets.It was announced on Tuesday that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's surname should be spelled with a hyphen.Versions with and without the hyphen have been used in the past, but a 1960 Privy Council announcement used the hyphenated version, which will be used from now on.",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again9 hours agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "36 minutes agoGeorgina RannardClimate reporter, Belém, BrazilProtesters broke through security lines and entered the venue of the COP30 UN climate talks on Tuesday night in Belém, Brazil.BBC journalists saw UN security staff running behind a line of Brazilian soldiers shouting at delegates to immediately leave the venue.Videos posted online showed people storming the COP30 entrance shouting and carrying placards reading \"our forests are not for sale\".The Brazilian government told the BBC that the protesters appeared to be from indigenous and political groups. Protesters crossed the first security barriers of the venue and were then prevented from getting further in, the UN told the BBC. Videos on social media showed tussling between protesters, some wearing what appeared to be traditional indigenous dress, and security guards. It is highly unusual breach of security in a conference that usually has strict protocols.A security guard told the Reuters news agency he was hit in the head by a drum thrown by a protester. The COP30 talks are hosting delegates from almost 200 countries, including senior politicians from across the world.They are being held in Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, which is home to dozens of indigenous groups.Many are vocal critics of the environmental damage caused by climate change and deforestation.An indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community told Reuters, \"we can't eat money,\" and that they were upset about development in the rainforest.\"We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers,\" he said.The meetings have been dubbed \"the Indigenous peoples COP\" as the Brazilian organisers have promised to put them front and centre of the talks.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the opening of the summit that the world must \"defeat\" climate denialism and fight fake news.President Lula said \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"fake news and misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".At the opening ceremony, members of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesA decision to reject compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age will be reconsidered by the government.Campaigners say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men. Last year, the government apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but rejected any kind of financial payouts.A document was not shown to Liz Kendall, who was Work and Pensions Secretary at the time of the decision, but had since come to light and needed to be considered, the government has now said.There is no guarantee any payout will be made, but campaigners said the move was a major step forward. Current Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told the Commons that retaking the decision would not automatically lead to compensation.\"Retaking this decision should not be taken as an indication that government will necessarily decide that it should award financial redress,\" he said.The undisclosed evidence involved was a survey from 2007, and McFadden said that checks would be made to ensure other documents and surveys had not been missed. No timescale has been given for the work to be done.\"I understand that people are impatient for this matter to be resolved,\" he said.\"It is important that we give it full and appropriate consideration.\"Angela Madden, who chairs Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi), said: \"The government now knows it got it wrong and we are pleased they are now trying to do it properly.\"We hope they also try to do it quickly.\"She added that the \"only correct thing to do\" was to compensate those affected immediately.Compensation recommendedEarly last year, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 for each of those affected.While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it and the government rejected it.Ministers said there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe that paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to £10.5bn would be \"fair or proportionate\" to taxpayers.The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least £10,000 each.It is pursuing a judicial review of the government's decision not to pay compensation. Campaigners raised money for the legal challenge and a court capped the contribution to the government's legal fees if they were unsuccessful.The case was scheduled to go to the High Court in December. The government has now informed the court of its latest decision.The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.The increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",

    "body": "The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have ordered female patients, caretakers and staff to wear a burka – a full Islamic veil - to enter public health facilities in the western city of Herat, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) says.MSF said the restrictions came into effect from 5 November.\"These restrictions further impede women's lives and limit women's access to health care,\" Sarah Chateau, the agency's programme manager in Afghanistan, told the BBC. She said even those \"in need of urgent medical care\" had been affected.A spokesman for the Taliban government has denied MSF's account. Reports say restrictions have been partially relaxed since the alarm was raised.MSF, which supports paediatric services at Herat Regional Hospital, said it had observed a 28% drop in admissions of patients whose conditions were urgent during the first few days of the new enforcement.Ms Chateau said Taliban members had been denying entry to women without the burka by standing at the entrance of the health facilities. A burka is a one-piece veil that covers the face and body, often leaving just a mesh screen to see through.A Taliban spokesperson for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry, which enforces strict religious doctrines, dismissed reports that women were being forced to wear the burka.\"This is totally false. The position of the vice and virtue ministry is generally on the wearing of hijab,\" Saif-ul-Islam Khyber said.Hijab means covering up generally but also describes the headscarves worn by Muslim women.  The Taliban official also rejected reports that women were banned from medical centres for not wearing the burka.At the same time, the Taliban official said: \"Hijab is interpreted differently in different parts of the country, most of which are in conflict with Sharia [law].\"Activists have also alleged that Taliban guards have been enforcing the wearing of burkas for women to enter key facilities for the past week.One female activist from Herat province told the BBC that the dress code was applicable for those who want to enter hospitals, schools and government offices.There has also been criticism on social media over the Taliban's reported decision to impose the burka in Herat.An Afghan activist posted a video on X showing some women setting fire to the garments in protest at the Taliban's rule. The BBC has not independently verified the video.The Taliban enforced the burka during their first stint in power in the 1990s.Since seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions, particularly for women, in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.In 2022, the Taliban issued a decree ordering women to wear an all-covering Islamic face veil in public.  Taliban officials then described the face veil edict as \"advice\".\"Even though the veil edit was announced earlier, this is the first time we are seeing the enforcement of the burka in Herat. In the past few days more and more women are coming to the hospital with burkas,\" Ms Chateau said.Since returning to power, the Taliban have barred women from most workplaces and universities and girls from secondary schools. The UN has repeatedly urged the Taliban to end what it describes as \"gender apartheid\".Last week, the UN said it had suspended operations at a key border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran because of restrictions on Afghan women staff working at the border.Islam Qala, in Herat province, has been the main crossing point for hundreds of thousands of Afghans forced to leave Iran in the past year.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats are calling for a 5% cut in VAT in  this month's budget to support the UK's ailing hospitality sector and their hard-pressed customers.Deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper has called on the Chancellor to cut VAT from 20% to 15% to boost footfall in Britain's pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues.She said the government should step in to help people obtain \"small joys\", such as a meal in a restaurant.This could be funded by a new windfall tax on big banks, originally proposed by the IPPR think tank, which Cooper claimed could raise around £30bn in total between now and 2030. More than half of people think going out to a pub or restaurant was now unaffordable for, according to recent polling from More in Common.Cooper said: \"People are working with their nose to the grindstone all month and have next to nothing left over after sky-high bills and spiralling food prices.\"In years gone by people knew they could look forward to fish and chips with their family on a Friday night or a weekend trip to the cinema. \"Now those small joys – the ones that make life worth living – are becoming an unaffordable luxury for too many.\"Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to break Labour's manifesto commitment not to increase income tax, VAT or National Insurance in her Budget later this month, and has suggested she will ditch the two child benefit cap.She is not expected to cut VAT. The Treasury has been contacted for a response to the Lib Dem policy proposal.The Lib Dems are also calling on the chancellor to cut energy bills by about £90 a year through axing the main renewables levy, which she claimed would bring energy bills down to the second lowest level since the energy crisis began in 2022.The Liberal Democrats say their two-pronged approach could be put in place immediately for the next 18 months and would save the average family £270 a month between now and April 2027.The package would cost £12bn, the party said, with the VAT cut costing £7.5bn and replacing the current renewables obligation levy £4.5bn. The windfall tax on big banks is estimated to bring in about £7bn a year to the Treasury.Cooper also called for the big bank levy to fund £2bn of capital investment for a new Energy Security Bank, which would include funding for green energy home loans.The Lib Dem sources said their Energy Security Bank would need two years to set up, taking its launch to the 2027-28 financial year, and use some of the remaining £18bn raised by the levy between April 2027 and April 2030.Reducing energy bills is a key focus of all the main parties, and the Liberal Democrats have now joined the Conservatives in calling for an end to the renewables obligation.The Green Party, like Labour, is firmly focused on ending the use of oil and gas, but Reform UK wants to scrap clean energy targets altogether, tax renewable energy, and go back to using fossil fuels and fracking.Labour is focused on expanding renewables to meet its manifesto pledge to cut energy bills by \"up to £300 by 2030\" and end the UK's reliance on fossil fuels, especially from countries like Russia.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

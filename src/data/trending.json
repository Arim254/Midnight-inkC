    "body": "6 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical CorrespondentA high-profile Hong Kong pro-democracy activist living in the UK has been the target of a campaign of harassment involving letters containing fake, sexually explicit images of her sent from China to her neighbours.Carmen Lau, 30, who fled Hong Kong four years ago, told the BBC she was \"shocked\" as the letters, delivered to addresses in Maidenhead, included her name and images made to look like she was either naked or in underwear and offering sexual services.\"The letters had a couple of very unpleasant images, AI-generated or photo-shopped, where they put my face on those images, portraying me as a sex-worker,\" she said.The existence of the letters was first reported by the Guardian.The first she knew about the letters was when the local MP, Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds, called her to say he had been alerted by some of his constituents who had received them.Ms Lau had sought sanctuary in the UK in 2021 after opposition politicians and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began being arrested following the imposition of a controversial new National Security Law.While in the UK she has frequently criticised China's Communist leadership and has spoken out about China's controversial plans to build a 'mega embassy' in London, warning that it could become a base for trans-national repression of China's critics abroad.Last year up to a dozen of the same neighbours in Berkshire had received letters sent from Hong Kong, and purporting to come from the police, offering a bounty payment of £95,000 to anyone who would take Ms Lau and hand her over to the Chinese embassy in London.The new letters were sent last month from the Chinese territory of Macau, close to Hong Kong.\"I was quite shocked because last time it wasn't explicit and so unpleasant to see,\" Ms Lau told the BBC.\"When I was in Hong Kong pro-Beijing agents were trained to use gender-based harassment targeting pro-democracy activists,\" she said, \"but AI technology has enhanced this sort of intimidation, it is beyond just transnational repression, as a woman it is very worrying\".Reynolds told the BBC \"the government need to be very clear that this is not acceptable, we cannot have these letters sent to UK residents\".\"We need to find out who sent these letters,\" he said, adding \"officials in Beijing need to be held accountable\".Reynolds said he had raised the issue with both the Home Office and the Foreign Office.A government spokesperson said \"the safety and security of Hong Kongers in the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance\".Ms Lau said police had told her they would be investigating.The government has previously insisted that any attempt by a foreign power to intimidate, harass, or harm individuals or communities would not be tolerated.It has said the UK continues to raise concerns about transnational repression directly with the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities, and has publicly condemned the issuing of arrest warrants and bounties by the Hong Kong Police Force.",

    "body": "Two brothers wanted in connection with a deadly fire at their nightclub in India's Goa state, which killed 25 people, have been detained in Thailand, India's ambassador to Thailand, Nagesh Singh, told the BBC.Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, who own Birch By Romeo Lane club, fled to Phuket, shortly after the incident earlier this week. \"They will be sent back [to India],\" Mr Singh said on Thursday, a day after a court in Delhi refused to grant them protection from arrest and the Goa government approached India's external affairs ministry to revoke their passports.The brothers have not made any public statements, but their lawyer told the court that they were being made victims of a \"witch hunt\". The incident took place early on Sunday, when a deadly blaze broke out at the club in a busy nightlife area of the tourist state.Investigators believe the fire was triggered by fireworks being set off inside the venue.Most of the victims were staff members, while five were tourists.Investigators say they raided the brothers' Delhi home hours after the fire but found they had fled the country. Police then sought Interpol's help to track them.Saurabh Luthra, whose social media identifies him as the chairman of the company which operates the club, posted a statement on social media on Monday expressing \"profound grief\".\"The management stands in unwavering solidarity with the families of the deceased as well as those injured,\" he wrote, adding that the nightclub's management would provide \"assistance, support and cooperation to the bereaved\".On Wednesday, Goa's Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the police has arrested six persons in connection with the incident so far, adding that \"more arrests will be made soon\".Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editorandArchie MitchellWatch: GSK boss Dame Emma Walmsley lays out competitions facing the UKThe US is the best place for a business to invest, the boss of one of the UK's biggest pharmaceutical companies has said.Dame Emma Walmsley, chief executive of vaccines and medicines giant GSK, said it will invest $30bn (£23bn) in the US by 2030.It comes as other major drug makers have pulled UK projects worth billions after years of frustration on NHS drug budgets and pressure from President Donald Trump to set up production in the US.However Dame Emma, who will leave GSK in January after eight years in charge, welcomed a new deal which will see the NHS pay more to help secure zero tariffs on shipping UK pharmaceuticals to America.Speaking to the BBC from the firm's central London headquarters, Dame Emma said she would not \"shy away\" from GSK's investment plans for the US, where it makes more than half of its turnover.The US is \"still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines,\" she said. And alongside China, it was \"the best market in the world to do business development,\" she added.GSK's latest stateside investment drive followed US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.UK drug maker AstraZeneca has also announced it is pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility while ploughing tens of billions of dollars into the US.Other drug companies have also said there is little appetite to invest in the UK which successive governments have insisted is a life sciences superpower. Despite the challenges facing Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, Dame Emma said the deal to scrap tariffs on UK drug shipments to the US was \"a step in the right direction\" for Britain.The deal means the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS - in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.Dame Emma said it was a welcome reversal of a long term decline in the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines compared to other countries' health systems. The move, she said, would encourage the kind of innovation that supports ground breaking new medicines like GSK's new asthma drug which can be taken twice a year and could slash hospital admissions by 70% for serious asthma sufferers.GSK hopes the new treatment will be approved for use by the NHS within weeks. Asked about the health of the country, she said there were \"social demographic root causes\" for its decline.She said UK health outcomes varied widely depending on where you live  \"you can probably get a 10 or 15-year difference in lifespan prospects depending on which postcode you're in.\"Dame Emma pointed to British diets and a lack of education around nutrition as part of the problem.  \"I think there's no question that the food system is fundamentally something we need to look at harder,\" she said.Dame Emma also opened up about the differences she has experienced between the NHS and the private healthcare system in the US, having given birth in London, Paris and twice in New York.\"Both the experience of childbirth and all the follow up that happens afterwards are very, very different,\" she said. \"Anything from the advice you're given...the frequency with which you are expected to be visited, how long you are in hospital and what kind of follow-up advice.\"Dame Emma said what matters is the balance of price, access and outcomes, and that the NHS still has \"work to do\" on getting the balance right.Dame Emma, who also sits on the board of Microsoft, said the world was on the cusp of major advances in health science thanks in part to advances in AI which promise to accelerate innovation \"90 % of the projects in our industry don't work, they take a decade and cost billions, getting to a place where you just double that to you know, instead of 10% working, 20% working will completely change the trajectory of innovation\"In the end, she said, few things are more important than health. \"It is one of the few things that every single person on the planet ends up caring about\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentPeople who might otherwise turn to friends, family, or social media influencers for financial advice are to be given new help to invest their money.Targeted support from registered banks and other financial firms is being given the go-ahead by the City regulator and should start in April.This will allow firms to make investment and pensions recommendations based on what similar groups of people could do with their money.It still falls short of individually tailored advice, which can only be provided by an authorised financial adviser for a fee.Nearly one in five people turned to family, friends or social media for help making financial decisions, according to a survey by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA, said the new regime would be \"game changing\". \"It means millions of people can get extra help to make better financial decisions,\" she said.\"We also hope it will build greater confidence to invest. While investing will not be right for everyone, we know people in the UK invest less compared to the EU or US.\"Investing money is not an option for millions of people. The regulator said that one in 10 people had no cash savings, and another 21% had less than £1,000 to draw on in an emergency.However, FCA data suggested about seven million adults in the UK with £10,000 or more in cash savings could receive better returns through investing.Investing does come with some risk as the value of an investment can go down as well as up, but the spending power of cash savings can be eroded by rising prices.The regulator said that many consumers who were in a position to invest but chose not to did so because they were unsure of their options, felt overwhelmed,  or needed more support. Only 9% of people surveyed received regulated advice on their pensions and investments in the 12 months to May 2024.Targeted support aims to bridge a gap between general guidance and information, and financial advisers who charge a fee.For example, banks could explain how a large pot of cash savings could be invested, or how investments could be spread out to reduce risk. Ms Pritchard told the BBC's Today programme that this was not about providing expensive financial advice tailored to an individual, but rather suggestions based on people's circumstances and characteristics.\"It's important that consumers understand what it is and what it isn't, and it's not detailed advice,\" she said.And unlike detailed financial advice, Ms Pritchard said this targeted support should be free.\"Commission is banned, [and] we're expecting most firms that do provide it, subject to our regulation, will be providing it free of charge to consumers,\" she said.Yvonne Braun, director of policy at the Association of British Insurers said: \"The FCA's new rules mark a significant step towards closing the advice gap and will empower millions.\"Some consumer groups have made clear that the new rules must not be a pathway to firms exploiting customers.The FCA said firms taking part would need to be authorised in advance. They might include banks, building societies, investment platforms and digital wallet providers.They would also be required to show that their recommendations were suitable and should only be offered when it put people in a better position, the regulator said. Any customer vulnerabilities would need to be identified and taken into account.Consumers will have the right to take any disputes that arise to the independent financial ombudsman.There will also be a move to allow people to make more informed decisions with their pensions.The regulator's new rules will require legislation, but the government has made it a clear objective to encourage people to invest. The Treasury believes this will help to create economic growth.It was one of the reasons for the decision by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to cut the annual allowance for cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) from £20,000 to £12,000 a year for under 65s, from April 2027.Separately, the FCA has launched a \"firm checker\" tool to help prevent people from losing money to fraudsters through investment scams.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesVictims of a deadly typhoon in the Philippines have filed a legal claim against oil and gas company Shell in the UK courts, seeking compensation for what they say is the company's role in making the storm more severe.Around 400 people were killed and millions of homes hit when Typhoon Rai slammed into parts of the Philippines just before Christmas in 2021.Now a group of survivors are for the first time taking legal action against the UK's largest oil company, arguing that it had a role in making the typhoon more likely and more damaging.Shell says the claim is \"baseless\", as is a suggestion the company had unique knowledge that carbon emissions drove climate change.Typhoon Rai, known locally as Odette, was the most powerful storm to hit the Philippines in 2021.With winds gusting at up to 170mph (270km/h), it destroyed around 2,000 buildings, displaced hundreds of thousands of people - including Trixy Elle and her family.She was a fish vendor on Batasan island when the storm hit, forcing her from her home, barely escaping with her life.\"So we have to swim in the middle of big waves, heavy rains, strong winds,\" she told BBC News from the Philippines.\"That's why my father said that we will hold our hands together, if we survive, we survive, but if we will die, we will die together.\"Trixy is now part of the group of 67 individuals that has filed a claim that's believed to be the first case of its kind against a UK major producer of oil and gas.Getty ImagesA family take shelter in the wake of Typhoon Rai which left hundreds of thousands of people homelessIn a letter sent to Shell before the claim was filed at court, the legal team for the survivors says the case is being brought before the UK courts as that is where Shell is domiciled – but that it will apply the law of the Philippines as that is where the damage occurred.The letter argues that Shell is responsible for 2% of historical global greenhouse gases, as calculated by the Carbon Majors database of oil and gas production.The company has \"materially contributed\" to human driven climate change, the letter says, that made the Typhoon more likely and more severe.The survivors' group further claims that Shell has a \"history of climate misinformation,\" and has known since 1965 that fossil fuels were the primary cause of climate change.\"Instead of changing their industry, they still do their business,\" said Trixy Elle.\"It's very clear that they choose profit over the people. They choose money over the planet.\"Getty ImagesShell's global headquarters is in London which is why the claim has been lodged at a UK courtShell denies that their production of oil and gas contributed to this individual typhoon, and they also deny any unique knowledge of climate change that they kept to themselves.\"This is a baseless claim, and it will not help tackle climate change or reduce emissions,\" a Shell spokesperson said in a statement to BBC News.\"The suggestion that Shell had unique knowledge about climate change is simply not true. The issue and how to tackle it has been part of public discussion and scientific research for many decades.\"The case is being supported by several environmental campaign groups who argue that developments in science make it now far easier to attribute individual extreme weathernevents to climate change and allows researchers to say how much of an influence emissions of warming gases had on a heatwave or storm.But proving, to the satisfaction of a court, that damages done to individuals by extreme weather events are due to the actions of specific fossil fuel producers may be a challenge.\"It's traditionally a high bar, but both the science and the law have lowered that bar significantly in recent years,\" says Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate law and litigation who is not connected with the case.\"This is certainly a test case, but it's not the first case of its kind. So this will be the first time that UK courts will be satisfying themselves about the nature of all of that attribution science from a factual perspective.\"The experience in other jurisdictions is mixed.In recent years efforts to bring cases against major oil and gas producers in the United States have often failed.In Europe campaigners in the Netherlands won a major case against Shell in 2021 with the courts ordering Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, including those emissions that come from the use of its products.But that ruling was overturned on appeal last year.There was no legal basis for a specific cuts target, the court ruled, but it also reaffirmed Shell's duty to mitigate dangerous climate change through its policies.The UK claim has now been filed at the Royal Courts of Justice, but this is just the first step in the case brought by the Filippino survivors with more detailed particulars expected by the middle of next year.",

    "body": "6 hours agoVisitors to the US may have to disclose their social media activity from the past five years in order to enter the country, according to the Guardian. The paper reports that the Trump administration intends to apply the new mandates to the 42 countries whose nationals can enter the US without a visa - which includes the UK. Author Sophie Kinsella is also pictured on the front page, after she died on Wednesday following a three-year battle with a glioblastoma, the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.The Metro also leads on the Trump administration's new immigration rules, noting that the move could impact fans travelling to the US for the World Cup next year. The i Paper reports that the UK could be set to rejoin the European Union's Erasmus programme from January 2027, detailing \"increasing optimism on both sides of negotiations\" that a deal could be struck by Christmas. The \"Brexit reset plan\" would allow young people in the UK and the EU to study abroad for up to a year.\"Net zero plan to cost households £500 a year,\" declares the Times, writing that the National Energy System Operator has found that the UK could save £14bn a year if it forgoes its legally binding target to reach net zero. The paper says the figures have been \"seized on\" by the Conservatives and Reform UK, each of whom have pledged to scrap the target.Argentinean President Javier Milei has spoken to the Telegraph, which reports that negotiations have begun between the UK and the South American nation to lift a weapons ban that has been in place since the Falklands War in 1982. Current British export rules restrict any weapon with British components from being sold to Argentina if they would \"enhance\" the country's military. Milei told the paper that the Falkland Islands would be returned to Argentina through \"diplomatic means\", and said he intended to visit the UK some time next year. The Mirror has focused on Labour's \"£3.5bn war on homelessness\", after Housing Minister Steve Reed vowed to \"build a future where homelessness is rare, brief and not repeated\". His new strategy was published on Thursday, and will be backed by £3.5bn in funding.The Daily Mail reports that campaigners have launched a legal action to halt an NHS-backed clinical trial of puberty-blocking drugs. The paper says that the trial has been branded as \"grotesque\" by Conservatives. British citizenship has been revoked from more than 200 people since 2010, via a system that the Independent suggests is \"racist\" in their leading story. It says that the UK's total is only surpassed by Bahrain and Nicaragua, and is the only G20 nation to strip people of their citizenship \"en masse\".A Suffolk archaeological site is pictured on the front page of the Financial Times, after new evidence of fire-making dating back 400,000 years was discovered earlier this year. The paper has also honed in on interest rates, following the Federal Reserve's \"divisive decision\" to cut them to the lowest level in three years.Sir Keir Starmer is accused of \"handing our country over\" to the EU on the front page of the Express, with the paper reporting that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has become the \"latest cabinet minister to hint at joining an EU customs union\". The Sun says Davina McCall has \"wed in secret\", claiming the television personality  married celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas in a \"tiny bash\" close to her home in Kent. \"Down to earth\" darts champion Luke Littler beams from the front page of the Daily Star, which says he only receives £50 a week in pocket money.The Times says ministers have been warned about the financial risks of their environmental aim to reach net zero by 2050. The National Energy System Operator - which the paper describes as \"the government body in charge of keeping the country's lights on\" - says the plan risks costing the UK £350bn more than a slower approach to reducing carbon emissions. A spokesperson for the energy department says they don't believe these costings accurately reflect the benefits of moving to clean energy.Many of the papers look in more detail at the Trump administration's proposal to ask tourists from dozens of countries - including the UK - to provide their social media history for the past five years. The Financial Times says the plans are likely to raise concerns within the travel industry - especially as the US prepares to co-host the men's World Cup next summer, with Mexico and Canada. The Guardian also picks up on this point, noting that FIFA expects five million fans at the games and millions more to visit the three countries. The Metro's headline is \"defensive trawl for World Cup fans\".Argentina's president Javier Milei has told the Daily Telegraph that talks with Britain are under way to lift a Falklands War-era weapons ban. UK export rules restrict any weapon with British components from being sold to Argentina if it \"enhances\" the country's military. A government spokesman has denied the claims, saying there are \"no specific talks\" taking place with Argentina about the UK \"relaxing its arms export controls\".According to the i Paper, the UK is set to sign a deal to rejoin the EU's student exchange scheme from January 2027. Talks are due to take place next week. The UK left the Erasmus programme after Brexit.And many papers highlight some of the more unusual heritage sites to be added to Historic England's listings this year. They include Second World War anti-tank defences in Surrey, known as dragon's teeth, and guide posts in Cheshire which were used to help early motorists. Historic England is quoted as saying these newly protected sites help connect us to the people and events that shaped our communities.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "1 hour agoKayla EpsteinWatch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coastUS forces have seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said, marking a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government.\"We have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela - a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.Releasing a video of the seizure, Attorney General Pam Bondi described the vessel as a \"crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\".Caracas swiftly denounced the action, calling it an act of \"international piracy\". Earlier, President Maduro declared that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".The Trump administration accuses Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US and has intensified its efforts to isolate President Maduro in recent months. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.Brent crude prices inched higher on Wednesday as news of the seizure stoked short-term supply concerns. Analysts warn the move could threaten shippers and further disrupt Venezuela's oil exports.US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the US Department of Justice, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the US Coast Guard co-ordinated the seizure.\"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" the nation's top prosecutor wrote on X.Footage shared by Bondi showed a military helicopter hovering over a large ship, and troops descending on to the deck using ropes. Uniformed men were seen in the clip moving about the ship with guns drawn.A senior military official told the BBC's US partner CBS that the helicopters used in the operation launched from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which was sent to the Caribbean last month.It involved two helicopters, 10 Coast Guard members and 10 Marines, as well as special forces.Watch: Venezuela’s Maduro sings \"Don't worry, be happy\" as he calls for peace with the USDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth was aware of the operation, and the Trump administration was considering more actions like this, a source told CBS.When asked by reporters what the US would do with the oil on the tanker, Trump said: \"We keep it, I guess... I assume we're going to keep the oil.\" Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech identified the vessel as the Skipper and said it believed the ship had been \"spoofing\" its position - or broadcasting a false location - for a long time.The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.BBC Verify located this tanker on MarineTraffic, which shows it was sailing under the flag of Guyana when its position was last updated two days ago. A statement from Guyana's Maritime Administration Department on Wednesday evening, however, said that the Skipper was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana.\"The Skipper's port of call log shows it called in Iran, Iraq, and the UAE from 30 June to 9 July this year. Its most recent stop, according to MarineTraffic, was at Soroosh port in Iran on 9 July, BBC Verify has found.That does not mean that it has not called at multiple other ports since then.MarineTraffic shows it was last near Iran in mid-September before arriving off the coast of Guyana at the end of October and making minimal further movement since then. This data may be partial or incorrect because of spoofing.MarineTraffic lists the beneficial owner and operator as Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures Ltd and it lists the registered owner as Marshall Islands-based Triton Navigation Corp.Watch: Trump says US has seized \"large tanker\" off Venezuela coastThe Venezuelan government issued a statement denouncing the seizure as a \"grave international crime\".Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called the US \"murderers, thieves, pirates\".He referred to Pirates of the Caribbean, but said that while that film's lead character Jack Sparrow was a \"hero\", he believed \"these guys are high seas criminals, buccaneers\".Cabello said this was how the US had \"started wars all over the world\".Speaking at a rally earlier on Wednesday, Maduro had a message for Americans opposed to war with Venezuela. It came in the form of a 1988 hit song.\"To American citizens who are against the war, I respond with a very famous song: Don't worry, be happy,\" Maduro said in Spanish before singing along to the lyrics of the 1988 hit.\"Not war, be happy. Not, not crazy war, not, be happy.\"It's unclear if Maduro knew about the seizure of the tanker before this rally.In recent days, the US has ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north.The build-up involves thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela, BBC Verify reported. The move has sparked speculation about the potential for some kind of military action.Since September, the US has conducted at least 22 strikes on boats in the region that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs. At least 80 people have died in these attacks.Ione Wells contributed to this report from Sao Paulo, Brazil.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesNorman Cook and Mick Jagger, pictured together at a David Bowie after-party in London, 1999One of the world's most bootlegged recordings - Fatboy Slim's Satisfaction Skank - is finally being released, after the Rolling Stones gave belated approval for the song's pivotal sample.Fatboy Slim, real name Norman Cook, created the track 25 years ago by grafting the riff from the Stones' Satisfaction onto his platinum-selling single The Rockafeller Skank, after he grew \"bored\" of playing the original.\"It was my secret weapon,\" he told BBC News. \"I had this tune that nobody else had, and it was a really good encore.\"In the 2000s, the song spread like wildfire on file-sharing sites like Napster and Kazaa but, until now, The Stones had refused to clear it for commercial release.Even Cook bought bootleg copies of the song, some of which had been taped off his live sets on BBC Radio 1 and pressed to vinyl. PA MediaNorman Cook has more pseudonyms than James Bond - including Fatboy Slim, Pizzaman and Mighty Dub KatzOver the years, there have been several attempts to get the sample approved.\"I got a call from Mick Jagger and he said he'd heard it and he liked the mix,\" recalled Cook.\"But his management was just like, 'No, not even negotiable'.\"Later, the Stones asked Cook to remix their 1968 single Sympathy For The Devil. Satisfaction Skank was due to be the b-side - but the deal ultimately fell apart.\"We've had a pretty flat 'no' for 20 years,\" said Cook. \"I think we asked four times, and I wouldn't have dared to ask them again.\"Instead, the initiative came from the Stones' side. They even gave Cook their master tapes, so he could create a higher-quality version of the original mix.It's a sign of how the band have become more relaxed about the re-use and re-contextualisation of their songs in recent years. In 2019, they even signed over their publishing stake in The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony. Previously, writer Richard Ashcroft had been forced to surrender all his royalties from the song, due to its sample of an orchestral cover of the Rolling Stones' The Last Time. He called the reversal \"life-affirming\".Getty ImagesKeith Richards wrote Satisfaction in his sleep and recorded a rough version of the song's iconic riff on a cassette player. When he woke, he had no recollection of the songSatisfaction Skank has been a staple of Fatboy Slim's live set for over a quarter of a century, but Cook says he can't remember the first time he played it.\"That's more of a testament to my state of mind and partying in those days, than to the historical importance of it,\" he said.However, he could recall debuting The Rockafeller Skank itself, at Brighton's Big Beat Boutique in early 1998.\"I was so excited, because I'd just finished it,\" he said. \"I remember playing it and everyone just going nuts. \"I got really, really excited and started shouting, 'That's me, that's me! That's my new single!'\"And everyone just went, 'Yeah, we guessed'.\"It went on to become a Top 10 hit, with promotional copies of the single describing it as \"dance music's Bohemian Rhapsody\".\"That was me, but I wasn't being self-aggrandising,\" he confessed to BBC News.\"As a music production fan, it's famous that Bohemian Rhapsody was made up of three different segments that they had to edit together. \"And with Rockafeller, we had to do the same. It was the early days of the internet, so I had to go round to my engineer's house to do the 'slowy down bit', because he had the software to make it work.\"Then I had to take that file back to my studio and edit all the bits together. \"So it wasn't my Bohemian Rhapsody in terms of being a Stone Cold classic. It's just that it was more complicated to make than everything I'd ever done.\"'I'll never retire'The release of Satisfaction Skank comes at the end of the busiest year of Cook's career. He's played 115 gigs (\"a personal best\") in dozens of countries, and published his first book - It Ain't Over... 'Til the Fatboy Sings.Filled with photos and memorabilia, the coffee table book reflects on the \"40 years since I quit my day job and ran off to join the circus\".He first found fame in the indie band The Housemartins, and was also the founder member of the dance music collective Beats International and funk-soul outfit Freak Power.Cook has also DJ'd and remixed under a variety of monikers,  including Pizzaman, Mighty Dub Katz and latterly Fatboy Slim.Now aged 62, he shows no signs of slowing down. In October, he announced the  continuation and expansion of a DJ workshop series for people dealing with serious mental health problems in Sussex - a programme which he helps to fund.\"Music has played a vital role in my own mental health journey, and it's a privilege to share that healing power with others,\" he told BBC Sussex.He'll start 2026 with gigs in Indonesia and Bali, followed by an extensive UK tour, and the resurrection of his Big Beach Boutique festival on Brighton's seafront.\"I think I've kind of realised now that my career will never be over,\" Cook said.\"I got a glimpse of what retirement looked like during lockdown - this abyss of lunches and golf - and I have no interest in that.  \"So now I think I'll keep working 'til I drop.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoAngus Crawford, BBC InvestigationsCorrespondentFacebookAdverts seen on Facebook showed tiger teeth, dried seahorses and shark fins for saleEndangered species, including tiger body parts, shark fins and pangolin scales, are being offered for sale on Facebook, BBC News has found.One Chinese user posted videos of a tiger in a cage that was for sale as well as pictures of tiger bones and teeth, while another included two live tiger cubs in a box.An image showed a tiger head and bones for sale piled up on scales.A seller told the BBC his products \"can be shipped to the UK\".He said a 10cm-long tooth would cost 2,000 Chines yuan (about £213) and that he could sell me tiger bones for 3,600 yuan per kilo (about £380).Another seller, who was offering shark fins, claimed to ship from the US to the UK and charged $50 per kilo (about £37).The sale of endangered species such as tigers and pangolin is illegal in the UK and CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, closely regulates international trade in species under threat. The voluntary agreement, signed by more than 180 countries and other bodies, only allows the trade if it is both legal and sustainable.It comes as Interpol has announced the results of a global crackdown on the wildlife trade, which it says led to the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals.Meta, which owns Facebook, says it does not allow the sale of endangered species and removes such content.The UK has strict laws on what species can be imported legally.However, BBC News also found British companies selling dried seahorses, which can only be traded in the UK if the seller can certify they were sustainably harvested.In practice, that's not possible and supplying them is likely to break the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, punishable by a fine or prison sentence.One seller was found promoting them as a tonic for mothers who have just given birth and as a medicine for combating coughs. There is no scientific evidence to support this.When contacted, the seller - based in the north of England - immediately sent pictures of the seahorses they had in stock. Ordering online cost just over £60.Two days after placing the order three packets containing 15 dead, dried seahorses arrived in the post.The delivery had no documentation about the origin of the specimens but did include a recipe on how to make soup with them.Five dead seahorses, with a pregnant male in the centre, bought from a supplier in the UKThe BBC showed the samples to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, who said it \"made him sick to his stomach\". He said they could only have been supplied illegally.Three pregnant males were among the order - male seahorses carry as many as 200 young.Mr Garrick-Maidment says that, kilo for kilo, seahorses are currently worth as much as silver and warned further price rises could mean they are fished to extinction.ReutersThe pangolin are easily recognised by their full armour of scalesThe global trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth £17bn per year and Interpol assesses it to be the fourth largest international crime type behind drugs smuggling, people smuggling and arms trafficking.The pangolin, which is the only mammal completely covered in scales, has become the most trafficked animal on earth and is now critically endangered.A seller in Laos was found to be offering pangolin scales for sale on Facebook. He told the BBC he charged $150 per kilo.One user even offered to sell rhino horn and suggested making contact via private message.In a statement, Meta said: \"We do not allow the sale of endangered species on our platforms.\"The social media platform says it takes down that kind of material as soon as it becomes aware of it, saying it encourages users to \"report any content they think may violate our policies\".Today Interpol announced the result of Operation Thunder, a month-long global initiative to combat the trade in endangered species.Authorities in 134 countries were involved in the operation which included the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals and 30 tonnes of animal parts.Interpol says the growth in live animal seizures is driven by the exotic pet trade, but the market in bushmeat is also on the rise.Rhino horn and live pangolins offered for sale by users on FacebookKenyan authorities seized 400kg of giraffe meat as part of the global crackdown and, in Belgium, primate flesh was found. More than 4,000 shark fins were also intercepted.Danny Hewitt, Border Force's director for UK command operations who oversaw the British arm of Op Thunder, said there had been a 73% increase in seizures compared to 2023. That included live snakes, tarantulas and lovebirds found hidden in vehicles stopped at the UK border.As populations move to the UK they drive demand, he added.The trade has been driven by organised crime, and in many cases, customers who don't understand the harm they are doing.Mr Hewitt added: \"They may not have been illegal in other parts of the world, but they are illegal in the UK.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentNext week's strike by resident doctors in England may be averted after ministers offered the British Medical Association a fresh deal.The doctors' union has agreed to put the offer to members over the coming days - if they support it, the five-day walkout starting on Wednesday 17 December could be called off.The offer includes a rapid expansion of specialist training posts as well as covering out-of-pocket expenses such as exam fees.But it does not include any promises of extra pay. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has been adamant he will not negotiate on that, given resident doctors - the new name for junior doctors - have had pay rises of nearly 30% over the past three years.The deal also includes emergency legislation being introduced so that the NHS can prioritise doctors who have studied and worked in the UK for speciality training posts that resident doctors move into in year three of their training.This year there was intense competition for these roles with 30,000 applicants going for 10,000 posts. Some of those will have been doctors from abroad who under current rules have to be judged on the same basis as UK doctors.The number of speciality posts will also increase by 4,000 by 2028 – with the first 1,000 of those available from next year. Previously, the government has promised an increase of  2,000.The BMA will now consult resident doctor members on whether this offer is sufficient to call off next week's strike. A survey of members will run online, closing on Monday 15 December, just two days before the strike is due to begin.This move prompted anger from Streeting who had wanted the union to call off next week's strike.Ministers fear that by Monday hospitals will have already had to cancel a significant number of treatments as part of their preparations to get ready for the strike.Streeting said he had offered to allow the BMA to extend its mandate, which runs out in the first week of January, so they could still stage a five-day strike if members did not back the deal.Streeting said he was \"astounded\" the BMA had not agreed to this given the difficulties hospitals are facing from flu and other winter pressures, which he said meant \"the spectre of strikes next week still looms\".\"I cannot understand the wilful casualness with which the BMA's leadership have chosen to inflict this pain on patients, other staff and the NHS itself,\" he said. \"It is one of the most shameful episodes in the long history of the BMA.\"He added: \"The NHS leaders are going to have to start cancelling other doctors' leave now to cover potential strikes, and patients will also experience unnecessary and avoidable disruption through some cancelled appointments and operations. That's on the BMA.\"On the offer, he said: \"Doctors asked me to deliver on jobs, especially unfair competition from overseas, and this comprehensive offer will deliver.\"BMA resident doctors committee chairman, Dr Jack Fletcher, said: \"This offer is the result of thousands of resident doctors showing that they are prepared to stand up for their profession and its future.\"It should not have taken strike action, but make no mistake: it was strike action that got us this far.\"We have forced the government to recognise the scale of the problems and to respond with measures on training numbers and prioritisation. \"However, this offer does nothing to restore pay for doctors, which remains well within the government's power to do.\"Streeting later said in the Commons he would retract the government's offer if the BMA rejected it, so as not to \"incentivise\" further strikes.Shadow Health Secretary Stuart Andrew said the strike was \"unacceptable\" and welcomed the government's offer.But he said the Conservatives had warned that providing \"inflation-busting pay rises without any conditions at all\" meant unions would \"come back for more\".\"If they reject this, what's going to happen? I'm not sure government is ready for this winter.\"The BMA argues that despite the pay rises of the last few years, pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008 once inflation is taken into account.If members indicate in the online survey the offer is enough to call off next week's strikes, a formal referendum of resident doctors would follow. This would give members time to consider the details of the offer and whether to accept it and end the current dispute, the BMA said.If the survey of members decides it is not enough to call off strikes, they will go ahead as planned next week, the union added.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Author Sophie Kinsella remembered as a 'wonderful, warm woman'14 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Sophie Kinsella's books have sold more than 50 million copies in more than 60 countriesSophie Kinsella, author of the bestselling Shopaholic series of novels, has been remembered as a \"wonderful, warm woman\" following her death at the age of 55.The writer, whose real name is Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022.Me Before You author Jojo Moyes, who has known Kinsella for 20 years, told BBC News she had \"never met anybody who carried more grace\".\"She was incredibly kind, incredibly smart, and she wore her success and her brilliance so lightly,\" she said.\"There was not a person who met her who didn't light up in her presence, because she was just good and kind, and people felt that through her characters,\" Moyes told the BBC's David Sillito.\"She was one of the best people I've ever met... I feel really glad to have known her, really lucky to have had her in my life.\"How 'little treats' helped Sophie Kinsella through cancerKinsella's books have sold more than 50 million copies in more than 60 countries, and have been translated into more than 40 languages.Author Jodi Picoult said Kinsella \"will be missed greatly\", while fellow novelist Adele Parks described her as a \"wonderful, warm woman\" who \"brought so much joy to the world\".\"She'll be missed so much but celebrated too and will live on in millions of minds and hearts,\" Parks said.Writer Jenny Colgan told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive: \"When you do lose someone close it can be hard to communicate [who they were] but everybody who has ever read a Sophie Kinsella novel, that is what she was like. She was really funny, really warm.\"Actress Isla Fisher, who starred in the 2009 film adaption Confessions of a Shopaholic, said she was \"absolutely heartbroken\" following Kinsella's death.\"You are still my hero, and I'm grateful for you,\" she wrote in her tribute to the author on Instagram. \"Though we won't meet again, your light and magic lives on in your incredible characters.\"Sarah CresswellKinsella, pictured in 2024, had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancerKinsella announced in 2024 that she had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma two years earlier.In a statement on Wednesday, her family said they were \"heartbroken\" to announce the death of \"our beloved Sophie\".\"She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy.\"They continued: \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"Despite her illness, which she bore with unimaginable courage, Sophie counted herself truly blessed - to have such wonderful family and friends, and to have had the extraordinary success of her writing career. \"She took nothing for granted and was forever grateful for the love she received. She will be missed so much our hearts are breaking.\"'Unique voice'A statement from Kinsella's publisher said she \"defined and elevated romantic comedy by populating her stories with real-life issues that combined wit, emotional depth and societal insight\".Bill Scott-Kerr, her longstanding publisher at Transworld, described Kinsella as \"our author, our cheerleader, our fellow conspirator and our friend\".He added: \"Maddy leaves behind a glorious and indelible legacy, a unique voice, an unquenchable spirit, a goodness of intent and a body of work that will continue to inspire us to reach higher and be better, just like so many of her characters.\"British romantic comedy writer Jill Mansell offered: \"Maddy was a brilliant writer but more importantly a truly lovely person.\"In both respects she brought so much joy to the world.\"Sarah CresswellThe author's agents Araminta Whitley and Marina de Pass described Kinsella as \"an intelligent, imaginative, loving and irreverent woman who valued the deeply connective power of fiction\".\"She had a rare gift for creating emotionally resonant protagonists and stories that spoke to, and entertained, readers wherever they were in the world and whatever challenges they faced.\"They added: \"She also had an unmatched wit and ability to find the funny side. \"Comedy, for her, was both an art form and an intellectual pursuit and she instinctively understood that it is often a tightrope act of balancing light with dark.\"Moyes agreed, telling the BBC: \"The big mistake people make with Sophie's books is they assume they were easy [to write] because they're easy to read.\"But anybody who's tried to replicate them knows that she was a master plotter, and a master at characterisation. She was a genius, actually.\"Getty ImagesKinsella wrote last year that she had \"always processed my life through writing\"Kinsella was born in London in 1969, and studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to philosophy, politics and economics. She wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, aged 24 under her married name Madeleine Wickham, while working as a financial journalist.\"My overriding concern was that I didn't write the autobiographical first novel,\" she told the Guardian in 2012. \"I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. \"It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I'm not just writing about my life, I'm a real author.\"The book was acclaimed by critics and became a top 10 bestseller. She released six further novels as Madeleine Wickham.Five years later, writing as Sophie Kinsella, she published The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic - also known as Confessions of a Shopaholic.It introduced readers to Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist who is a serial shopper and hopeless when it comes to her own finances, often buying new clothes or shoes on her credit card rather than saving her money.\"I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,\" Kinsella said of her bestselling series.Getty ImagesA film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic starring Isla Fisher was released in 2009After its huge success, Kinsella went on to write eight further Shopaholic novels and a short story, and another 18 books in total, including one young adult novel and four children's books.Kinsella's other works include Can You Keep A Secret? and The Undomestic Goddess.Her books were occasionally referred to as \"chick lit\" - a description she did not fully endorse\"When I hear the term 'chick lit', I feel a pinprick of, not annoyance but of slight resignation,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2018. \"'Oh, this again…' \"I've never had anyone say to my face, 'Your books are inferior,' but if people say, 'Your books are beach reads,' I say, 'Yep, that's fine by me. Read them on the beach!'\"Kinsella's most recent novella, What Does It Feel Like?, published in October 2024, was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, written after she had surgery.In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing\".\"Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe.\"Kinsella is survived by her husband Henry and their five children.What is a glioblastoma?Glioblastomas are the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.About 3,200 people are diagnosed with a glioblastoma every year in the UK. Of these, just 160 survive for five years or more.It's a type of cancer that grows quickly - glioblastomas are likely to spread within the brain and come back even after being removed.Symptoms vary, but can include headaches caused by a build-up of pressure, personality changes, and memory problems. People may also have trouble speaking or experience extreme tiredness, depression, seizures and sight problems.Common treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or if a patient is well enough, a surgeon will try to remove as much cancer as possible during an operation.",

    "body": "The US National Park Service (NPS) is removing Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth from its list of fee-free entrance days.The move is part of President Donald Trump's \"modernisation\" of the park service, which, beginning in 2026, also includes changing the parks' cost structure to favour American citizens over foreign visitors, following a July executive order from Trump.In addition to removing the two holidays that celebrate civil rights leader MLK Jr and the end of slavery in the US, the agency is adding Flag Day, which is also Trump's birthday, as a \"patriotic\" fee-free day. People who are not US citizens will still have to pay fees on the fee-free dates, the NPS said.For the 2026 calendar year, US residents will be granted free access to national parks on President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/President Trump's birthday, Independence Day weekend, 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt's birthday and Veteran's Day.Previously, Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth were both deemed fee-free entry days by the Biden administration.Under the Trump administration's new rules, US residents will continue to pay $80 (£60) for an annual park service pass. The Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, announced last month that the annual pass will cost non-residents $250, and those without the pass will pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. \"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. In May, the department estimated in its budget proposal for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would rake in more than $90 million per year.  This isn't the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led multiple agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. ",

    "body": "A drone attack on the town of Kalogi, in Sudan's South Kordofan region, is said to have hit a kindergarten and killed at least 50 people, including 33 children. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organisation, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army.There was no immediate comment from the RSF. The RSF in turn accused the army of hitting a market on Friday in a drone attack in the Darfur region, on a fuel depot at the Adre border crossing with Chad.Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023 when a power struggle broke out between the RSF and the army, who were formerly allies .The reports could not be verified independently.   According to the army-aligned foreign ministry, the kindergarten was struck twice with missiles from drones.Civilians and medics who rushed to the school were also attacked, it added.Responding to reports of the attack in Kalogi, a spokesman for the UN children's agency Unicef said: \"Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.\"\"Children should never pay the price of conflict,\" Sheldon Yett added.The agency, he said, urged \"all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need\".The RSF accused the army of attacking the Adre crossing because it was used for the \"delivery of aid and commercial supplies\". According to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict, the attack caused civilian casualties and significant damage to a market.The military did not immediately comment on the reports from Darfur.Wedged between Sudan's capital Khartoum and Darfur, the region made up of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan has been a frontline in the civil war.The battle for the Kordofans - which have a population of almost eight million - has intensified as the army pushes towards Darfur.",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself,'\" said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, said the governor in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

    "body": "3 hours agoEmma RossiterTake Back PowerFour people have been arrested after custard and apple crumble were flung at a display case containing part of the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.Police were called shortly before 10:00 GMT on Saturday after the case containing the Imperial State Crown - which is typically worn by the King at formal ceremonies - was defaced.The Metropolitan Police said four people had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. The Tower's Jewel House was temporarily closed to the public while the police investigated.Take Back Power - which appears to be an offshoot of Just Stop Oil and which describes itself as a new non-violent civil resistance group - has claimed it was behind the incident.The group said it carried out the stunt to demand the UK government establishes a permanent citizen's assembly, or \"House of the People\", with the power to \"tax extreme wealth and fix Britain\".Policing minister Sarah Jones said that the incident was \"disgraceful\", adding: \"There is a clear difference between the democratic right to protest and unacceptable behaviour.\"Footage shared by Take Back Power on social media showed one protester removing a large foil tray of crumble from a bag before slamming it against the glass protecting the Imperial State Crown.Another then poured a tub of bright yellow custard on the front of the case.\"Democracy has crumbled,\" one protester could be heard shouting. Another added: \"Britain is broken. We've come here to the jewels of the nation to take back power.\"Meanwhile, surprised tourists could be seen reacting to the stunt.Historic Royal Palaces confirmed that the Imperial State Crown was not damaged.The Jewel House reopened to the public early in the afternoon.This is the second demonstration claimed by the group in the past few days.On Wednesday, three protesters emptied bags of manure onto the floor of the Ritz hotel lobby under its 25ft Christmas tree.Take Back Power has emerged in recent weeks on social media channels used by Just Stop Oil activists. The environmental protest group refers to Take Back Power as a \"new project\".Just Stop Oil - responsible for a number of high-profile protests including throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers and climbing onto motorway gantries - announced it was ending its use of direct action in March.The Imperial State Crown is a famous symbol of the monarchy and was worn by King Charles III as he left Westminster Abbey on his coronation day in 2023.Beyond coronations, the priceless working crown is only used during formal occasions, such as the State Opening of Parliament.When it is not being used, it is kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.It was originally made in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and contains 2,868 diamonds, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, four rubies and 269 pearls and weighs over a kilogram.",

    "body": "20 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterA lifestyle app backed by Sarah Ferguson received more than £1m of taxpayers' money but collapsed without ever launching a product, according to documents filed this week.vVoosh was founded by Manuel Fernandez, a close friend of Ms Ferguson, who once described herself as an \"ambassador\" for the company and was an investor.It promised to give users \"the power to Find, Plan, Share, Live, and Remember all the things you love to do - and those you're yet to try.\"Ms Ferguson and Mr Fernandez did not respond to requests for comment.vVoosh was put into administration last month - and its failure will raise further questions about the judgement of the former duchess and the business relationships she pursued.Over the years the company raised approximately £9m, including more than £1m from the UK government through research and development tax credits, according to documents filed by the administrator.It paid teams in the UK and then India to work on the app, but never launched it, and so had no income to fund further development.Progress on the app stopped when the Indian contractor threatened legal action.The administrator's report describes a \"breakdown in communication between the current directors/major creditors and the founder [Mr Fernandez], who ceased communication following [his] resignation as a director earlier in the year\".The report says that the company is owed £324,609 by a former director. This is believed to be Mr Fernandez, who is the only director to leave the company since 2019.Last summer he sold his house in North London for £1.3m, according to Land Registry documents, and is believed to have left the UK.Meanwhile, vVoosh owes £50,000 to one of Ms Ferguson's companies, La Luna Investments, which also held just under 1% of the company's shares.Documents show the firm had more than 60 other small shareholders - many with addresses in Essex and London, though a few American addresses also appear.The administrators said that there was \"significant uncertainty\" over how much money the company's creditors would get back once the company was wound up.One of the firm's American backers, Mark Guzy, has put more than £400,000 into the company to preserve \"certain essential services\" and protect the value of its software platform, which is the company's main remaining asset.vVoosh originally intended to share 10% of its profits with a charitable foundation.The BBC understands that the Charity Commission has now begun the process of removing vVoosh Charitable Foundation from the register of charities, on the basis that it does not operate.It is more than four-and-a-half years overdue with its reporting. HMRC declined to respond to questions about the tax credits. Mr Guzy and the other directors of vVoosh declined to comment.Earlier this month Mr Fernandez denied taking money out of the firm, according to the Times.He told the newspaper that allegation would be \"disproven in the course of legal proceedings\".Ms Ferguson, 66, lost her duchess title when her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, relinquished use of his Duke of York title over his links with Epstein. He has since been stripped of the title of prince as well. Last month it emerged that a crypto-currency mining firm had agreed to pay her up to £1.4m for acting as a \"brand ambassador\" - that firm also failed, allegedly costing investors millions. Its co-founder denied misconduct and said he was working to repay backers. In September, a number of charities dropped her as a patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called sex offender Jeffrey Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him. Mr Fernandez went to school at Billericay in Essex, and was a soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held senior sales roles at a number of tech companies before founding vVoosh in 2010.He was regularly photographed with the then duchess in 2015 and 2016, and they attended Sir Bob Geldof's wedding together, but she denied rumours they were a couple, saying they were just \"good friends\".Correction 6 December: An earlier version included financial figures for vVoosh charitable foundation, taken from the Charity Commission website, but the charity never traded.",

    "body": "10 hours agoHelen Catt,political correspondent,andTabby WilsonTrans women will not be able to take part in the main session at the Labour Women's Conference next year.It follows a legal review into how the event should operate after the Supreme Court ruled in April that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities legislation.Trans women will not be able to take part in formal proceedings, including speeches in the main hall and policy debates, but will be able to attend fringe events, which will be open to everyone regardless of their sex.It is understood the party considers the format to be the least restrictive way of balancing accessibility and compliance with the law.The Women's Conference, which is usually held the day before the party's annual conference in the same venue, was cancelled in 2025 after the party received legal advice in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.Prior to that ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in \"positive action\" measures such as all-women shortlists.Labour launched a \"comprehensive legal review\" of the rules around its women's conference following the Supreme Court decision, a spokesperson said, before confirming the 2026 event would go ahead with new attendance rules in a place.The spokesperson continued: \"This reflects our commitment to addressing the under-representation of women in the Party and compliance with the law.\"It comes as the government continues to weigh a new code of practice in light of the ruling, guidance which issued to public bodies and businesses on how to apply the Equality Act.The code has been redrafted by the equality watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and submitted to the government for ministerial sign off before coming into force.Equalities minister Bridget Phillipson received the draft three months ago but said she would take the time needed to \"get this right\" before publishing. The EHRC under its current leadership has previously called on the government to sign off on the guidance quickly. Outgoing EHRC head Baroness Falkner of Margravine told the Times she was \"so certain\" of the lawfulness of the guidance and suggested one explanation for the delay could be that the government was \"terrified of their MPs who would wish for trans self-identification or trans inclusion to prevail across all areas of society\".She said the delay had led to a \"grey zone\" being created around single-sex spaces.\"Some organisations are implementing [the ruling] in one way, others are not,\" Baroness Falkner said.In response, a government spokesperson said it was \"unapologetic about taking the time to produce legally sound guidance\".They added \"rushed and flawed guidance\" would be \"utterly catastrophic and fail women across our country\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemReutersFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNardine SaadandHarry SekulichRussia has launched a major aerial bombardment against Ukrainian infrastructure targets as talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida are set to enter a third day.Overnight Russia launched 653 drones and 51 missiles, most of which were downed, authorities said. One strike hit a railway hub at the town of Fastiv southwest of Kyiv, destroying the main station building and damaging rolling stock.Russia says it targeted military-industrial sites, and energy and port infrastructure.Condemning the new attacks, French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would go to London on Monday for a meeting with Ukrainian, British and German leaders aimed at putting pressure on Moscow. \"We must continue to put pressure on Russia to force it towards peace,\" Macron posted on X.He said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in London to take stock of the ongoing negotiations being mediated by the US.     Earlier US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow failed to produce a breakthrough.Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure in recent weeks. On Saturday Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian attacks had hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts. Zelensky said the attack on the rail hub had been \"meaningless from a military point of view, and the Russians could not have been unaware of this\".Meanwhile the UN's nuclear watchdog said the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had temporarily lost all external power overnight - the 11th time this has happened since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour.While it is not currently producing electricity, it needs power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.In Florida, a statement posted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff said two days of talks with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, had been \"constructive\".Witkoff and Umerov \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" that could such an agreement and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\", their statement said without giving details.The prospect of ending the war depended on Russia's readiness to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\", the statement added.The negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday. The Florida talks saw Ukraine's team briefed on a recent meeting between Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Witkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on a draft US peace plan. The Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.On Friday, Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".Kyiv pushed for revisions to the initial US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. An updated version has not been shared publicly.Major points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In an interview with India Today on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".Kyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees. Russia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoJames DelaneyBBC ScotlandLord Malcolm Offord was welcomed on stage by Nigel FarageThe former Conservative business and Scotland Office Minister, Lord Malcolm Offord, has defected to Reform UK.He was unveiled by Nigel Farage at a rally at the Macdonald Inchyra hotel in Falkirk on Saturday.Lord Offord was the serving Treasurer of the Scottish Conservatives and served on the Lords front bench from 2021 until 2024. Until his resignation on Saturday he was Conservative spokesman in the Lords on energy.He told the rally he planned to stand down from the Lords and campaign as a candidate for Reform in the 2026 Holyrood elections.Announcing his defection, Lord Offord accused the Conservatives of \"giving up\" on Scotland.He called the party \"parochial, not political\" and described them as a \"party without a vision\".\"I'm concerned for Scottish politics, very concerned about what happens in Scotland,\" he said.\"And that's why I'm leaving the Scottish Conservative Party, because the Scottish Conservative Party, I believe, have given up on Scotland and, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do that.\"He added: \"From today, for the next five months, day and night, I shall be campaigning with all of you tirelessly for two objectives.\"The first objective is to remove this rotten SNP government after 18 years, and the second is to present a positive vision for Scotland inside the UK, to restore Scotland to being a prosperous, proud, healthy and happy country.\"It is not possible to renounce a life peerage, but peers can resign their membership of the House of Lords.Members of the House of Lords are disqualified from becoming members of the Scottish Parliament under legislation passed earlier this year.PA MediaFarage said Offord would help take Reform \"to a new level\"Reform has one MSP at Holyrood, the former Conservative Graham Simpson, who defected to the party in August.Farage  said he was \"delighted\" to welcome Lord Offord to Reform, describing his defection as \"a brave and historic act\".He added: \"He will take Reform UK Scotland to a new level.\"A spokesperson for the Scottish Conservatives said: \"Any vote for Reform next year will only tighten the SNP's grip on power at Holyrood.\"Nigel Farage has been clear he is fine with John Swinney staying as first minister, his party stood pro-independence candidates in the last election, and he is still courting others who would break up the UK.\"SNP MP Stephen Gethins said he was not surprised to see a \"convergence between the Conservatives and Reform\".He told BBC Scotland News: \"Nigel Farage has got a dreadful track record and the SNP are going to take him on on it at the Holyrood elections.\"Instead of leaning into Reform's policy agenda, which has failed, as Labour and the Conservatives are doing, the SNP stands against everything Reform is for.\"Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie called Reform a \"party of failed Conservatives playing political musical chairs\".She said: \"This defection proves what we already know, Reform aren't even Tories in disguise anymore, they are just Tories - the same Tories that broke the immigration system, collapsed the economy and left working Scots to pay the price.\"This isn't change - it's the same failed politicians and failed ideas trying to divide our country.\"Meanwhile, Patrick Harvie, Scottish Greens constitutional spokesman, said: \"Reform is the party of the super rich. They have no interest in improving the lives of ordinary people and families.\"Who is Lord Malcolm Offord?Lord Offord, who founded investment firm Badenoch and Co, was made a life peer in 2021 under Boris Johnson.He had previously donated almost £150,000 to the Conservative party.Following his peerage, he became Baron Offord of Garvel, of Greenock in the County of Renfrew, and was appointed as a junior minister in the Scotland office.He also served as served as a minister of exports from 2023 until the general election in June 2024.He was previously director of the Vote No Borders campaign during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.The group attracted controversy after being forced to withdraw a cinema advert which claimed Scots would lose access to the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the event of a Yes vote.The hospital complained about the message, saying it did not endorse the content and was not consulted prior to it being broadcast.Lord Offord also stood as a Conservative list candidate for the Lothian region in the 2021 Holyrood election, but finished fifth and did not gain a seat.Malcolm Offord isn't a household name, but Reform's Scottish operation will be very happy to have him on board.He's held a number of UK government ministerial posts, and was a serving Conservative frontbencher in the House of Lords.He wants to be a candidate at the next Holyrood election. And he'll bring both business and political experience to the party.Taking to the stage in Falkirk, he complained about the \"monopolitics\" of Labour and the Conservatives. He seems to have fallen out of love with his old party.The crowd here was delighted to welcome him, despite his very recent Tory past.But, some of his old colleagues aren't too sad to see him go.One Scottish Conservative insider messaged me calling him a \"treacherous snake\".

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans. From here, they continue to countries like Germany, France, and the UK.Barbara Zanon/Getty ImageMost migrants who arrive in Trieste via the Balkan route are maleAfter four months of being exploited in Libya, Esther escaped and crossed the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy from which she was rescued by the Italian coast guard and taken to the island of Lampedusa.She claimed asylum three times before she was granted refugee status.Asylum seekers from countries viewed as safe are often rejected. At the time Italy viewed Nigeria as unsafe, but two years ago it changed that assessment as governments across Europe began tightening their rules in response to the big migrant influx into Europe of 2015-16. Voices calling for further restrictions on asylum claims have only grown louder since.\"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way,\" says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right wing government. \"We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them.\"\"We have to be hard-headed,\" warns Rakib Ehsan at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange. \"We need to prioritise women and girls who are at immediate risk within conflict-affected territories, where rape is being used as a weapon of war.\"Currently this is not happening consistently, he argues, and while he sympathises with the plight of women facing hazardous routes into Europe \"the key is controlled compassion\".However, many women arriving from countries considered safe claim that the abuse they suffered on account of being a woman has meant that life in their home countries has become impossible.This was the case for Nina, a 28-year-old from Kosovo.\"People think everything is well in Kosovo, but that's not true,\" she says. \"Things are terrible for women.\"Nina says she and her sister were sexually abused by their boyfriends who forced them into sex work.A 2019 report by Europe's OSCE security organisation suggested that 54% of women in Kosovo had experienced psychological, physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15.Women who face persecution on the grounds of gender-based violence are entitled to asylum under the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention, and that was backed up by a landmark ruling by the EU's top court last year. The Convention details gender-based violence as psychological, physical and sexual - and includes female genital mutilation (FGM).However, its terms are not yet applied consistently, according to charity groups.\"A lot of asylum officials in the field are men who are insufficiently trained to deal with such a delicate issue [as female genital mutilation] - both medically and psychologically,\" says Marianne Nguena Kana, Director of End FGM European Network.Many women have their asylum claims denied, she says, on the mistaken assumption that, because they have already undergone FGM, they face no further risk.\"We've had judges saying: 'You've already been mutilated, so it's not dangerous for you to go back to your country, because it's not like they can do it to you again,\" Nguena Kana says.International Rescue CommitteeThe International Rescue Committee works with migrants and refugees in ItalyWhen it comes to sexual violence, Carenza Arnold from UK charity Women for Refugee Women says it is often harder to prove, as it does not leave the same scars as physical torture - and the taboos and cultural sensitivities for women make the process even harder.\"Women are frequently rushed through the process and may not disclose the sexual violence they have suffered to an immigration officer they have just met,\" Arnold explains.Much of the violence faced by women takes place during their journey, the International Organization for Migration has told the BBC.\"Women usually escape sexual violence from their partners in their country of origin, and then during the journey, they experience the same again,\" says Ugochi Daniels.This was the case for Nina and her sister on their journey away from their abusive partners in Kosovo to a new life in Italy. Travelling with other women, they trekked through the forests of Eastern Europe trying to avoid the authorities. There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoCatherine Burns,Health correspondent,Vicki Loader,Health producerandHarriet AgerholmGetty ImagesHundreds of GPs across England have told the BBC they think mental health problems are being over-diagnosed. One commonly-held view by family doctors, our research suggests, is that society tends to over-medicalise normal life stresses. But they're also concerned about how hard it is to get help for patients with mental health conditions.Earlier this week, the Health Secretary ordered an independent review into the reasons for a rising demand for mental health, ADHD and autism services in England, and where the gaps in support are.BBC News sent a questionnaire to more than 5,000 GPs in England asking about their experiences helping patients with mental health concerns. Their responses give an insight into how challenging this issue is for many family doctors.Of the 752 GPs who took part in our research, 442 said they believed that over-diagnosis is a concern. More said mental health problems were over-diagnosed by a little than over-diagnosed by a lot.Eighty-one GPs who responded felt that mental health problems were under-diagnosed.Over-diagnosis of mental health issues was far from their only concern. Many GPs also told us they were worried about a lack of help for patients.For our questionnaire, GPs answered several questions and were invited to leave anonymous comments.One of the most common themes to emerge can be summed up in this remark from a GP: \"Life being stressful is not an illness.\"Another commented: \"As a society we seem to have forgotten that life can be tough - a broken heart or grief is painful and normal, and we have to learn to cope.\"Yet another argued that giving people labels such as anxiety or depression \"over-medicalises life and emotional difficulties\", and that this was taking resources away from people with severe needs.A small number of GPs were strongly critical of some patients. One described them as \"dishonest, narcissistic… gaming a system free at point of use.\"Overall, one in five adults in England report having a common mental health condition, like anxiety or depression, according to a survey published by NHS England. Rates are even higher in young people. For 16-24 year olds, it's one-in-four.The GPs who took part in our research identified 19-34 year olds as the age group who needed the most support with mental health issues.One commented that young adults \"seem to be less resilient since Covid\", suggesting they're more concerned with getting a diagnosis than finding coping strategies.But other GPs said the real issue was under-diagnosis.\"People need to be accepted, helped and encouraged to live life,\" one said, while another said services were very reluctant \"to fully assess and diagnose\" patients.There are almost 40,000 fully-qualified GPs in England and we cannot know if the group who took part in our research is representative of all family doctors.We asked GPs who had been in the job for at least five years how the amount of time they spend working on mental health has changed. Almost all said it has increased.The three main reasons they gave for this were:having to support patients who can't get good quality mental health help elsewherepractical issues like housing, employment or finances impacting patients' mental healthpatients thinking they have a mental health issue, when they're dealing with normal challenges in lifeEarlier this year, the health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that mental health conditions were being over-diagnosed and too many people were being \"written off\". He now says his comments were \"divisive\" and that \"he failed to capture the complexity of this problem.\"It is thought that 2.5 million people in England have ADHD – including those without a diagnosis. Some NHS services for ADHD have closed their doors to new patients because they are struggling to cope with the demand.Patients have told the BBC about how hard they find it to get proper care and support.All in all, there's a consensus that the NHS is not meeting rising demand in this area.A clear majority of GPs who took part in our research, 508 of 752, said there was rarely or never enough good quality mental health help available for adults in their area.Even more, some 640 GPs, told us they were worried about getting young patients the help they needed.One GP called mental health support \"a national tragedy\". Another said: \"A child literally needs to be holding a knife to be taken seriously and the second that knife is put down, services disengage.\"We also asked GPs if they ever prescribe medication because they worry patients will not get other help, such as talking therapies, quickly enough.The most common answer - from 447 GPs - is that they do this \"routinely\".\"I find myself regularly reaching for antidepressants, which I know may only help short term and won't help prevent recurrence,\" one GP commented.Professor Victoria Tzortziou Brown, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said there's a \"difficult balance\" for family doctors to strike when patients expect a diagnosis for mental health problems, but don't meet the criteria.\"We must be careful, as a society, not to medicalise the full range of normal feelings and behaviours and ensure GPs are not pressured into making diagnoses that conflict with their clinical judgement,\" she said.\"But equally we must avoid dismissing genuine mental health concerns as 'over-diagnosis' which risks discouraging people from seeking help.\"The independent review into demand for mental health services has promised to listen to all the evidence and come up with \"genuinely useful\" recommendations.Minesh Patel, associate director of policy and influencing at mental health charity Mind, said there was \"no credible evidence\" that mental health problems were being over-diagnosed.\"What we do know though is that the number of people experiencing mental health problems has increased, with 1 in 5 adults now living with a common mental health condition according to the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey,\" he said.Additional reporting by Elena Bailey and Phil Leake.",

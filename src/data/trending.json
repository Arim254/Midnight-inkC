    "body": "At least four people have been killed in a mass shooting at a child's birthday party in California.Ten others were injured in the shooting at a restaurant on Saturday evening, in the state's northern city of Stockton.Local police say the victims include adults and children. The conditions of the injured have not been confirmed.A suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".The San Joaquin county sheriff's office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Spokesperson Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited. \"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities. Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"California has some of the strictest laws on firearms in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.In 2021, a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle. The following year, the Supreme Court expanded US gun rights as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "16 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterZarah Sultana has accused leading figures in the new party she is founding with Jeremy Corbyn of carrying out a \"witch hunt\" to purge left-wing activists.Sultana boycotted the first day of the founding conference of the project, currently operating under the name Your Party, after several members who also belonged to the Socialist Workers Party were expelled.Party officials said the expulsions were for breaching rules that ban members from joining any other political party in the UK or abroad.Sultana's comments came as Corbyn used his conference speech to call for unity as the party had \"a unique opportunity\" to found \"a socialist party of mass appeal\".She told the BBC one of her staff had also been denied a pass for the conference. Your Party officials confirmed a pass had not been issued but denied the decision had been politically motivated. A spokesperson for Sultana said: \"This witch hunt is indefensible - we must build a party that welcomes all socialists.\"Asked by the BBC if she stood by the claim there was a witch hunt, Sultana said: \"Absolutely.\"\"And it is disgusting to see the type of behaviour we have seen in the Labour Party,\" she added. \"It's a toxic culture we're not seeking to replicate here.\"Sultana said \"nameless and faceless bureaucrats\" were \"working in the shadows\" to expel people \"without the membership actually voting on it\".Members of other groups \"shouldn't be made to choose\" between their membership and \"our new party\", Sultana said.A Your Party spokesman said: \"Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules - and these rules were enforced. \"We're focused on hosting a democratic founding conference with thousands of members coming together to debate and decide the big issues. \"This is politics outside the Westminster mould: from the ground up, not the top down.\"During his speech, Corbyn admitted there had been \"mistakes\" during the party's turbulent founding - a process that has seen Sultana frequently at odds with party officials and two MPs resign from the project.Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed quit within a week of each other, citing internal tensions.Before leaving, both Hussain and Mohamed had put their names to a letter criticising Sultana for failing to transfer an estimated £800,000 of Your Party donations held by a company she controls.The money is held by MoU Operations Ltd, which collected the initial waves of donations while Your Party was being formally registered.Sultana has transferred £600,000, promising any remaining money will be paid \"as soon as possible, as the legal details are ironed out\".Speaking on Saturday, Corbyn said: \"As a party, we've got to come together and be united, because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent.\"He also called for \"public, democratic ownership\" of the water industry, led a chant of \"free, free Palestine\" and urged party members to \"campaign forevermore for real socialism and real social justice\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoChancellor Rachel Reeves continues to face backlash over accusations she misled the public on the state of the nation's economy, with the story prominent on many of Sunday's papers. \"Reeves must go,\" is the consensus from voters who took part in a poll conducted by the Mail on Sunday. The paper reports that a majority of those who took part in the poll are in favour of Reeves quitting.The prime minister is also being drawn into the scandal, with the Sunday Telegraph saying Sir Keir Starmer was aware there was no black hole in public finances but still approved Reeves' speech about the need for tax rises in the Budget. The paper quotes No 10 saying the chancellor's speech was \"entirely accurate\", adding that the PM was aware of the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) figures and the \"content of the speech\".The Sunday Times keeps its focus on the PM, reporting that Sir Keir will vow to tackle the cost of living crisis next week in an attempt to pivot attention away from the embattled chancellor. The PM will pledge to scrap \"misguided\" regulations and root out unforeseen costs in the country's economy, the paper says.The Budget's impact on working families leads the Sunday Express. The paper cites a new report that says working families with three children will need to earn £71,000 to match the welfare benefits of a similar jobless household as a result of Reeves scrapping the two-child benefit cap.The Observer fills its front page with a black and white tribute to playwright Tom Stoppard, who has died aged 88. The paper also features a famous quote from Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead: \"Words, words. They're all we have to go on.\"The Independent shifts its attention to the war in Ukraine, spotlighting an interview with a Russia expert and former top White House adviser. Fiona Hill, a security adviser during Donald Trump's first administration, warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"manipulating\" the US leader and \"doesn't want peace\".Moving on to entertainment news, the Sunday Mirror previews an interview with I'm a Celebrity contestant Alex Scott. Scott told the paper of her concern when her partner, singer Jess Glynne, wasn't there to meet her when she was voted out of the Jungle. Glynne's mother had suffered a stroke and required urgent surgery.In other TV news, hit BBC crime drama This City has been struck by real-life criminals, the Daily Star reports. The paper says a crew member had his room ransacked and personal belongings stolen while the series was filming its second series in Spain.Finally, the Sun splashes its front page with an interview with TV personality Freddy Brazier's former partner. Holly Swinburn details their troubled relationship, telling the paper: \"Enough is enough, I don't' know if he can change.\"The fallout from Wednesday's Budget continues to dominate the newspapers. The Sunday Times tells its readers the prime minister will \"intervene\" to \"shore up his chancellor\", who it says is \"engulfed\" in a damaging row about whether she was honest with voters about the state of the economy.The Mail on Sunday says Rachel Reeves must resign for \"lying\", referring to accusations she knew the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast on the economy was better than originally thought when she unveiled her financial plans.The Sunday Telegraph asserts that Sir Keir signed off the chancellor's speech, which it describes as \"black hole lies\" and declares that Reeves's career is \"on the brink\" and she \"could take Starmer down with her\". In response, Downing Street said Reeves' comments were \"entirely accurate\" and that the prime minister was \"aware of the speech\" and the OBR's figures.Details of a Centre for Social Justice report are highlighted by the Sunday Express. It says families with three children need to earn £71,000 to bring in as much money as a similar household living on benefits. The think tank is quoted as warning that Britain is in a \"welfare crisis\" because of what it calls Reeves's \"benefit Budget\". The government said it delivered a budget that cut debt, borrowing and the cost of living.The Sunday Times carries an interview with a worshipper who was accidentally shot by police as he barricaded the doors at Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester to try to stop an attacker getting inside. Yoni Finlay is credited with saving \"countless\" lives last month. He tells the paper of the \"huge amount of guilt\" that he survived and how he is considering moving to Israel to keep his children safe because there is 'so much hate' in the UK.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, says his country has a chance to embrace political change after a peace deal is signed. Tipped as a future president, he also says Ukraine needs to rid itself of corruption and bring in reforms to prosper when the war is over.And the death of the acclaimed playwright Sir Tom Stoppard features in many of the papers, with the Observer devoting its entire front page to a picture of him as a young man along with the phrase: \"Words, words. They're all we have to go on.\" The paper says he will be remembered for \"his wit, irreverence and generosity of spirit\".Related Internet Links",

Fifty patients and their immediate family members are now receiving care in surroundings that are safe and welcoming.\"In October the prince unveiled a global memorial for humanitarian aid workers where he delivered a speech on humanitarian values.This royal visit signals further intent from Prince William to establish what he has called \"more empathetic leadership around the world\" where humanitarian issues are concerned.Speaking in a recent episode of the documentary series The Reluctant Traveller,  he told presenter Eugene Levy \"change is on my agenda, change for good\".\"Not overly radical change, but change that needs to happen,\" he added.After his visit to the Gazan children, a Palace spokesperson said: \"The Prince wished to offer a moment of comfort to these young people who have endured experiences no child should ever face. \"The Prince was also able to offer his heartfelt gratitude to the NHS teams providing exceptional care during such a profoundly difficult time.\"His Royal Highness was moved by the courage shown by the children and their families and by the dedication of the team who are supporting them with such professionalism and humanity.\"Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after Hamas-led militants based in the Palestinian territory attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251.At least 70,100 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire was called on 10 October.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to the Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

    "body": "Venezuela has angrily reacted to US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\". The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\". The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs, killing more than 80. It has not provided evidence and Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro says the US moves are an attempt to oust him. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.With Trump ratcheting up his threats, some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that he has not sought legislative approval.\"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.\"Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.Venezuela's foreign ministry urged \"the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression\", in a statement on Saturday. The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using \"violence to dominate\" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.",

    "body": "'One of our greatest writers': King leads tributes to Sir Tom Stoppard3 hours agoSeher Asaf,Patrick JacksonandYang TianPlaywright Sir Tom Stoppard dies at 88King Charles III and Queen Camilla have led tributes to famed playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, who died aged 88, hailing him as \"one of our greatest writers\".\"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history,\" they said.Sir Tom, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the screenplay for Shakespeare In Love, \"died peacefully at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family\", his agents said on Saturday.Tributes have poured in from around the world for the playwright who captivated audiences for more than six decades with work that explored philosophical and political themes.The King and Queen added they were \"deeply saddened\" by Sir Tom's death and sent their condolences to his family.\"We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: 'Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else'.\"The line is from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, one of his most notable stage works which also include The Real Thing.Paying tribute to his \"favourite playwright\", Sir Mick Jagger posted on social media: \"He leaves us with a majestic body of intellectual and amusing work. I will always miss him.\"Author Robert Harris, a friend of Sir Tom's, praised his talent and joy for life.\"He lived one of the most enviable lives I can think of. He was immensely talented, he was a very happy man, very witty and he enjoyed life. He came to lunch here in the summer and he was still smoking and indeed he was making notes in the summer for writing,\" the Times reported.Australian-British author of the 1979 novel Puberty Blues, Kathy Lette, remembered Sir Tom as \"one of the wittiest people I ever met\".Sharing a picture of them on social media, she wrote: \"A conversation with him left you reeling from irreverent & imaginative quip-lash.\"Sir Tom received many honours and accolades throughout his career, including being knighted by the late Queen for his services to literature in 1997.He also wrote for film, TV and radio. He adapted Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina for the 2012 film starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law.In 2020, he released his semi-autobiographical new work titled Leopoldstadt - set in the Jewish quarter of early 20th Century Vienna - which later won him an Olivier award for best new play and scooped four Tony awards.Nicholas Hytner, who directed Stoppard's play The Hard Problem at the National Theatre in London 10 years ago, celebrated the playwright's \"astonishing generosity and curiosity about the work of others\".\"He was a great writer and a legendary host but those of us lucky enough to know him and work with him will remember him as an exceptional enhancer of the lives he touched,\" according to the Guardian.The Olivier Awards organisation, which recognise excellence in theatre, said West End theatres would dim their lights for two minutes at 19:00 BST on 2 December to remember the playwright.In a post on X, it said Sir Tom had won three Olivier Awards and five Tony awards - for Broadway theatre - as well as the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love.\"That recognition attests to the remarkable range and enduring impact of his work on both stage and screen,\" it said.Getty ImagesSir Tom Stoppard (R) with screenwriter Marc Norman hold their Oscars in 1999.Rupert Goold, artistic director of the Almeida Theatre, described Sir Tom as the \"most supportive, most generous man\" whose \"magic was present in everything he wrote\".Born Tomas Straussler in Czechoslovakia, his parents fled from imminent Nazi occupation when he was still a baby and went to Singapore, where his father died in a Japanese prison camp.He, his mother and brother had escaped ahead of the Japanese invasion and went first to Australia, later to India. There his mother met and married an Englishman, a Major Kenneth Stoppard, before moving to England.He later learned from relatives that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish, and that they had died in Nazi concentration camps.\"I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life,\" he said in US magazine Talk in 1999, as he reflected on returning to his birthplace Zlin in what is now the Czech Republic.Lyricist Sir Tim Rice said he \"was in awe of nearly everything\" Sir Tom did.\"He was able to mix intellectual arguments and philosophical thought with sheer wit and fun and that was apparent in Rosencrantz And Guildenstern, which was his first big success, and I remained very much in awe of him, but he also became a friend and I was very honoured to know him,\" he told BBC News.\"He's written at least half a dozen, probably twice that, plays that will live for a long, long time - however brilliant plays are, a lot of them don't last much beyond their era, but I think Tom Stoppard's will, no question.\"",

    "body": "Image source, ReutersImage caption, Hurricane Melissa left a trail of destruction in Jamaica before hitting CubaByDarren BettLead Weather PresenterThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season will probably be remembered mainly for Hurricane Melissa and the devastation it caused across Jamaica and Cuba.But it was also a season of stark contrasts, with periods of relative calm and bursts of intense activity.The season managed to generate three Category 5 hurricanes - only the second season on record where that has happened. But during the typical mid-September peak things turned \"remarkably\" quiet. Also notable, it was the first time since 2015 when no hurricane made landfall in the United States.Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, 2025 had more major hurricanes than an average seasonThe North Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from 1 June to 30 November. However, the vast majority of tropical storm and hurricane activity typically occurs during the August-October period, which is considered to be the peak.At the beginning of the year forecasters were predicting that 2025 would be an \"above average\" season. Overall, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) report that the season fell within the ranges they had predicted for named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes.This year there have been 13 named storms and five hurricanes, four of which strengthened to become major hurricanes.How active a hurricane season has been can also be assessed by looking at the Accumulated Cyclone Energy or ACE Index. This reflects the strength or wind speed of each storm and how long it will last. For 2025 the total ACE is 132.9, which would indicate an above normal or very active season. A quiet startThe 2025 season started with Tropical Storm Andrea on 23 June which was a short-lived storm that remained over open water in the Atlantic. At the end of the month Tropical Storm Barry formed in Mexico's Bay of Campeche and became the first to strike land, further up the coast near Tampico.It was closely followed by Tropical Storm Chantal that hit South Carolina on 6 July and brought up to 6 inches of rain and subsequent flash flooding to North Carolina.This turned out to be the only storm to make landfall in the US which is very unusual in any season. In fact the last time no hurricanes made landfall in the US was a decade ago.The first hurricane in 2025 didn't develop until mid-August. But when it did, it was a big one. Hurricane ErinImage source, ReutersImage caption, Hurricane Erin highlighted the dangers even distant hurricanes can pose to coastal communitiesHurricane Erin became a major Category 5 hurricane on 16 August with sustained winds of 160mph (257km/h). It passed near the Caribbean and skirted the US east coast. Although it did not make direct landfall it did produce dangerous rip currents and large surf which kept beaches closed and led to evacuations in some areas.  It was significant because it underwent an exceptionally rapid strengthening, going from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in about a day. It later turned out that Erin wasn't the only storm to undergo explosive intensification with both hurricanes Humberto and Melissa following suit to reach Category 5 status. This was only the second season on record with three Category 5 hurricanes.Where did all the storms go?What followed Erin was a \"quite remarkable\" quiet period in storm activity that coincided with the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. A report from Colorado State University (CSU) highlighted three factors that could have led to a marked reduction in storm activity. These included a lack of moisture in the atmosphere, increased vertical wind shear that rips storms apart destroying them and a lack of thunderstorms off the west coast of Africa – typically a tropical storm formation area.Forecasters suggested the lull in activity would be short-lived with a flurry of storms to come later in the season. And in due course two major hurricanes formed - Gabrielle and Humberto. The track of these storms were affected by an area of high pressure known as the \"Bermuda high\". The high was weaker and displaced further east which resulted in both hurricanes being steered towards Bermuda and the mid-Atlantic rather than towards Florida, normally one of the hardest hit states during hurricane season.Hurricane MelissaImage source, NOAAImage caption, Hurricane Melissa bears down on JamaicaUp until this point it had been a quiet year for the Caribbean. But that changed late in October when Tropical Storm Melissa, to the south of Jamaica, strengthened to a category 4 hurricane within 24 hours, fuelled by unusually warm waters in the region.After becoming slow-moving and bringing several days of damaging winds and flooding rains, Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on 28 October as a major category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 185mph (297km/h).Most years the island will feel the impacts of two or three tropical storms or hurricanes but only three hurricanes have directly hit the country since 1988. Hurricane Melissa was the strongest storm ever to hit Jamaica and tied for the strongest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic basin.Melissa went on the make a second landfall in eastern Cuba still as a major hurricane and brought widespread damage and flooding.Melissa brought an abrupt but catastrophic end to the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season with no storms forming in November.Role of climate changeA World Weather Attribution study has found that the atmospheric and ocean conditions that led to the rapid intensification of Hurricane Melissa were made six times more likely by climate change. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide but warmer oceans, coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense.The frequency and magnitude of \"rapid intensification events\" in the Atlantic is also likely to have increased. This is where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly, as we saw with Erin and Melissa.The speed of movement of storms seems to be slowing down too with the potential to give more rainfall, as we also saw with Hurricane Melissa.",

    "body": "35 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, with hundreds still missingHundreds are dead and missing in South East Asia, where some of the heaviest rain in decades has swept the region.Monsoons exacerbated by tropical storms has caused some of the worst flooding in years, with millions affected in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.The death toll on Indonesia's Sumatra island has passed 300 and there are fears this could increase further as dozens remain missing.Evacuation efforts are still under way there, with major roads cut off, and internet and electricity only partially restored.Officials said on Sunday that the death toll in Thailand had risen to 170. There were also several deaths reported in Malaysia.Elsewhere, there have been nearly 160 deaths in Sri Lanka due to a bout of particularly extreme weather that has caused flooding and mudslides.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsAn exceptionally rare tropical storm, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Indonesia's Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.\"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told news agency Reuters. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.In Tapanuli, the worst-affected area, residents have reportedly ransacked shops in search of food. Pressure is mounting on Jakarta to declare a national disaster in Sumatra to enable a faster and more co-ordinated response.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia, hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 3.8 million people have been affected, the government said on Saturday.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day last week - the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, workers were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that had lost family members. Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of northern Perlis state underwater, with two people dead and tens of thousands forced into shelters.Elsewhere in Asia, Sri Lanka has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, with 159 people killed and more than 200 missing, according to the Disaster Management Centre.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters of recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto - which has crossed over the Philippines and is now heading towards Vietnam - and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.Three people have already been killed and another is missing in Vietnam due to the effects of the approaching Typhoon Koto, news agency AFP reports.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.While it is hard to link individual extreme weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making storms more frequent and intense, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.More on this story",

    "body": "South Africa head coach Rassie Erasmus admitted \"the optics weren't great\" after legendary lock Eben Etzebeth was sent off for an eye gouge against Wales.The Springboks completed an autumn clean sweep by going on the rampage in Cardiff to score 11 tries in a 73-0 win.Yet almost the final act of the international year was Etzebeth, who went over for the final score, being dismissed by referee Luc Ramos.The 34-year-old was shown a red card for making contact with the left eye of Wales flanker Alex Mann with his thumb in a 79th-minute scuffle.\"I don't know what I can say that won't be controversial. It didn't look good and it was a justified red card,\" said Erasmus.\"How it happened and why it happened, and if he was provoked, I am not sure, but it's definitely not the way that we would have liked to end the game. I don't think that the optics were great.\"Etzebeth, who extended his Springboks record when winning a 141st cap in Cardiff, looks certain to be given a lengthy ban.His Sharks team start their Champions Cup campaign at Toulouse on Sunday, 7 December before a home game against Saracens and South African derbies over the festive period.The world champions overpowered Wales in a fixture that was one-sided from the off.Steve Tandy's reign has started with three heavy autumn defeats to South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina and a last-gasp win against Japan.Wales have lost 21 of their last 23 Test matches yet Erasmus tried to offer some comfort.\"I feel that we have been building and building up, this was a controlled performance,\" he said.\"The Welsh are not guys that just roll over and take the shots, they fight until the end. This was one of the really clinical performances and us putting our soul out on the game.\"Wales have a great coach and will come back. We know it can change and in 1998 we beat them (96-13) and then lost in 1999.\"South Africa finish the year as the number one side in the world after winning back-to-back Rugby Championship titles.The Springboks have showcased their formidable depth and power yet Erasmus pointed to when they were ranked sixth.\"We were in that situation and people were burning jerseys, but the Welsh people are here,\" he said.\"There is the support and the players have the fight. Get one or two wins, get on a roll and things will change.\"I know that things changed from 2016, when we were nowhere, to 2019 when we won the World Cup. Anything is possible.\"",

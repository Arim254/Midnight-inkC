Pochin says “My comments were phrased poorly and I apologise for any offence caused, which was not my intention.”\nAnd we look at Laura’s interview with Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris, in which said said she was 'concerned' she did not ask Biden to quit the presidential race.\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

    "body": "Singer Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau appear to have confirmed their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris. Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau is seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for weeks with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau  was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday over the weekend and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Representatives for Perry and Trudeau's Liberal party did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.  After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

The decision comes after Dutch grid operator TenneT terminated a major offshore wind contract with Petrofac, scuppering a planned financial restructuring.The firm, which has UK offices in Aberdeen, London, Woking and Great Yarmouth, said further information on the administration process would be provided in due course.Getty ImagesPetrofac is a contractor for oil and gas producers in the North Sea Founded in Texas in 1981, Petrofac designs and builds facilities for oil, gas and renewables projects, as well as providing engineering, project management and logistical services. It has been involved in the operation of North Sea oil platforms for firms including BP and Shell.Once a FTSE 100 firm, the company was worth around £6bn at its peak in 2012 but it has slumped in recent years following a Serious Fraud Office investigation and a series of profit warnings.Petrofac was worth around £20m when its shares were suspended in May. The firm has cited delays in contract payments and rising operating costs.'Worrying time' The Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the announcement, which it said came at an \"already worrying time for the North Sea supply chain\". Chie executive Russell Borthwick said: \"Thousands of skilled jobs across the region depend on companies like Petrofac, which sit at the heart of both our oil and gas and energy transition sectors.\"While many of Petrofac's challenges predate the current government, this is another stark reminder that the UK government must urgently act to restore confidence and stability in the energy industry.\"A spokesperson for the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero said the UK arm of Petrofac \"is continuing to operate as normal, as an in-demand business with a highly-skilled workforce and many successful contracts\".They said the administration process was a result of \"long-standing issues\" in the firm's worldwide operations. The spokesperson added: \"The government will continue to work with the UK company as it focuses on its long-term future.\"",

    "body": "Argentina's Milei wins big in midterms with 'chainsaw' austerity3 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent in Buenos AiresAFP via Getty ImagesJavier Milei won nearly 41% of the vote in Argentina's midterm electionsArgentina's President Javier Milei has led his party to a landslide victory in Sunday's midterm elections, after defining the first two years of his presidency with radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.His party, La Libertad Avanza, won nearly 41% of the vote, taking 13 of 24 Senate seats and 64 of the 127 lower-house seats that were contested.His gains will make it easier for Milei to push ahead with his programme to slash state spending and deregulate the economy.President Donald Trump congratulated Milei on social media, saying: \"He's making us all look good.\" Before the vote, Trump made it clear a $40bn US lifeline for Argentina would depend on Milei keeping political momentum.Milei's supporters welcomed that, though critics accused Trump of foreign interference in Argentina's elections.In a nod to his North American ally, Milei told cheering supporters: \"We must consolidate the path of reform we have embarked upon to turn Argentina's history around once and for all… to make Argentina great again.\"Before these elections his party had just seven Senate seats and 37 seats in the lower house.That meant his programme of spending cuts and reforms faced various political obstacles.His vetoes of bills to boost funding for state universities, people with disabilities and children's healthcare were all overturned by opposition lawmakers.After Sunday's result, hundreds of his supporters gathered, cheering, outside a hotel in Buenos Aires where he was watching the result.\"Milei didn't have 15% of Congress in his favour. Now, with many more deputies and senators, he'll be able to change the country in a year,\" one young voter called Dionisio said.\"Our province was devastated by previous governments,\" another voter, Ezequiel, said.\"Now, thank God, freedom has won. We want our daughter to grow up in this beautiful country. What happened in previous years is regrettable.\"Getty ImagesHundreds of Milei's supporters gathered in the streets to celebrate the election resultThese elections were the first national test of President Milei's popularity since he took office in 2023, pledging to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to it. He brandished a real one during his campaign rallies.He's since cut budgets for education, pensions, health, infrastructure, and subsidies, and laid off tens of thousands of public sector workers.Supporters, including Trump, hail him for taming inflation - which hit triple figures annually before he took office - cutting the deficit, and restoring investor confidence.His critics, though, argue the price has been job losses, a decline in manufacturing, crumbling public services, a fall in people's purchasing power and an imminent recession.Juliana, who works with children with disabilities in Tucumán province, is concerned that a law to increase funding for people with disabilities - which Milei vetoed, before being overturned - could be \"in danger\" with the president's position strengthened in Congress.\"Our salaries are low, it remains the same, while other things are increasing. We still don't see a change,\" she added.Veronica, a retired police officer, has been hit by Milei's pension cuts.\"You see a lot of poverty,\" she said. \"It's very hard: for retirees, for people with children with disabilities, for young people. There's a lot of unemployment. Many factories have closed.\"Juliana (L) and Veronica (R) are concerned about possible spending cuts Milei has also kept inflation down by propping up the peso, leaving it overvalued and draining reserves ahead of $20bn of debt repayments next year.This had caused alarm that Argentina could be hurtling towards an economic crisis.That, coupled with a poor election result in Buenos Aires province in September, spooked the financial markets that Milei's cost-cutting agenda may not be politically sustainable.These factors prompted the US to step in to help. It has now offered Argentina a potential $40bn lifeline via the combination of a currency swap, buying pesos and arranging private investment.\"If he wins, we're staying with him. If he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Trump had threatened.Before this election, doubts had grown about Milei's political future due to some voters tiring of his austerity programme, as well as a series of corruption scandals that had rocked his party.This election turnout was 67.9%, the lowest in a national election in decades, representing widespread apathy with politicians of all stripes.Some voters backed him reluctantly.\"Milei has two years left and should try to do what he can,\" said Dardo, a business owner in Buenos Aires. \"I think we're on the right path, but the middle and working classes are suffering too much.\"He is sceptical the support from the US will help, saying \"we're going to have to pay for it at some point\".Others, like political science student Thiago, said they understood the need for fiscal balance but questioned Milei's means.\"There's a lack of investment in hospitals, infrastructure, in people with disabilities,\" he said. \"There's a certain false hope.\"This election result, though, shows that many Argentines remain unwilling to return to the Peronist model Milei blames for decades of economic mismanagement. Getty ImagesMilei's took office in 2023 with a pledge to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to it\"Argentines showed that they do not want to return to the failed model, the model of inflation… the model of a useless state,\" he declared.Financial markets are expected to rally after the win: a sign that, for now, Milei's political survival has also kept his economic experiment alive - and US support in place.His new mandate gives him the power to implement more radical changes ahead of the next presidential election in 2027, when his name could be on the ballot once more.The question now is whether ordinary voters start feeling better off, or if the pain of some of his cuts tests people's patience once more.For now, it appears a significant proportion of voters are – once again – prepared to give him time.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,Africa correspondent and Richard Kagoe,Africa editor, BBC World ServiceThe UN has called for safe passage for trapped civilians out of the Sudanese city of el-Fasher after paramilitary fighters announced they had seized control of the army's main base there. Sudan's military has not acknowledged loss of the site, which would be a significant victory for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the ongoing civil war. UN chief Antonio Guterres said the latest fighting marked a \"terrible escalation\" in the conflict, adding that the suffering of civilians was \"unbearable\", AFP news agency reports.El-Fasher is the last army foothold in the vast western region of Darfur, and has been besieged by the RSF and its allies for 18 months.Heavy fighting has been reported since Saturday after RSF fighters captured the home of the North Darfur governor.Social media videos verified by the BBC now show RSF combatants celebrating the capture of the army's el-Fasher headquarters.They claim to have seized full control of el-Fasher, but the army's local allies say fighting continues in parts of the city. The group has been accused of targeting civilians in airstrikes and trapping nearly 250,000 people after encircling the city with an earth wall, leaving many on the brink of starvation.The city is one of the worst battlegrounds of Sudan's civil war, leading the UN to  call it an \"epicentre of suffering\". The UN's top humanitarian official Tom Fletcher said he was deeply alarmed at the reports of civilian casualties. \"With fighters pushing further into the city and escape routes cut off, hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped and terrified - shelled, starving, and without access to food, healthcare, or safety,\" Fletcher said in a statement.\"Civilians must be allowed safe passage and be able to access aid,\" he added.The US has also called for safe passage and is trying to negotiate a ceasefire.Taking el-Fasher would be a crucial comeback for the RSF after defeat in Khartoum. But it is likely a sign that the civil war will continue, not end.Sudan has been ravaged by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued.More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east, with el-Fasher being until now the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies.The RSF controls almost all of Darfur and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region.The group has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in al-Fasher when it assumes complete control.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty, Damian Zane, Danai Nesta Kupemba and Peter Mwai",

    "body": "3 hours agoOttilie Mitchell and Henry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentThe Home Office has \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation, according to a report by a committee of MPs.The Home Affairs Committee said \"flawed contracts\" and \"incompetent delivery\" left the department unable to cope with a surge in demand and it relied on hotels as \"go-to solutions\" instead of temporary stop-gaps.The MPs said expected costs had tripled to more than £15bn and not enough had been done to recoup excess profits.A Home Office spokesperson said the government was \"furious about the number of illegal migrants in this country and in hotels\", and reiterated its pledge to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.Just under 103,000 asylum seekers are being housed by the government, of which just over 32,000, around a third, are accommodated in 210 hotels.Asylum accommodation is currently delivered through a series of large-scale, regional contracts agreed by the previous government with a number of private providers, which started in 2019 and will expire in 2029.They allow for the use of \"contingency accommodation\" - usually hotels - when demand exceeds supply, but state that these should only be used on a short-term basis.The report said the current system for housing people seeking asylum - with its reliance on hotels - was expensive, unpopular with local communities and unsuitable for the asylum seekers themselves.The report said the contracts drawn up for accommodation providers under the Conservatives had been flawed and that \"inadequate oversight\" had meant failings went \"unnoticed and unaddressed\".Expected costs for hotel contracts from 2019-2029 have risen from £4.5bn to £15.3bn, while two accommodation providers still owe millions in excess profits that the Home Office has not recovered, the report found.The report said the department neglected its day-to-day management of the contracts, and had not sufficiently ordered financial penalties for providers who have poor performance.This includes no fines for failures at hotels and the larger accommodation sites, while excess profits from providers are yet to be reclaimed.The committee said the money should be used on public services, \"not sitting in the bank accounts of private businesses\".There are few issues more sensitive for this government than its management of the asylum system.While ministers have set a deadline for ending the use of asylum hotels by the next general election, most likely 2029, they want to show progress in reducing the numbers long before then.Labour officials are especially anxious about how hotels can become a rallying point for frustration in different communities across the country.The specific criticism of the Home Office is also the latest reminder of how many government controversies emanate from that department, following rows only in the last week over the grooming gangs inquiry, the collapse of the prosecution of two men accused of spying for China, and the return of a migrant deported to France under the 'one in one out' scheme.External factors, including the pandemic and the \"dramatic\" increase in small boat arrivals, have meant the Home Office has had to accommodate \"a growing number of people for longer periods of time\" the MPs' report said. Choices made by the previous Conservative government, including to delay asylum decisions as it pursued the scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda, factored into this, MPs added.While the report acknowledged the \"challenging environment\" in which the Home Office was operating, it said \"its chaotic response has demonstrated that it has not been up to the challenge\".Chair of the committee Dame Karen Bradley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We just ended up with more people than the contracts ever thought there could be and that's meant that the costs have absolutely rocketed.\"\"The government has only just started looking at claiming back those profits, auditing the accounts to see what is due back to the taxpayer,\" Dame Karen said.The said \"failures of leadership at a senior level\" were among reasons the Home Office was \"incapable of getting a grip on the situation\".Dame Karen said the department had \"neglected the day-to-day management of these contracts\" and has focused on \"short term, reactive responses\".\"The skills needed to manage these contracts simply were not present in the Home Office when they were drawn up,\" she added.Housing Secretary Steve Reed accused the previous government of \"pouring taxpayers' money down the drain\".He added that Labour ministers were continuing to look at housing asylum seekers on disused military bases, with an announcement \"within weeks\".He added that while the government was also looking at longer-term rental accommodation options, military sites represented the \"least expensive option available\" to house asylum seekers. Two former military sites - MDP Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, and Napier Barracks, a former military base in Kent - are already being used to house asylum seekers after being opened under the Conservatives.Dame Karen welcomed the government's pledge to shift away from asylum hotels and invest in larger sites like military bases.But she said past failings, like moving people into accommodation too quickly, must not be repeated.In response to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have already taken action - closing hotels, slashing asylum costs by nearly £1bn and exploring the use of military bases and disused properties.\"Several protests and counter-protests over asylum hotels have taken place across the UK this year, notably in Epping over the summer after an asylum seeker being housed at The Bell Hotel was charged with two sexual assaults.",

They returned exhausted but delighted. Mission accomplished.\"Bravery was found guilty of attempted murder in 2020 following a trial at the Old Bailey.He was handed a life sentence and told he would serve a minimum of 15 years in prison.More on this story",

    "body": "28 minutes agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesTen people accused of sexist cyber-bullying of the French president's wife, Brigitte Macron, are due to go on trial this week in Paris.The defendants are accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between Brigitte and her husband, Emmanuel Macron.If found guilty, the defendants face up to two years' imprisonment.Among the ten people due to appear in the dock on Monday and Tuesday are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher, according to French media.Two of them - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name.But a court of appeals later acquitted Rey and Roy on the grounds that their statements did not constitute defamation. Mrs Macron and her brother are appealing the decision.A conspiracy theory centred around the notion that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has been swirling since her husband won a first term in office in 2017.The unsubstantiated claims over Mrs Macron's gender have been gaining ground in the US, mostly promoted by right-wing influencer Candace Owens.Last July the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Owens, alleging that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said that Brigitte Macron had found the claims \"incredibly upsetting\" and they were a \"distraction\" to the French president.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Emmanuel Macron has said pursuing legal action against Owens was about \"defending his honour\" and that the influencer had peddled false information \"with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\"Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school. The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

The strike at the US carmaker's 10 Swedish service centres has now reached its second anniversary, and there is little prospect of a resolution.Janis Kuzma has been on the Tesla picket line since October 2023.\"It's a tough time,\" says the 39-year-old. And as Sweden's cold winter weather sets in, it's likely to become tougher.Janis spends each Monday with a colleague, standing outside a Tesla garage on an industrial park in Malmö. His union, IF Metall, provides accommodation in the form of a mobile builders' van, as well as coffee and sandwiches.But it's business as usual across the road, where the workshop appears to be in full swing.The strike concerns an issue that goes to the heart of Swedish industrial culture - the right of trade unions to negotiate pay and conditions on behalf of their members. This concept of collective agreement has underpinned industrial relations in Sweden for nearly a century.Janis Kuzma says that the ongoing strike has not been easyToday some 70% of Swedish workers are members of a trade union, and 90% are covered by a collective agreement. Strikes in Sweden are rare.It's an arrangement welcomed across the board. \"We prefer the right to negotiate freely with the unions and sign collective agreements,\" says Mattias Dahl of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise business organisation.But Tesla has upset the apple cart.  Outspoken chief executive Elon Musk has said he \"disagrees\" with the idea of unions. \"I just don't like anything which creates a kind of lords and peasants sort of thing,\" he told an audience in New York in 2023. \"I think the unions try to create negativity in a company.\"Tesla came to Sweden back in 2014, and IF Metall has long wanted to secure a collective agreement with the company.\"But they wouldn't respond,\" says Marie Nilsson, the union's president.  \"And we got the impression that they tried to hide away or not discuss this with us.\"She says the union eventually saw no other option than to announce a strike, which started on 27 October, 2023. \"Usually it's enough to make the threat,\" says Ms Nilsson. \"The company usually signs the agreement.\"But not in this case.Union boss Marie Nilsson says that the industrial action was the last optionJanis Kuzma, who is originally from Latvia, started working for Tesla in 2021. He claims that pay and conditions were often dependent on the whim of managers.He recalls a performance review at which he says he was refused an annual pay rise because he was \"not reaching Tesla's goals\". Meanwhile, a colleague was said to have been turned down for a pay rise because he had the \"wrong attitude\".However, not everyone went out on strike. Tesla had some 130 mechanics working at the time the industrial action was called. IF Metall says that today around 70 of its members are on strike.Tesla has long since replaced these with new workers, for which there is no precedent since the 1930s.\"Tesla has done it [found replacement staff] openly and systematically,\" says German Bender, a researcher at Arena Idé, a think tank financed by Swedish trade unions.\"It's not illegal, which is important to understand. But it goes against all established norms. But Tesla doesn't care about norms.\"They want to be norm breakers. So if somebody tells them, hey, you are breaking a norm, they see that as a compliment.\"The BBC asked to speak to Tesla's subsidiary, TM Sweden, but the request was declined in an email citing \"all-time high deliveries\".Indeed, the company has given only one media interview in the two years since the strike began.In March 2024, TM Sweden's \"country lead\", Jens Stark, told the business paper Dagens Industri that it suited the company better not to have a collective agreement, and instead \"to work closely with the team and give them the best possible conditions\".Mr Stark denied that the decision not to enter a collective agreement was one made at Tesla headquarter in the US. \"We have a mandate to make our own such decisions,\" he said.IF Metall is not entirely alone in its fight. The strike has been supported by a number of other unions.Dockworkers in neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland, are refusing to handle Teslas; rubbish is no longer collected from Tesla's Swedish facilities; and newly built charging stations are not being connected to the grid in the country.There is one such facility near Stockholm Arlanda Airport, where 20 chargers stand idle. But Tibor Blomhäll, the president of enthusiasts group Tesla Club Sweden, says Tesla owners are unaffected by the strike.\"There's another charging station 10km (six miles) from here,\" he says. \"And we can still buy our cars, we can service our cars, we can charge our cars.\"AFP via Getty ImagesDespite the strike Tesla's cars remain popular in SwedenWith stakes high on both sides, it's hard to see an end to the stand-off. IF Metall risks setting a precedent if it concedes the principle of collective agreement.\"The concern is that that would spread,\" says Mr Bender, \"and eventually erode the strong support for the labour market model that we have among employers as well\".Tesla, on the other hand, may feel that conceding this fight in Sweden would strengthen the hand of those who want to unionise Tesla at its production facilities in the US and Germany, where it employs tens of thousands of staff.Mr Bender detects another reason for the position Tesla has taken. \"I think it's important to understand that Elon Musk doesn't want to be sort of told how to do things,\" he says.\"And I think he doesn't view the industrial action that the union has taken as an invitation to negotiate, but rather as an ultimatum to sign a dotted line that he doesn't want to sign.\"Mr Blomhäll of Tesla Club Sweden also says he sees no quick solution. \"This will be another Korean War,\" he says. \"A conflict that just drags on.\"Read more global business stories",

    "body": "Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson said he narrowly avoided a fatal accident during Sunday's Mexico City Grand Prix after two marshals ran across the track in front of him.The incident happened in the third lap when marshals were seen on the circuit as Lawson rejoined the race after an early pitstop to replace a front wing.Shortly afterwards, Racing Bulls driver Lawson said on team radio to his race engineer: \"Are you kidding me? Did you just see that? I could have... killed them.\"After the race, he added: \"I honestly couldn't believe what I was seeing.\"[I] came out on a new set of hards [tyres], and then I got to Turn One and there were just two dudes running across the track.\"I nearly hit one of them, honestly, it was so dangerous.\"Obviously there's been a miscommunication somewhere but I've never experienced that before, and I haven't really seen that in the past. It's pretty unacceptable.\"We can't understand how on a live track marshals can be allowed to just run across the track like that. I have no idea why, I'm sure we'll get some sort of explanation, but it really can't happen again.\"Formula 1's governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), is investigating the circumstances.\"Following a turn one incident, race control was informed that debris was present on the track at the apex of that corner,\" said the FIA.\"On lap three, marshals were alerted and placed on standby to enter the track and recover the debris once all cars had passed.\"As soon as it became apparent that Lawson had pitted, the instructions to dispatch marshals were rescinded and a double yellow flag was shown in that area. \"We are still investigating what occurred after that point.\"",

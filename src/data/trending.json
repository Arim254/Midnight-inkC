The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "2 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersEmergency services attended the scene after three further bodies were found on 9 FebruarySix people have been found dead in suspected murder-suicides in a mountain range in western Bulgaria, officials have said.Three bodies, including that of a 15 year old, were found in a van parked in a remote area of Stara Planina on Sunday. Investigators said they were connected to three others found dead near a burned-down hut six days prior.Officers said CCTV footage showed the two groups saying goodbye to each other at the hut, with the three who remained at the scene later filmed setting it on fire.Bulgaria's acting prosecutor general Borislav Sarafov said the case contained \"more shocking details\" than Twin Peaks - the drama about a murder investigation in a US logging town.Prosecutors have said the deaths were likely murder-suicides or suicides - sparking fevered speculation in the country and criticism of the investigation.The national police chief branded the case an \"unprecedented crime\" unlike any other seen before in the country.The first three men - aged 45, 49 and 51 - were found dead near a burned-down hut on 2 February, local media reported citing Bulgaria's interior ministry. All had gunshot wounds and there were \"no signs of a struggle\" or further trauma, Natalia Nikolova from the Appeal Prosecutor's Office in Sofia told reporters on Monday. Forensic experts determined that shots had been fired from close range. According to the Reuters news agency, two handguns and a rifle were found at the scene near the Petrohan mountain pass, about an hour's distance from the capital Sofia.Six days later, officers found two men and a 15-year-old boy dead in a parked camper van near Mount Okolchista.\"The individuals are connected to the Petrohan case,\" national police chief Zahari Vaskov told reporters.He said they had wounds from shots which appeared to have been fired inside the vehicle. Prosecutors later said autopsies indicated there had likely been two murders and one suicide.Most of the victims belonged to a nature protection NGO, officials said.

Rebecca Mundy, deputy chief crown prosecutor, said the CPS had worked closely with Essex Police to examine and review material obtained during previous investigations. \"We have established that there is sufficient evidence to charge 12 people with the offence of manslaughter and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings,\" she said. Mundy warned people about the risks of commenting about the case online. \"The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that proceedings against the defendants are now active and that they have a right to a fair trial,\" she said. \"It is vital that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in anyway prejudice these proceedings.\"The 12 men charged with manslaughter are:Greg Allen, 37, of Westcliff-on-Sea, EssexRyan Carter, 30, of HMP The MountJamie Chambers, 33, of Southend-on-Sea, EssexLewis Courtnell, 43, of Leigh-on-Sea, EssexPhilip McGill, 40, of Westcliff-on-Sea, EssexScott Nicholls, 49, of Basildon, EssexMatthew Petchey, 35, of Rochford, EssexRhys Pullen, 29, of Maldon, EssexThomas Randall, 31, of Leigh-on-SeaMichael Shawyer, 40, of Leigh-on-SeaAlexander Woods, 33, of Westcliff-on-SeaJames Woods, 33, of Nawton, YorkDet Supt Stephen Jennings of Essex Police said it was a \"significant milestone in an extremely complicated investigation\".\"Simon's case is one that has evoked a great deal of emotion, but I would ask people to be mindful about commentary to ensure those charged are able to have a fair trial,\" he added.

    "body": "2 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAn 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home. Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman. \"I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,\" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said. The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13. Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.Van Rootselaar previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago. Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said. Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting. Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital. Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers \"bore witness to unheard of cruelty\" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital \"fighting for their lives\".Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told CBC that the community is small and tight-knit, and that he expected the victims to all be people he knows.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" he said, after emerging from the town hall when the shelter-in-place order was lifted.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesOatly can no longer refer to its plant-based drinks as 'oat milk'Plant-based drink maker Oatly has lost a long-running legal battle over its use of the word \"milk\" in its marketing.The Swedish company tried to trademark the slogan \"post-milk generation\" in the UK in 2021 but Dairy UK, the representative body for British dairy farmers, objected.Following rulings in several courts, the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday said Oatly could neither trademark nor use the phrase \"post-milk generation\".The long-running dispute has centred on Dairy UK's argument that, under trademark law, the term \"milk\" can only be used to refer to products that come from an animal.The Supreme Court ruled the phrase \"post-milk generation\" could confuse people over whether Oatly's products are completely milk-free or merely have a low milk content.Oatly's general manager for the UK and Ireland, Bryan Carroll, said the case was \"a way to stifle competition and is not in the interests of the British public\".\"This decision creates unnecessary confusion and an uneven playing field for plant-based products that solely benefits Big Dairy.\"Because the relevant law only applies to food products, Oatly is still allowed to sell t-shirts bearing the slogan \"post-milk generation\" which it had made before the ensuing legal battle.In November 2021, Dairy UK appealed to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) not to let the company trademark the phrase. The IPO rejected Oatly's application to trademark the phrase.The firm took the decision to the High Court, which ruled that the IPO was wrong to conclude that consumers would be confused by the phrase.But the Court of Appeal ruled in December 2024 that the term \"milk\" can only be used to describe animal products.Following the ruling, Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK said the body was \"delighted\". The ruling, she said, \"helps ensure that long-established dairy terms continue to carry clear meaning for consumers\".Last year, the EU parliament voted to ban the use of terms such as \"oat milk\" and \"veggie burger\" — but such a ban will not come into force until it is backed by the European Commission and all 27 member states.European farmers have argued such terms mislead consumers and threaten their industry.Environmentalists have said that the ban will harm sustainability efforts and is an overreach by the meat and dairy industries.Richard May, partner at law firm Osborne Clarke, said of the Supreme Court ruling: \"It confirms that, even post-Brexit, the UK will continue to take a strict approach to the use of protected dairy terms, closely aligned with the EU regime.\"The key principle is straightforward: if a product is not derived from animal milk, it cannot be marketed using reserved dairy designations such as 'milk' or 'cheese'.\"Companies like Oatly will now likely limit their use of terms like \"dairy-free\" to \"factual\" information, rather than branding and marketing, May said.",

    "body": "7 hours agoRobert GreenallandGabriela PomeroyTrent ErnstThe shootings have sent shock waves through the small townPeople in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home. Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.Bryan Castellarin told the BBC his 15-year-old son Ashton was there while the shooting took place.Ashton and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off,\" Castellarin said.\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.Some of the students were \"really freaking out and crying,\" Bryan said. \"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.\"Ashton told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\"I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,\" Bryan said.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Norbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "7 minutes agoKali Hays,Technology reporterandRegan Morris and Peter Bowes,Courthouse in Los Angeles ReutersThe head of Instagram has defended his platform against claims it caused mental health damage to minors, arguing in a California court that even seemingly excessive use of social media does not equal an addiction.Adam Mosseri, who has led Instagram for eight years, testified in the landmark trial that began this week in Los Angeles, making him the first high-profile executive to appear. It is expected to last six weeks, and serve as a test of legal arguments aimed at holding tech firms accountable for impacts on young people.Lawyers for Meta, which owns Instagram, have argued the lead plaintiff in the case, known by her initials K.G.M, was hurt by other things in her life, not Instagram.YouTube is also named in the suit, while Snapchat and TikTok both reached settlements ahead of the trial. One of the top executives at Meta, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, Mosseri is expected to be questioned in court all day on Wednesday. Early on in his testimony, he agreed on a broad point made by Mark Lanier, the lead attorney for K.G.M, that Instagram should do everything within its power to help keep users safe on the platform, especially young people.However, Mosseri said he did not think it was possible to say how much Instagram use was too much.Whether use was a problem was \"a personal thing,\" Mosseri said, explaining that one person could use Instagram \"more than you and feel good about it.\"\"It's important to differentiate between clinical addiction and problematic use,\" he added. \"I'm sure I've said that I've been addicted to a Netflix show when I binged it really late one night, but I don't think it's the same thing as clinical addiction.\"Yet, Mosseri repeatedly said he was not an expert in addiction in response to Lanier's questioning.Lanier brought up with Mosseri an internal Meta survey in which the company asked 269,000 Instagram users about their experiences using the app and found 60% had seen or experienced bullying in the previous week.The lawyer added that K.G.M had made over 300 reports to Instagram about bullying on the platform, asking whether Mosseri had been aware of that fact. Mosseri said he had not known.Lanier asked Mosseri what he thought of K.G.M's longest single day of use of Instagram being 16 hours.\"That sounds like problematic use,\" the Instagram boss answered. He did not call it an addiction.  Mosseri was also asked about a 2019 email exchange between Meta executives, in which they discussed the potential negative impact for users caused by a feature allowing people to change their physical appearance in photos.Nick Clegg, who worked as Meta's head of global affairs for several years after more than a decade as a Member of Parliament, was among those to raise concern about the image filters.He said Meta would end up \"rightly accused of putting growth over responsibility,\" which would ultimately have a \"regressive\" impact on the company's reputation.Mosseri said the firm ultimately decided to ban image filters that went beyond mimicking the effects of makeup.After Lanier challenged that claim, Mosseri admitted that the ban on such filters had been \"modified\", while denying it had been lifted completely.Meta and other social media companies, including YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok, are facing thousands of other cases brought by their families, state prosecutors, and school districts across the United States.On his way in, Mosseri was met by a crowd of people outside the courthouse, a mix of onlookers, protestors and parents not involved in the lawsuit, who nevertheless claim to have seen their children suffer from what they say was addiction to social media.Mariano Janin, from London, is one such family member.Holding a photo of his daughter Mia, who died by suicide in 2021 when she was 14, Janin said he travelled to Los Angeles to witness the trial and show his support for the idea that social media use should be restricted for young users.\"If they changed their business model it would be different,\" Janin said. \"They should protect kids. They have the technology; they have the funds.\"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and Neal Mohan, chief executive of YouTube, are among the other high-profile figures expected to testify in the case.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHafsa KhalilAFP via Getty ImagesThe Metropolitan Police should interview Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and \"urgently\" re-examine its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's victims possibly being trafficked in and out of the UK, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said.In December, a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018, some with British women on board who say they were abused by Epstein.The BBC has approached Andrew for comment to Brown's article. He has previously denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.Brown said he had spent the last week looking at the Epstein files, the documents relating to the disgraced financier released by the US Department of Justice.\"What I discovered about the abuse of women by male predators and their enablers - and Britain's as yet unacknowledged role - has shocked me to the core,\" he said.\"It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all.\"Referring to the BBC investigation into Epstein's private planes arriving and departing from UK airports, he wrote that women \"were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\". A number of logs for his planes identified women on board only as unnamed \"females\".\"It seems the authorities never knew what was happening,\" he said, adding that many of the male passengers are unknown because their names were withheld.\"In short, British authorities had little or no idea who was being trafficked through our country, and for whom other than Epstein.\"Brown adds: \"I have asked the Met urgently to re-examine their decision-making in their investigation and the subsequent reviews. \"Even women who have been mentioned in the Epstein files, whose names should have been requested months ago from the US Department of Justice, do not appear to have been contacted by British investigators.\"\"I have been told privately that the investigations related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights. \"I have asked the police to look at this as part of the new inquiry.\"He added that Stansted Airport was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".\"The Stansted revelations alone require them to interview Andrew,\" Brown said.Last year, US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein's victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale UK investigation\" into his activities on the other side of the Atlantic.One of the British woman who testified against Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell - who is known as Kate - was listed as having been on more than 10 flights paid for by Epstein in and out of the UK between 1999 and 2006.Her lawyer Brad Edwards told the BBC she has never been contacted by UK police.\"A UK police investigation into Kate's plight could reveal Epstein's enablers in Britain, and might also discover whether his friends protected him from a UK investigation,\" Brown said.On Wednesday, police in the UK said they were continuing to assess allegations of Epstein having sent a second woman to the UK for sex with Andrew in Windsor in 2010.\"We are assessing the information and following established procedures to seek further information with law enforcement partners in the United States,\" a Thames Valley Police spokesperson said.Stansted Airport said all private aircraft use entirely independent terminals not operated by Stansted, and the airport does not manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAlex TaylorBBCPatrick Charnley awoke from a coma with a brain injury that has changed his perspective on lifeDying doesn't normally give a person new life - yet that is exactly what happened to Patrick Charnley.He was a high-flying corporate lawyer, who viewed downtime as \"wasted time\", restlessly pushing himself to success.But working long hours during the pandemic in 2021, the ultra-fit father-of-two suffered a cardiac arrest aged 39.What began as an unremarkable evening eating sausage and chips on the sofa ended with him collapsing unconscious. Triggered by a hereditary condition, his heart stopped. Patrick was clinically dead for 40 minutes.  His wife performed CPR, while his daughter and son, then nine and seven, ran to get help.Paramedics' defibrillation attempts failed. With his life slipping away, they tried adrenaline shots as a \"kind of final roll of the dice,\" says Patrick. They \"shocked and shocked and shocked [me]\", he adds. His wife began to suspect he was lost.Then miraculously, his heart started beating again.Patrick awoke from his week-long coma a changed man, with a brain injury that affects his sight, memory and stamina. Unable to work and live as he did before, he feels it's allowed him to be more present in life and relationships.It's a perspective shift, he tells Emma Barnett's Ready to Talk podcast, that he \"wouldn't change\" - even if given the chance to return to his old life.'I woke up blind'Still the journey to today's acceptance has been deeply traumatic.\"I woke up blind,\" says Patrick of his first waking memory. \"I was experiencing these things, but not really connecting with them.\"The loss of his eyesight sparked vivid hallucinations. Known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, the phenomenon is the brain's way of \"filling in\" sudden missing visual data.While some of these were \"frightening\"m he says others felt \"great\" and strangely beautiful.Patrick CharnleyPatrick on his 40th birthday, six months after his cardiac arrestIn one, after his open heart surgery, he became convinced an American nurse was trying to murder him.But these hallucinations could also provide calm. One took him to a sanitorium in the Alps, where he looked out across the snowy mountains while nurses chatted next door. The experience gave him a \"blissful\" sense of safety.As his vision slowly returned, doctors realised his sight issues were linked to a brain injury. His eyesight remains partially impaired, comparable to \"looking through a telescope\".Initial cognitive tests put him in the bottom 2% across memory and processing speed. Although vastly improved, he still sometimes struggles to retain immediate information.But the full impact of his injuries only became apparent once he returned home.Severe fatigue means he has to budget his energy. \"I never, ever wake up feeling refreshed. I wake up exhausted every day, and it gets worse as the day goes on,\" he explains.There have also been mental changes to adjust to. Patrick found he \"didn't care about anything\" after  his initial recovery. This wasn't depression per se, but a condition known as pathological apathy that Patrick describes as feeling like \"floating through time\" without solid ground.Therapy and medication have helped to revive his motivation, with a psychologist encouraging him to grieve the life he'd lost. Still, Patrick says he misses the spontaneity of life, and fitting in with people his age by \"participating in society\" as expected, as well as actively playing with his children.He also feels regret for his wife, who he feels he's \"outsourced\" his memory to. \"The truth is that she is my carer, really,\" he admits.\"I sort of live as if I'm really very, very old.\"'I live a richer existence'Despite the vast changes, Patrick says in many ways he prefers this life. He has changed careers to become an author and says he now has more time to enjoy life. \"I live life slowly now, not by choice, but because I have to. But I really appreciate that. I do see the beauty in things much more than I used to… I feel like I live a much richer existence by being slower,\" he says.\"My perspective has fundamentally altered. I feel grateful to be alive\".Patrick CharnleyPatrick on holiday with his children at the Lake DistrictHis relationship with his family has also changed for the better.He is able to laugh at the quirks of his condition with them. \"I think we're more solid than ever, really… we have a much closer bond because of what's happened,\" he adds.\"The most important thing to me has always been my family, but now I am able to give so much more of myself to it. Before I was living almost on the surface of it,\" he says.Patrick's unique situation has allowed him to break free of the daily work grind.\"So many people feel like that… I'm too busy to live my life. I wouldn't change what happened.\"Even with the limitations, I like my life now. I like being home when the children come home from school. I like not rushing from one thing to the next.\"",

    "body": "On Wednesday, Norway's state broadcaster NRK shared a statement by Laegreid in which he apologised both to his ex-girlfriend and Botn. \"I deeply regret bringing up this personal story on what was a day of celebration for Norwegian biathlon,\" Laegreid told NRK - Norway's state broadcaster. \"I am not quite myself these days, and I am not thinking clearly. My apologies go to Johan-Olav, who deserved all the attention after winning gold.\"My apologies also go to my ex-girlfriend, who unwillingly ended up in the media spotlight. I hope she is doing well.\"I cannot change what has happened, but I will now put this behind me and focus on the Olympics. I will not be answering any further questions about this.\"In a news conference on Tuesday, Laegreid had said he hoped he had not \"ruined\" his team-mate's day, but insisted: \"I stand by my choice.\"Former team-mate Johannes Thingnes Boe - a five-time biathlon gold medallist - told Norwegian state broadcaster NRK that Laegreid was \"completely wrong\".",

    "body": "Dad unlawfully killed daughter in Texas shooting, coroner rules13 hours agoFacebookLucy Harrison was killed at the home of her father in Prosper, Texas, prompting a manslaughter investigationTom MullenNorth WestA British woman who was shot dead by her father while visiting his home in Texas was unlawfully killed, a coroner has ruled.Lucy Harrison, from Warrington in Cheshire, was shot in the chest on 10 January 2025 in Prosper, near Dallas. Police in the town investigated the 23-year-old's death as possible manslaughter but no criminal case was brought against Kris Harrison after a grand jury in Collin County declined to indict him. Family members were in tears during the hearing at Cheshire Coroner's Court as Coroner Jacqueline Devonish announced that she found Lucy Harrison died due to unlawful killing on the grounds of gross negligence manslaughter.The coroner said: \"To shoot her through the chest whilst she was standing would have required him to have been pointing the gun at his daughter, without checking for bullets, and pulling the trigger. \"I find these actions to be reckless.\"'Deep shock'Speaking after the hearing, Lucy Harrison's mother Jane Coates said: \"Today's outcome has finally given Lucy her voice back after what has been an unrelenting year of deep shock, grief and fight - fight with quiet focus and steely determination to allow Lucy to speak her truth with the only voice she has now.\"While we recognise an unlawful killing outcome has been decided in a coroner's court and not a criminal court, we welcome the coroner's conclusion and thank her for exploring all the evidence fairly and as fully as she could and fearlessly for Lucy.\"The inquest heard the father, described by the coroner as a functioning alcoholic, claimed the gun had gone off accidentally.Lucy Harrison's boyfriend Sam Littler, who had travelled with her to the US, had earlier told the hearing she had become upset after she and her father argued about Donald Trump, who was due to be inaugurated as president later that month.ReutersDonald Trump was inaugurated for his second presidential term 10 days after Lucy Harrison's deathLittler said about half an hour before they were expected to leave for the airport Kris Harrison took his daughter by the hand and led her from the kitchen to his ground floor bedroom, where he kept a Glock semi-automatic handgun in his bedside cabinet.The father did not attend the two-day hearing but in a statement said he had bought the weapon to give his family a \"sense of security\" and, as it was for home defence, Texas laws meant he did not need a licence.He claimed he had a conversation about guns with his daughter and she asked to see the gun, having never discussed his gun ownership with him before.But the inquest heard evidence from others that Lucy Harrison, a fashion buyer for the Boohoo clothes retailer, knew her father had a weapon in the home and disagreed with it.In the statement, Kris Harrison, who admitted drinking wine earlier in the day, said: \"As I lifted the gun to show her I suddenly heard a loud bang. I did not understand what had happened. Lucy immediately fell.\"He told police who attended the scene: \"We got it out to have a look and just as I picked it up it just went off.\"The inquest heard a grand jury in the US had determined there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone in connection with Lucy Harrison's death.More on this story",

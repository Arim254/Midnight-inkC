    "body": "The World Cup draw is here - this is how it will workImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington DC has been chosen for the World Cup draw, though the city will not host any matchesByFootball issues correspondentPots, quadrants, confederation constraints, group position grids... the 2026 World Cup finals draw on Friday is not going to be a straightforward affair.  There's a lot to unpack so we're going to explain it as simply as we can.Luckily, Fifa will have a computer to do most of the heavy lifting and make sure everything runs smoothly. Though as Uefa found out in 2021, sometimes technology does go wrong. Let's hope there will be no gremlins in Washington once the draw ceremony kicks off.Here is how it will work, what to expect and a few key things to look out for. When will draw start and how long will it take?Media caption, Dan Roan reports from Washington before the 2026 World Cup drawThe ceremony gets started at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time) on 5 December, but there's going to be far more to this glitzy event than simply pulling the countries out of a hat. Supermodel Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor and producer Danny Ramirez will co-host.Before the draw there will be live music performances from Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger, while Fifa president Gianni Infantino and US President Donald Trump are both expected to make speeches.Then it is on to video clips of the finalists, introductions and the draw itself.Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand will conduct the draw.The 47-year-old will be joined by broadcaster Samantha Johnson and a host of sporting greats, including Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal.Once the draw has been completed, the Village People will perform YMCA to bring the curtain down, with the entire ceremony expected to last about 90 minutes.How has Fifa seeded the draw?The 48 teams have been placed into four pots of 12 based primarily on Fifa world rankings.The exceptions are the three hosts who are automatically in pot one, and the teams who will qualify through the six play-off paths, who go into pot four.Given some of the teams involved in the four European play-off paths, they have the potential to create some strong groups.Italy and Denmark would have been in pot two because of their world rankings had they qualified directly, while Wales would have been in pot three.The six play-off paths are:Uefa Play-off A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern IrelandUefa Play-off B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania, SwedenUefa Play-off C: Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo, RomaniaUefa Play-off D: Denmark, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland, North MacedoniaFifa Play-off 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New CaledoniaFifa Play-off 2: Iraq, Bolivia, SurinameHow will the draw work?The 12 groups will include one team from each of the four pots.Fifa will start by drawing the teams from pot one.Co-hosts Mexico (A1), Canada (B1) and the United States (D1) will have coloured balls with their flags on to denote their special status. Their group positions are pre-determined to make sure they play all their games in their own countries.The draw will then continue with pots two, three and four in order.What is this about the top four teams being kept apart?Fifa's big idea is to set up the best chance of blockbuster ties in the latter stages of the World Cup. So for the first time it is giving special seeding status to the top four in the world rankings - Spain, Argentina, France and England.Crucially, this status will only apply if the countries win their groups. Let's take a look at how it will work, using England as our example.Each of the four countries will be drawn into a group in a different coloured quadrant of the bracket, as shown in the image below. Spain (ranked 1) and Argentina (2) must be in opposite halves and cannot meet until the final, likewise France (3) and England (4). France and England would not be able to meet either Spain or Argentina until the semi-finals. Let's say that France come out first and go into Group C, placing them into the green quadrant on the right side of the draw. That means England can only go into the blue or turquoise quadrants on the left side, groups E, F, G, H or I.If Argentina then drop into the blue quadrant, that further restricts England only to turquoise - groups G or H.    Are the four seeds being given an easy ride? Not necessarily.Each quadrant has a potential last-16 tie between two group winners. For instance, the blue quadrant has a meeting of the winners of Group E and Group I. That means a seeded team could meet another pot one side, let's say perhaps Brazil.Being drawn into groups C, F, H or J looks potentially more favourable, as it is not possible to play another group winner until the quarter-finals.If one of the four seeded teams finishes as group runners-up, then they lose the ranking privilege. So if England were to finish second in Group H, they would move out of turquoise and into red - perhaps meeting Spain, Argentina or France as the winners of Group J in the first knockout round.Image source, FifaImage caption, If Spain, Argentina, France and England win their groups they will slot into separate quadrants for the knockout bracketWhat are the draw restrictions to watch out for?There can be no more than one team from the same confederation per group. So, for instance, Brazil and Uruguay (Conmebol) cannot be in the same group, nor can Panama and the United States (Concacaf). There is an exception for Uefa because there are 16 teams and only 12 groups. That means four groups will contain two European nations. It all seems relatively straightforward, but as we go on these constraints are going to cause some serious complications as countries skip groups to avoid clashes with teams from their own confederation. That means it will not just be case of teams slotting into Group A, and then Group B, and then Group C in order as they are drawn. When we get to pots three and four, it might seem like countries are being sent to random groups. Fifa needs to prevent something called deadlocking, which happens when it is no longer possible to complete the draw while following the regulations.  The major issue comes from the teams who can potentially qualify via the inter-confederation play-off pathways and will go into pot four. Pathway 1 has New Caledonia (OFC), Jamaica (Concacaf) and DR Congo (CAF)Pathway 2 has Bolivia (Conmebol), Suriname (Concacaf) and Iraq (AFC)Both pathways have a Concacaf team, so they are automatically blocked out of four groups (those containing the United States, Mexico, Canada and Panama). The first pathway is less of problem, because the only other Oceania team, New Zealand, are also in pot four. But the second pathway makes it complicated, because there are 17 deadlocking nations in pots one, two and three. So, the only way to complete the draw is for the team that qualifies via this route to go into a group with two European countries and an African nation.What will this look like in practice?When pot two is being drawn, the computer will have to ensure that there is at least one group with two European teams, or one European and one African country.When it comes to pot three, there will then be two possible draw routes. If there is one group with two European nations in it, then Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia or Ivory Coast must join it. If there is one group with an African and European nation in it, then Norway or Scotland must go into it. Both could happen, in which case the draw computer will ensure one is filled as necessary. If we get to pot four and there is only one group which meets this criterion, pathway two will have to go into it.The other pot-four teams - the four potential play-off winners from Uefa, two from Concacaf, two African and one Asian nation - will have their own deadlock restrictions. The Uefa play-off paths, which include Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, will have limited options because 12 European teams will already have been drawn.   It might be hard to keep up at this point. How will teams be allocated to their groups?Once a team has been drawn they will go into the first available group, adhering to the draw constraints, in alphabetical order. The draw computer will ensure Spain, Argentina, France and England are placed in groups in the correct quadrant of the bracket.To speed up the process countries will not be drawn into their specific group positions to set the order of the fixtures.Seeded countries will all go into position one, with a pre-determined grid for all the other pots, as shown in the image below.For instance, let's take Scotland in pot three. Their fixture order will be determined by the yellow box.If they are drawn first from pot three they will go into Group A with Mexico. The grid shows the team from pot three will go into position two. The first match is A1 v A2, so Mexico would play Scotland in the opening game of the World Cup.Image source, FifaImage caption, The group position by pot has been pre-determined and will not be decided by drawWhen will teams find out when and where they will play?While nations will know their opponents and match dates on Friday, 5 December they will have to wait 24 hours to find out venues and kick-off times.The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations and already have venues for the fixtures, but not kick-off times.For all other groups, you'll know only the date and the order of matches when Fifa unveils the match schedule in a live broadcast on Saturday, 6 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). Fifa president Gianni Infantino will be joined on stage by legends of the game to discuss the key matches.All 12 groups will play fixtures in this order:Match Day 1: 1 v 2, 3 v 4Match Day 2: 1 v 3, 4 v 2Match Day 3: 4 v 1, 2 v 3",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has warned again that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war in Ukraine.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he told India Today. Moscow controls around 85% of Donbas.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.Putin's comments come after President Donald Trump said his negotiators discussing a US peace plan believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after Tuesday's talks in Moscow.Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who was in Moscow, is due to meet Ukraine's team in Florida.Trump said Tuesday's talks in the Kremlin were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin - but the Witkoff team presented a modified version in Moscow.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said he had not seen the new version before his talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" the Kremlin leader said.He also said Moscow disagreed with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said straight after the talks that they produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stalling any ceasefire agreements, saying Moscow is seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.Commenting on the Kremlin talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia said  Putin was \"wasting the world's time\".Ukraine has long insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\" - but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.The Ukrainian president said last week his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during talks with an American delegation in Geneva on 23 November.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said at the time that they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city last week, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.In a statement to the BBC, the White House said: \"Secretary [Marco] Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr Kushner, and the President's entire national security team are working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine.\"\"They have held productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable, enforceable peace,\" the statement read.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenThe parliament of the Faroe Islands voted on Thursday to legalise abortion until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy, overturning a decades-old law that prohibited abortions in most cases.Previous legislation allowed abortions only in certain circumstances - such as rape, incest or risk to the health of the pregnant woman - and meant the self-governing Danish territory had among the most restrictive abortion policies in Europe. Following a heated parliamentary debate, the decision came down to the wire, with MPs narrowly voting in favour of the reform, by 17 to 16.\"This is truly an historic day in the Faroe Islands,\" said Ingilín Didriksen Strømm, one of the four MPs who tabled the bill.Strømm told the BBC: \"This change finally affirms women's autonomy over their own bodies in the Faroe Islands.\"\"It guarantees access to safe healthcare, and it also protects our freedom to make decisions about our own lives without fear, without stigma and without criminalisation,\" she added.The new legislation in the Faroe Islands - located between Scotland and Norway - is expected to come into effect on 1 July next year, replacing laws dating back to 1956.Under that legislation, abortions could only be performed in special circumstances - which also included if there are severe fetal health problems or if the woman is deemed \"unfit\" to care for the child.Whether a woman is \"unfit\" or not is judged first by a GP, and then a second medical body, before an abortion is granted. Both the woman and the doctor risked imprisonment if the conditions were not met.Faroese pro-choice campaigners have argued the legislation was outdated and impinged on women's rights.\"This is a colossal change,\" Bjørt Lind from pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val told Danish newspaper Politiken.\"Abortion has been so hidden and taboo in Faroese society. When we started our work, no one dared to talk about it. It has gotten much better,\" she says. \"But it's still a huge challenge.\"In a statement to the BBC, Amnesty International's Faroe Islands branch said: \"After years of campaigning we finally have a law respecting women's and all pregnant people's rights to a safe and legal abortion until week 12.\"\"This is a huge step for human rights, the right to bodily autonomy and to secure safe abortions,\"  it added. \"And Faroese women don't have to go on an expensive trip abroad to have an abortion.\"With limited access to abortions in the Faroe Islands, campaign groups said women often had to travel to Denmark for the procedure.Danish law has allowed abortion up to 12 weeks since 1973, and in June this year, that was amended to extend terminations on request until 18 weeks.According to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, some 43 countries in Europe allow \"abortion on request\" during the early stages of pregnancy. Only five - Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein, Poland and Monaco - maintain highly restrictive laws.Those opposed to the law change in the Faroe Islands, argued that the right of the fetus should be protected. Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against Thursday's bill, told Danish national broadcaster, DR, that he respects the result, but does not believe there is much support for the new law. \"I think we will see that some will try to roll it back,\" he said.The remote archipelago is home to around 56,000 people, who speak Faroese and have a distinct cultural identity. Compared to other Nordic countries, society in the Faroe Islands is considered relatively conservative, with more than three quarters of the population members of the Lutheran church.Previous attempts to liberalise abortion laws have failed. Most recently, in May last year, an almost identical bill resulted in a tied vote, failing to secure the majority required to pass the Faroese parliament.",

They were among a number of countries who had called for Israel to be excluded over the war in Gaza, as well as accusations of unfair voting practices.Spanish broadcaster RTVE led calls for a secret ballot on the issue at a meeting in Geneva. It said organisers denied that request - a decision that \"increased [our] distrust of the festival's organisation\".Ireland's RTÉ said it felt that its \"participation remains unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there which continues to put the lives of so many civilians at risk.\"ReutersSinger Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October Hamas attack in 2023, represented Israel at this year's EurovisionSpain is one of Eurovision's \"Big Five\" countries along with France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Their artists are allowed straight into the final, as their broadcasters provide the largest financial contribution to the EBU. Approximately 50 broadcasters, including the BBC, attended a meeting of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Thursday to discuss the future of the contest, which is watched by more than 150 million people each year.They were asked to back new rules intended to discourage governments and third parties from organising voting campaigns for their acts, after allegations that Israel unfairly boosted its entrant, Yuval Raphael, this year.BBC News understands that voting to accept those measures was tied to a clause whereby members agreed not to proceed with a vote on Israel's participation.\"This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,\" the EBU said.Getty ImagesAustrian singer JJ won May's contest in Basel, Switzerland, toppling Israel from pole position at the last minuteMartin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said he was \"pleased\" that members had been given an \"opportunity to debate\" Israel's place in the contest before the vote. \"It was a full, frank and honest and quite moving debate, but as we can see from the emphatic result, they really came together on a belief that the Eurovision Song Contest shouldn't be used as a political theatre, it must retain some sense of neutrality.\"Israel's President Isaac Herzog praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it \"an appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation, symbolising a victory over those who seek to silence Israel and spread hatred\".He said he was \"glad that Israel will participate again in Eurovision and I hope that the competition will remain one that sanctifies culture, poetry, and friendship between peoples and cross-border cultural understanding\". He added that Israel \"deserves to be represented on every stage in the world, and I am fully and actively committed to that\".The CEO of Israel's broadcaster, KAN, said the attempt to disqualify its entry \"can only be understood as a cultural boycott.\"A boycott may begin today - with Israel - but no-one knows where it will end or who else it may harm,\" said Golan Yochpaz. \"Is this what we truly want this contest to be remembered for on its 70th anniversary?\"The BBC, which broadcasts Eurovision in the UK, said in a statement: \"We support the collective decision made by members of the EBU. This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive.\"Getty ImagesSpanish singer Melody representing Spain in May's contest, with the song Esa divaHowever, the decision has exposed a deep rift in the Eurovision community. In a statement, Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said that \"participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values ​​that are essential to us\".Spanish broadcaster RTVE added: \"The board of directors of RTVE agreed last September that Spain would withdraw from Eurovision if Israel was part of it.\"\"This withdrawal also means that RTVE will not broadcast the Eurovision 2026 final... nor the preliminary semi-finals.\"Slovenia's broadcaster RTV added that their position also \"remains unchanged\". \"The recent rule changes do not alter our view. As a public service broadcaster, RTV Slovenia is committed to upholding ethical principles and expects that equal rules and standards apply to all EBU members and all participating countries.\"Belgium's broadcaster said it would \"take a position in the coming days\".Those who approved of the changes included Nordic broadcasters from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland who issued a joint statement saying they \"supported\" the EBU's decision to \"address critical shortcomings\" in the voting system.Despite that, Iceland's RÚV said it would not make a final decision on its participation until next week. Germany, which had threatened to leave the contest if Israel was removed, also welcomed Thursday's decision.Its broadcaster ARD said it was \"looking forward to participating\" next year, \"embracing it as a celebration of cultural diversity and solidarity\". It added: \"At the same time, we deeply regret the decisions of individual EBU members to withdraw from the ESC 2026 but, of course, respect the choices made by the respective broadcasters.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondentIn the days after a Washington Post report raised questions about a September strike by the US military on a suspected drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, lawmakers in Congress pledged to investigate further.It was a rare moment of bipartisan concern about a controversial Trump administration action – prompting speculation that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was narrowly confirmed to office in January, might be on shaky ground.\"Members are very concerned,\" Republican Congressman Mike Turner said in a television interview on Thursday morning. He added that his colleagues were questioning the accuracy of information provided to them by the Trump administration.By Thursday afternoon, however, after senior members of Congress reviewed footage and heard from the admiral in charge of the operation, familiar partisan divisions had begun to reemerge.Republicans defended the boat strike operation – and praised Hegseth.Democrats condemned what they saw – and called for further inquiries.At the heart of the divide is a fundamental disagreement over the legality, and morality, of the Trump administration's ongoing anti-narcotics military campaign in the Caribbean, including its decision to designate narcotics traffickers as \"terrorist organisations\" and to use lethal force against civilians without outside legal oversight.Since that first September attack, the US has conducted at least 22 similar strikes resulting in more than 80 deaths.The Post had reported last Friday that the US launched two attacks on the boat in question and that the second had killed two survivors from the first strike, who were in the water, clinging to the \"smoldering wreck\".The newspaper also said that prior to the attack Hegseth had given an order to \"kill them all\". In comments on Tuesday, the secretary said he witnessed the first attack but had left the room before the second strike took place.After being briefed by General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Frank Bradley, who oversaw the operation and gave the order for the second strike, none of the congressional lawmakers said they had heard evidence that Hegseth did, in fact, issue a \"kill everybody\" order.That, however, was where the consensus ended.Jim Himes of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said he found the video of the second attack \"deeply, deeply troubling\".\"The fact is that we killed two people who were in deep distress and had neither the means nor obviously the intent to continue their mission,\" he told reporters after the briefing.Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas disagreed, calling the strikes \"entirely lawful and needful\".\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight,\" he said.For the moment, these differing descriptions from partisan lawmakers, and the original Washington Post reporting, are all the American public has on which to base their own conclusions.That may change, however. Donald Trump has said he supports releasing the video of the second strike – as the Pentagon has done for many of its Caribbean operations in recent months.If the video is as disturbing as some Democrats say, it could shift public opinion that has been similarly divided largely along partisan lines.By Thursday evening, however, Hegseth's seemingly tenuous position seemed more secure, all the more so after an inspector general report left him largely unscathed.It did find he put military personnel and objectives at risk by discussing classified information over an unsecured app - the so-called Signalgate controversy which dominated headlines earlier in the year.But the conclusion was he did not transmit secret information because he himself says he had declassified it.Two potentially damaging stories have been defused, for now. It may not be too long, however, before Hegseth is in the spotlight once again.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "9 hours agoGordon CoreraBBC security analystWhen the call came in to the duty officer at MI6 headquarters on the evening of 4 March 2018, it was met with surprise and alarm. One of their agents was lying in a hospital bed, apparently poisoned.The realisation that Sergei Skripal had been targeted within the UK sent shockwaves through the world of British spies and raised important but difficult questions.Some of these questions have been answered by this latest report, which found Russian President Vladimir Putin \"morally responsible\" for the death of Dawn Sturgess.She unwittingly sprayed herself with the same nerve agent, concealed in a perfume bottle and discarded by the suspected Russian agents who poisoned Skripal.So have all the lessons been learnt?One question was whether more could have been done to protect Skripal. Skripal had been recruited to spy for MI6 back in the 1990s, but had then been caught by the Russians before being exchanged as part of a spy swap in 2010.At the time he came to the UK the assessment of the ongoing risk to him had been relatively low. After all, he had been pardoned. This was, top spies later admitted, a mistaken assumption. As a \"settled defector\" he also had his own say on what kind of security he wanted and he was clear that he did not want a new identity and a new life. That might have been the only thing to prevent the attack.The report says there may have been nothing to indicate that a dramatic attack using nerve agent might take place, but it does say there were not updated, regular assessments of the risks he faced.By 2014, the relationship with Russia was darkening thanks to the first crisis over Ukraine. Skripal was also talking to European intelligence services, which may have raised his risk profile. And Putin, a former spy himself, who frequently talks of his hatred for traitors, was not a man to forget betrayal. Nor was the GRU - the Russian military intelligence agency of which Skripal had been a member.The report suggests the use of Novichok nerve agent was a demonstration of power by the Russian state. But many inside the intelligence world believe what it really was intended to be was a message to others – if they betrayed Russian secrets to Western intelligence, they too would be hunted down even if it took years and even if their family was put at risk.This lesson was quickly learnt by British intelligence and security services, who immediately after the poisoning placed greater protection around defectors and others at risk in the UK.The report says there is no doubt that a unit of the GRU was responsible for the poisoning. They came into the country on a short-term mission and were able to deliver the poison and then leave, abandoning the Novichok-filled perfume bottle that would kill Dawn Sturgess.The operatives involved were named within months and the wider GRU unit has had many of its operations and some of the fake identities it uses exposed, not least by the investigative site Bellingcat. But could they do it again?Russian intelligence operations in the UK and Europe have been put under pressure. Following Salisbury and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there has been a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats across Europe to make it harder for them to operate. There is more information-sharing to try to detect the travel of operatives as well.But Russia has also adapted. In recent years, knowing it is harder to get Russian operatives into the UK, it has turned to proxies to carry out its work. For instance, a group of Bulgarians based in the UK were hired from Moscow to carry out surveillance on targets of Moscow for money. They were convicted earlier this year.They followed people on planes and talked about carrying out kidnappings. They were amateurs but still dangerous. \"Of course, they will fail 99% of the time. But the problem is that if they have 100 groups like this, one of this 100 will succeed,\" Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian journalist in exile in the UK and a target of the Bulgarians, told me. \"And they don't care about the 99 groups that will be arrested.\"This is a different model for Russian intelligence - using disposable agents for hire. They have also paid low-level British criminals to carry out arson attacks. This requires a different type of policing in order to be able to spot the activities, compared with the old ways of detecting spies. Counter Terrorism Police say their work to tackle threats from hostile states has grown five-fold since Salisbury.Today, Russia, its spies and its proxies are engaged in a low-level conflict with the UK and other European countries which involves carrying out acts of surveillance and sabotage. Their ability to carry out another poisoning on a defector using nerve agent is almost certainly diminished thanks to better awareness and stronger defences. But that does not mean there are not other types of danger.",

    "body": "4 hours agoFelicity Hannah,Big Boss InterviewandMichael Sheils McNamee,Business reporterPAWaterstones would stock books created using artificial intelligence, the company's boss has said, as long as they were clearly labelled, and if customers wanted them.However, James Daunt, a veteran of the bookselling industry, said he personally did not expect that to happen.\"There's a huge proliferation of AI generated content and most of it are not books that we should be selling,\" he said.But it would be \"up to the reader\".An explosion in the use of artificial intelligence, or AI, has prompted heated debate in the publishing industry, with writers concerned about the impact on their livelihoods.In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Big Boss podcast, Daunt said while Waterstones uses AI for logistics they currently try to keep AI generated content out of the shops.\"As a bookseller, we sell what publishers publish, but I can say that instinctively that is something that we would recoil [from],\" he said.Daunt, who is heading into his 36th Christmas season in the book trade, said Waterstones' success had been built on handing more control to individual store managers to serve their own communities.\"Head office is there to make life easier,\" he said.\"Make sure the books that they order turn up on time, but do not tell [managers] where to put them.\"Daunt also said he was a bit of an outlier in welcoming last week's Budget and he raised the prospect of a stock market flotation of the book chain.'Disdain for AI' A report published last month by the University of Cambridge found that more than half of published authors feared being replaced by artificial intelligence. Two-thirds also said their work had been used without permission or payment to train the large language models which lie behind generative AI tools.But some writers use AI themselves, especially for research, and AI tools are being used to edit novels, and even produce full-length works.\"Do I think that our booksellers are likely to put those kind of books front and centre? I would be surprised,\" Daunt says. \"Who's to know? [Technology firms] are spending trillions and trillions on AI and maybe it's going to produce the next War and Peace. \"And if people want to read that book, AI-generated or not, we will be selling it - as long as it doesn't pretend to [be] something that it isn't.\"We as booksellers would certainly naturally and instinctively disdain it,\" Daunt said.Readers value a connection with the author \"that does require a real person\" he added. Any AI-generated book would always be clearly labelled as such.The softly spoken former banker has overturned convention before. When he took over at Waterstones in 2011, he took the bold decision to end the practice of publishers paying to have their books displayed prominently in stores. It cost him £27m in lost revenue and prompted a \"nervous breakdown\" among publishers, he said, but it paid off and in 2016 the company returned to profit. Now Waterstones staff write their own book recommendations, choose books of the month, and the manager selects what goes on the display tables.As well as books, the chain stocks pens, reading lights, games, wrapping paper and other stationery.The strategy has helped it defy the decline on the High Street, with around ten new stores opening a year, and profits in 2024 of £33m against sales of £528m.Waterstones is part of a wider stable, including Foyles and Blackwell's, owned by  hedge fund Elliott Advisers.Daunt has also been appointed chief executive of Barnes and Noble, the large US bookstore chain also owned by Elliot Advisers.Share saleSuccess on both sides of the Atlantic has led to speculation that shares in Waterstones and Barnes and Noble could be jointly floated in either New York or London. \"It feels like an inevitability and probably better than being flipped to the next private equity person,\" says Daunt.Private owners naturally aim to sell businesses on, he points out. \"It's what they do.\"But it is not clear that London, which he says has been \"suffering\" as a location for initial public offerings lately, would be considered suitable.\"We're based out of London but we have a huge American business; Barnes and Noble is much larger than Waterstones.\"Helpful rate changeAs for last week's Budget, Daunt says it sometimes feels like he might be \"the only person who is sympathetic\" to the situation the chancellor is in.The government has drawn the ire of the business community for raising employer National Insurance and the minimum wage and not coming up with more growth-boosting measures.But the Budget included changes that were \"very helpful\" to companies like his, said Daunt.Getty ImagesWaterstones has seen success despite a general trend of High Street decline over the past decadeBusiness rates will be lower for retailers operating out of small sites, while larger business properties, like warehouses will pay more. Daunt said that although Waterstones does have larger premises, levelling the playing field between High Street and online retailers was something he has been calling for for a long time.  With the days of advent now ticking past, the company is well into the se portion of the year when Waterstones makes about 70% of its annual profit.He says the post-pandemic rebound, with people returning to bookshops, does not seem to have gone away.Personally he has also retained his love of reading, even after 36 years in the industry. But he does have one bad book habit, he said. \"Because I read professionally, I do a rather awful thing which is start a lot of books and then not finish them.\"I love the excitement of opening up a first novel and not knowing what's going to come of it. But if it isn't quite that good, I'll just move on.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe number of flu patients in hospital has hit a record high in England for this time of year with NHS leaders warning the country is facing an unprecedented flu season.NHS figures show there were an average of 1,700 patients in hospital with flu last week - that is more than 50% higher than the same time last year - and early indications from this week are that hospitalisations have continued climbing sharply since.It comes as the flu season hit a month earlier than normal this year, with experts warning there appears to be a more severe strain of the virus circulating.England's chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty has warned the NHS must take diseases like pneumonia and flu in older people much more seriously to save lives. Meanwhile, NHS bosses are urging patients not to clog up A&E with everyday niggles as new figures show thousands turned to hospitals for minor ailments such as hiccups and ingrowing toenails last winter.There were more than 200,000 A&E attendances in England from November to February for conditions that could have been dealt with elsewhere, according to NHS England.This represents more than 2% of all attendances during that four-month period, taking up vital resources at under-pressure A&Es, health bosses said.Patients with such minor conditions are being advised to seek help elsewhere, including from pharmacists, GPs and NHS 111 – either via the phone or online – as some of them can be managed at home.NHS England urgent and emergency care director Prof Julian Redhead said alongside the high number of flu cases in hospital the NHS was having to plan for more doctor strikes in the lead up to Christmas.British Medical Association members are taking part in a five-day walkout from 17 December in their long-running pay dispute.Prof Redhead said: \"Today's numbers confirm our deepest concerns - the health service is bracing for an unprecedented flu wave this winter. Cases are incredibly high for this time of year and there is no peak in sight yet.\"He said staff could be stretched \"close to breaking point\" in the coming weeks.Already close to 2% of beds are occupied by flu patients, with the 1,700 average last week the highest at this point of winter since records began in 2010. And at an NHS England board meeting on Thursday morning chief executive Sir Jim Mackey warned the numbers were continuing to rise sharply.\"We've had a really, really big increase,\" he said.He suggested by the end of next week there could be anywhere between 5,000 and 8,000 beds occupied by flu patients. The highest level ever recorded so far is 5,400.He said with this in mind the forthcoming doctor strike felt \"cruel\" and \"calculated\" and aimed at \"causing mayhem\".Prof Redhead said because of the demands being place on the NHS it was vital patients used services sensibly.NHS England published A&E attendance figures showing between 1 November 2024 and 28 February 2025 there were:6,382 visits for nasal congestion 83,705 visits for earache 96,998 visits for sore throats3,890 visits for ingrowing nails8,669 for itching skin384 for hiccupsThe attendances were to either major A&E units or minor injury units run by hospitals.Although research shows one of the factors driving unnecessary A&E visits is difficulty accessing GP services, with latest figures showing more than a fifth of patients cannot get through to their GP on the day they try.And Dr Vicky Price, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the emphasis on unnecessary A&E attendances was just a \"smokescreen\" to distract from the pressures frontline staff were dealing with.She pointed out that there had already been nearly half a million waits of over 12 hours in A&E for patients, depriving them of privacy and dignity.\"These delays are not caused by minor ailments but are a result of a failure to address the longstanding issues of capacity, flow and workforce.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

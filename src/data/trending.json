    "body": "12 hours agoEmily Holt & Yasmin RufoBBC NewsBBCWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands. In an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair. 1. Cold water doesn't make your hair shinier Getty ImagesEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair? Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair. \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.2. No product can repair damaged hair Getty ImagesIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"Other stories you may enjoy3. Your hair won't self-clean  Getty ImagesYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all. But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\" Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too. Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.  Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.4. Dry shampoo isn't a substitute for washingGetty ImagesFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower. Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes. The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out. \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says. \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

    "body": "2 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent Eurostar has revealed plans to run double-decker trains through the Channel Tunnel for the first time.The cross-channel rail operator has confirmed it will order up to 50 trains from manufacturer Alstom, eventually increasing the size of its fleet by nearly a third.The expansion plans would include investing heavily in a crucial London depot, it said.But questions remain over whether the facility has enough space for both Eurostar and potential rival operators to use it.In the €2bn (£1.74bn) deal, confirmed on Wednesday, Eurostar has ordered 30 \"Celestia\" trains, with the option for 20 more. Eurostar expects to start using the first six trains in 2031.Each train would be 200m long. If two were run together, as happens currently, the resulting 400m service would have about 1,080 seats. These would be the first double-decker high-speed trains to run through the Channel Tunnel.The only other double-decker passenger service to ever appear on Britain's railways was an experiment that began in 1949.Eurostar's chief executive Gwendoline Cazenave said she was \"particularly proud to bring double-decker trains to the UK for the very first time\", adding they would bring \"exceptional comfort\".Eurostar carried 19.5 million passengers last year. Ms Cazenove said the company aimed to grow this number to 30 million.The firm said a fleet of new trains, some of which will replace older ones, will lead to a 30% increase in trains that service London.The double-decker train deal comes after Eurostar announced an expansion plan in June that includes new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt from London.The new trains will need to go through a years-long certification process for use in the Channel Tunnel, in all the countries where Eurostar operates.They will be 4.33metres high, just 16cm higher than the E320 models currently in use.Tony Miles, railway journalist and commentator, told the BBC that Eurostar selling more seats on double-decker trains could potentially lead to cheaper prices for passengers.\"It costs exactly the same to run the train whether it's got twice the number of seats or not,\" he said.\"You still have only one driver, still use the same track.\"Mr Miles suggested Eurostar had pulled a \"cunning move\" by announcing the roll-out of larger trains in response to murmurings of increased competition from other rail companies.He added they had \"seized an opportunity\" to make the move with some its fleet approaching retirement.While the high-speed line between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel was built to European standards enabling it to be used by taller trains, as double-decker trains are common on the Continent, double-deckers becoming the norm across the Britain's rail network seems unlikely.Pete Waterman, music producer and railway enthusiast, told the BBC's Today programme because Britain's railways were established two centuries ago, most the routes would not be able to cater for such large trains due to obstructions such as tunnels, overhead lines and bridges.Such costs to adapt the network for double deckers would be \"absolutely astronomical,\" he said.\"Although Eurostar is to be applauded for announcing this, you can only get into St Pancras because most of British railways you can't put double deckers on because our railways were built 200 years ago, not just after the Second World War,\" he added.Mark Smith, founder of international train travel website Seat61.com, added the Eurostar announcement was \"obviously good news for travellers\", saying upper deck seats offered the \"best views\" during journeys.Eurostar also said it would invest €80m developing the Temple Mills depot in London, which is the only depot in the UK able to accomodate the larger trains used in continental Europe.That depot, owned by the government's London St Pancras Highspeed organisation, is currently exclusively used by Eurostar.Eurostar is also the only company currently offering cross-Channel rail services between London and Paris, but others want to set up rival services.Those companies include Spanish start-up Evolyn, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.The Office of Rail and Road is reviewing proposals from these firms to use Temple Mills, as well as Eurostar's plans to increase services.The regulator is expected to make a decision on access to the depot within weeks.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSima Kotecha,senior UK correspondent and Myranda MowafiBBCMore than 300 people have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism, corruption and bullying of victims by police after a Panorama undercover investigation.The secret filming over seven months revealed evidence of racism, misogyny and officers revelling in the use of force at one of London's busiest police stations.One of the main themes among the hundreds of people getting in touch was misogyny when they reported domestic abuse and sexual violence - with some women saying reporting their rape to police \"was like being raped again\".In response to the latest allegations, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it was \"working hard to build a culture based on integrity and trust\" and improving vetting and misconduct procedures.We have spoken to many of the women who contacted us through Your Voice, Your BBC News with stories of mistreatment, whose experiences span police forces across England - from rural counties to big cities. We have changed their names to protect their identities.A police officer allegedly told Joanna to \"grow a pair\" when she reported being punched in the face by her partner several months ago, she told us.Her partner had been drinking excessively when he returned home and angrily attacked her, she says. She found herself at the local police station in tears.\"I was devastated and the police made it 10 times worse. My face had a bruise from the punch and one of the officers looked at me as if I was exaggerating the whole thing,\" she said.\"He told me to grow a pair... followed by a chuckle. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It took so much to go there in the first place and then I wished I hadn't.\"Unmasked: Secret BBC filming exposes hidden culture of misogyny and racism inside Met PoliceWhy BBC sent undercover reporter into a busy London police stationMet officers face fast-track hearings after Panorama investigationOne woman was motivated to get in touch with the BBC by a scene Panorama filmed of a Metropolitan Police officer being dismissive of a pregnant woman's allegations of rape and domestic violence. The officer said of her account to a colleague: \"That's what she says.\"Ava was also pregnant when she fled her abusive partner, who she says repeatedly raped and hit her. She said the treatment and attitude of the officers she met that night meant she would never turn to the police in future.She said she was devastated that they did not believe her, telling her that \"nobody gets raped more than once\".\"It was like being raped all over again,\" she said. \"What they put me through was worse than what I was going through before\".Sgt Joe McIlvenny was filmed dismissing an alleged rape victim's testimonyAva says evidence that would have supported her case was \"wilfully ignored\" and she was told that without CCTV evidence of an attack, \"it is just your word against his\".She believes being a black woman made matters worse.\"The colour of my skin meant everything was stacked against me. The language they used and how dismissive and mocking they were, was both misogynist and racist,\" she said.\"They asked why I thought he was doing it to me - as if I was the problem, as if I'd brought it all on myself.\"Policing Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the government would not tolerate these \"sickening comments\" and urged people to report them.She said police chiefs had been given new powers to dismiss officers who commit gross misconduct. \"We will root out those unfit to serve the public,\" she said.Another woman, Claire, told us how she escaped her abusive former partner, who had coercively controlled her for 12 years, only to find that police did not want to get involved when he breached court orders to stay away from her.On one occasion, her former partner entered her home and locked her out, despite an injunction banning him from the property.She said it took the police more than seven hours to arrive and then \"they just stood laughing and chatting with him\". She and her three children ended up having to stay with a friend for months.\"I felt even more afraid and more isolated after speaking to the police. It's a boys' club - a network across police stations, police forces and county lines,\" Claire said.\"I would never call the police and I still worry he'll find me and show up.\"Getty ImagesCharing Cross station was the focus of the BBC's investigation, but the latest allegations come from across EnglandA training programme called Domestic Abuse Matters was developed by the College of Policing in 2016. It is used by 37 out of 44 police forces in England and Wales to improve the way they deal with victims of sexual and domestic violence.And part of the NPCC and College of Policing strategy on violence against women and girls says that one of its priorities is to challenge sexism and misogyny among officers.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Millichap, NPCC lead for violence against women and girls, told the BBC police chiefs were working with survivors of domestic abuse and sexual offences to continue to reform training, \"with a key focus on first responders' understanding of the dynamics of abuse and their empathy with victims\".She said \"officers must feel confident in calling out misogyny and sexism within policing\" but that improved vetting and misconduct procedures were \"having an impact in identifying and dismissing those who should not be in policing\".One of the women who contacted the BBC said that having watched the Panorama programme, she was shocked that nothing had changed in the decades since she was raped as a teenager.\"I have never had a night without a nightmare as a result, I've buried a lot of what the police officers asked me. They spoke down to me - like I was part of the problem,\" the woman, now in her 40s, said.\"Watching Panorama, I realised I must be one of thousands, I'm not the only one. They made me feel I was.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorThere's relief for many today that inflation didn't hit the feared 4% last month - relief for households, the government and the Bank of England.But at 3.8% in the year to September, inflation remains considerably above the Bank's target and while that persists, consumers may remain jittery about spending, uneasy about the future path of prices. After all, during the spike in inflation a couple of years back, they experienced the equivalent of more than a typical decade's worth of price rises in just two years. They, and their finances, are scarred.And inflation in some areas such as services - think hotels and restaurants - remains stubborn. Sectors such as hospitality are most likely to have seen their wage bills rise substantially - analysts suggest by as much as 10% - due to government policies such as higher minimum wages and tax increases over the past year.But there are signs that things are settling down - food prices eased for the first time in months in September, as the impact of higher commodity prices fades a little. While food makes up a relatively small part of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, it is the most visible form of price rises. Meanwhile, economists feel that the impact of some of the other higher costs firms have been passing on may be peaking. Economists expect inflation to fall back towards the 2% target next year.And remember, on average wage rises are comfortably outpacing inflation, so the cost-of-living squeeze is easing for many, even if it may not feel like it. Plus, traditionally these figures are used to uprate many benefits for working age people - some may see an increase of about 6% in their universal credit payments next spring.Following the release of the latest inflation figures, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was not satisfied with progress so far in bearing down on price rises. She went on to hint at help to come in November's Budget, with, we understand, some relief expected on energy bills. Businesses, however, remain cautious - some retailers are warning that further tax rises in the Budget may cause a resurgence in inflationary pressures. And until the Bank of England feels that inflation is firmly under control, it's always going to be cautious about cutting interest rates. So while there's still unlikely to be a cut in rates in November, analysts think there may be a growing chance of a \"Santa cut\" in December - just in time for Christmas. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and John Sudworth,KyivDSNS UkraineA man was reported killed and children wounded in an attack on a kindergarten in KharkivAt least seven people have been killed including two children during intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, officials say.A kindergarten was hit in Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv and there was widespread damage in Kyiv. Children were among the 27 people wounded.Hours earlier, US President Donald Trump said his plans for an imminent summit in Budapest with Russia's Vladimir Putin had been shelved as he did not want a \"wasted meeting\".President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks proved Moscow had not come under enough pressure for its continued war.The Kremlin has rejected calls for a ceasefire along the current front lines made both by Trump and European leaders.However, Russian officials said on Wednesday that preparation for a Trump-Putin summit was continuing, disputing the US president's assessment that it had been put on hold.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a date had yet to be agreed upon and careful preparation was needed. He said a summit was \"the mutual desire of both presidents\" and most of the \"gossip and rumours\" surrounding it were untrue. Ukraine's president arrived in Norway on Wednesday at the start of a European trip, days after talks with Trump in Washington last Friday, when he failed to persuade the US president to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles.Zelensky told reporters in Oslo that Trump's proposal to freeze the front line was a \"good compromise, but I'm not sure that Putin will support it and I said it to the president\".The Ukrainian leader has directly linked the shelving of the planned Trump-Putin summit to his request for US Tomahawks: \"As soon as the issue of long-range missiles became a little further away for us, for Ukraine, then almost automatically Russia became less interested in diplomacy.\"Russia's drone and missile bombardment came shortly after Ukraine's military said it had attacked a Russian chemical plant in the Bryansk border region late on Tuesday with UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.Calling the strike \"a successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system, military officials said the Bryansk plant \"produces gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles employed by the enemy to shell the territory of Ukraine\".DSNS UkraineA woman and two children were killed when their house was set alight in the village of PohrebyRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and its attacks on the Ukrainian capital overnight were the first such strikes for almost two weeks.A couple in their 60s were killed when a drone hit their high-rise building in the city, and four people were killed in the wider Kyiv region. Among the victims were a 36-year-old woman, a six-month-old baby and a girl, aged 12, when a Russian strike set fire to their house in the village of Pohreby, just to the north of the capital. A man in a nearby village later died of his injuries.Officials in Kharkiv said later that a 40-year-old man was killed and seven other people were hurt in a drone strike on a kindergarten. Children were among the six people wounded, and dozens more were evacuated, they added.Ukraine's air force said Russia had sent 405 drones and 28 missiles, 15 of which were ballistic.The capital was under a ballistic missile warning for most of the night, and echoed to the sound of explosions. By morning rescue teams fought fires in residential buildings.Across Ukraine, Russian attacks once again targeted energy infrastructure and emergency power outages were imposed in several areas.One MP in Kyiv, Inna Sovsun, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the air raids had lasted throughout the night and were definitely an attack on the power supply: \"for the majority like myself it means we don't have electricity and we don't have water.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoAnna Holligan,Hague correspondent and David GrittenThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) is to deliver an advisory opinion on Israel's legal obligations towards UN agencies and other international organisations operating in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.The UN's top court received a request from the General Assembly late last year, after Israel's parliament passed laws banning any activity by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) on Israeli territory and contact with Israeli officials.Israel accused Unrwa of being infiltrated by Hamas. The agency denied the claim, insisting it was impartial.The ICJ was asked to also cover in its opinion Israel's duty to allow the unhindered delivery of essential supplies to Palestinians.Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza after the start of its war with Hamas two years ago and has since restricted - and at times completely stopped - the entry of food and other aid for the 2.1 million population.Before this month's ceasefire deal, UN-backed global experts had estimated that more than 640,000 people were facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity and that there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City. Israel rejected the findings, insisting it was allowing in sufficient food. It also blames Hamas for stealing aid.The ICJ's panel of international judges was asked to clarify two questions in the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly in December.Firstly, whether Israel's ban on Unrwa breaches UN conventions guaranteeing the independence of UN agencies.And secondly, whether Israel's restrictions on aid crossings into Gaza violate international humanitarian law, including its duties as an occupying power to protect civilians.While the opinion will be a non-binding legal clarification, it carries significant moral and diplomatic weight.At the start of the hearings at The Hague in April, the UN's Under-Secretary General for Legal Affairs Elinor Hammarskjöld told the court that, as the occupying power in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel's obligations entailed \"allowing and facilitating all relevant United Nations entities to carry out their activities for the benefit of the local population\".These activities included relief schemes, such as the provision of foodstuffs, as well as caring for and educating children, and maintaining medical services, she said.She also argued that as a UN member state, Israel had legal obligations under UN conventions to uphold the privileges and immunities of the UN and its premises, property, assets and personnel so it could function properly and fulfil its mandates.\"When the basic elements of this legal framework are not observed, the very nature of the work of the organisation on behalf of its member states is in jeopardy,\" she warned.Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, legal counsel for the Palestinian government, said Israel's \"violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, its attacks on the United Nations and on United Nations officials, property and premises, its deliberate obstruction of the organisation's work, and its attempt to destroy an entire United Nations subsidiary organ, are unprecedented\".Israel considers this ICJ procedure a \"political circus\" and \"abuse of international law and institutions\".It filed a written statement saying the court's involvement undermined its self-defence and counterterrorism rights under international law.\"No state is expected to accept or to facilitate grave risk to its citizens and territory. On the contrary, international law prescribes the right and obligation of a state in acting to defend its existence, its territory, and its people,\" the statement said.It also argued that there were no obligations for a UN member state to co-operate with a UN agency or respect its immunities \"where the legitimate security concerns of a member state are severely undermined by the agency in question\".Unrwa - the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza, with 12,000 Palestinian staff - has challenged Israel's allegation that it knowingly has Hamas members in its ranks, or that it co-operated with the armed group.The UN said last year that it had fired nine of Unrwa's staff members in Gaza after investigators found evidence that they might have been involved in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages.Another 10 Unrwa staff were cleared because of insufficient evidence.Israel also alleged that hundreds of Unrwa staff were members of proscribed terrorist groups, but an independent review commissioned by the UN found it had not provided evidence to support its claim.Since the Israeli laws took effect in January, Unrwa says its Palestinian staff have continued providing assistance and education, health and other services to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. However, the agency says Israel has banned it from bringing aid into Gaza and stopped issuing visas to Unrwa's international staff.Unrwa says at least 309 of its staff and 72 people supporting the agency's activities have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza. The territory's Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks during the conflict have killed at least 68,229 people in total.This is the first formal legal inquiry into whether a UN member state can lawfully exclude a UN agency from its territory.This hearing is therefore about far more than Unrwa: it is about whether the international system can still enforce its own rules when a major UN member state challenges the legitimacy of UN institutions operating under its authority.",

    "body": "'Last woman hanged was abuse victim and should be pardoned'2 hours agoNicholas BourneBBC WalesBettmann Archive/Getty ImagesRuth Ellis' grandchildren believe she should be pardonedThe grandchildren of the last woman to be hanged in Britain are seeking a posthumous pardon, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by her partner before she killed him.Nightclub hostess Ruth Ellis, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, was executed on 13 July 1955 after being convicted of murdering her lover David Blakely.She was hanged at London's Holloway Prison.\"We are determined to do what we can to right this historic injustice and honour not only Ruth but all victims of domestic abuse who have been let down by the criminal justice system,\" said her granddaughter Laura Enston.Ellis shot Blakely outside The Magdala pub in Hampstead, London, following a tumultuous relationship involving infidelity on both sides.Ellis had an abortion, which was illegal in the UK at the time, and was physically abused by the racing driver - including being punched in the stomach during an argument that led to her miscarriage.The British public was already questioning whether capital punishment had a place in 20th Century society and, two years after Ellis' hanging, legal changes saw diminished responsibility introduced as a defence.The judge told the jury in her case to disregard the fact that the mother-of-two had been \"badly treated by her lover\" as a defence.Ellis's grandchildren have now applied to justice secretary David Lammy seeking a conditional pardon. Her family have spent decades fighting for her case to be reconsidered.\"She is a murderer but she didn't deserve to be taken from the world in the way that she was,\" said grandson Stephen Beard. He has taken part in a new Welsh-language S4C documentary, Ruth Ellis: Y Cariad a'r Crogi [The Lover and the Hanging] - available to watch on iPlayer - which re-examines her case with legal experts.PA MediaDavid Blakely was killed by Ruth EllisThinking about Ellis's final moments, granddaughter Ms Enston said: \"I can't begin to imagine what was going on in her head.\"She told the programme her grandmother's \"execution has had a devastating impact on our family\".\"My mother and uncle suffered from trauma from which neither of them were able to recover, and as grandchildren we have felt these ripple effects,\" she said.\"The evidence shared with the justice secretary makes clear that the punishment did not fit the crime.\"Under cross-examination, Ellis admitted that she intended to kill Blakely, and the jury took just 20 minutes to convict her of murder - a charge that carried a mandatory death sentence.Unlike court appeals, pardons can consider broader factors, such as social developments, that may render a conviction or its resulting punishment inappropriate or unfair.'Very tormented woman'Ms Enston said that the case had resulted in Ellis's children being dogged by mental health problems, describing her mother as \"a very tormented woman\", while her uncle took his own life.Alex Bailin KC, representing Ellis's family, added: \"Thankfully, 70 years after Ruth was hanged, there is now a much better understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on the emotional wellbeing and behaviour of victims.\"Based on the evidence we have reviewed, if Ruth's case had taken place in modern times, she would have been able to plead a defence of diminished responsibility or loss of control.\"A posthumous conditional pardon for Ruth Ellis would correct a historical wrong and send a clear message to the public that violence against women and girls is never acceptable.\"More top storiesRelated links",

    "body": "Mother of Baby P begins latest bid for release24 minutes agoITV NewsPeter Connelly died following months of abuseA parole hearing to decide whether to re-release the mother of Baby P, who was jailed over his death following months of abuse, has heard \"extremely moving\" victim statements from the child's loved ones.Tracey Connelly was jailed at the Old Bailey in 2009 for causing or allowing the death of her 17-month-old son Peter - known as Baby P - at their home in Tottenham, north London, on 3 August 2007.The public hearing is being held to decide whether she can be re-released or if she can be moved to open conditions.Sally Allbeury from the parole board panel told the hearing on Wednesday that it had heard statements by Peter's loved ones in private about their concerns about parole being granted.\"Those statements told the panel about the ongoing impact on the authors' of Peter's death and their concerns about Ms Connelly's potential release,\" Ms  Allbeury said.\"Each one has also requested in the event of Ms Connelly's release that certain conditions be put in place to protect them.\"We found these statements extremely moving.\"There can be no doubt that Peter's death has caused lifelong harm to those who loved him.\"Now in her 40s, Connolly was recalled to prison last year after breaching her licence conditions, having initially left prison in 2022 following a successful parole bid.The parole board ruled she was suitable for release in March that year - after hearing she was considered to be at \"low risk of committing a further offence\" and that probation officers and prison officials supported the plan.This was despite the panel highlighting concerns over Connelly's ability to manipulate and deceive, and hearing evidence of how she had become embroiled in prison romances and traded secret love letters with an inmate.Then-justice secretary Dominic Raab appealed against the decision, but a judge rejected his bid to keep her behind bars.She had previously been released on licence in 2013 but was recalled to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole conditions.Three previous parole bids, in 2015, 2017 and 2019, were rejected.Met PoliceTracey Connelly was jailed in 2009 for causing or allowing the death of her toddler son PeterPeter was found dead in his cot in 2007 following months of violent abuse by Connolly, her boyfriend Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen.Connelly had admitted the offence of causing or allowing the death of her son and was handed a sentence of imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of five years.Barker and Owen were convicted of the same crime.A series of reviews identified missed opportunities for officials to save Peter's life had they reacted properly to warning signs.Parole hearings are usually held in private, but a judge approved applications for Connelly's review to be heard in public, concluding \"there can be no doubt that there is a substantial public interest\" in the case.Metropolitan PoliceSteven Barker was jailed in 2009 after being convicted of causing or allowing Baby P's deathParole hearings are usually held in private, but a judge approved this to be heard in public because of \"substantial public interest\" in the case, described by the board as \"one of the most high-profile and devastating child protection failures in UK history\".More stories about Baby PRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesFood inflation fell, according to the latest figuresFood prices are increasing at their slowest rate in more than a year as inflation remained unchanged for the third month in a row.The UK inflation rate remained stable at 3.8% in September, which was lower than expected, official figures show.ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner noted that the cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks fell \"for the first time since May last year\" but the cost of items such as red meat and chocolate has continued to rise.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was overall \"not satisfied with the numbers\" on inflation, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was \"pushing up the cost of living\".Elaine Doran/BBCKayleigh Brannan said she has noticed the price of meat going upThe inflation rate for food and non-alcoholic drinks was down to 4.5% for the year to September from 5.1% in the year to August.It means prices for shoppers are still going up, just more slowly -  a small difference that might not always be easy to spot at the supermarket.Kayleigh Brannan, a mother to baby Hadley, told the BBC she had noticed the price of meat rising in particular, and that now Hadley has started eating solid foods, she expected her expenses would be going up.\"It's not too bad at the moment but you can see the prices going up,\" she said.She added:  \"The maternity pay is not enough. You've still got the same bills, you've still got to pay the mortgage… obviously you have more pressure then.\"Britain's inflation rate was also 3.8% in July and August, according to the ONS, which is still much higher than the Bank of England's 2% target.However, the central bank's economists had forecast inflation to rise to 4% in September.Mr Fitzner said: \"The largest upward drivers came from petrol prices and airfares, where the fall in prices eased in comparison to last year.\"He added: \"These were offset by lower prices for a range of recreational and cultural purchases including live events.\"Mr Fitzner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that food prices were still \"running quite high at 4.5%\" but added \"the fact that we have seen that steady increase dip a little is encouraging.\"\"It is just one month's numbers so we will have to see what transpires in future months - but nonetheless a small glimmer of hope there,\" he said.Paul Dales, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said while food price inflation could rise further, \"this will probably be the peak in inflation\".James Walton, chief economist at the Institute of Grocery Distribution said the declining rate of food and drink inflation \"aligns with our predictions that food inflation will start to moderate, and we may have seen the peak.\"\"Whilst this is good news, prices for shoppers are still going up year on year, just more slowly,\" he said.Mr Walton noted that items such as red meat, coffee and chocolate are still seeing strong price increases and linked this to issues with production, such as bad weather.Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, said: \"Staples like vegetables, milk, cheese and bread were all pared back a touch, though such tiny movements won't make a huge difference to the overall bill when people reach supermarket tills.\"Dr Kris Hamer, director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, said the figures were \"unlikely to raise consumer spirits as the cost of a weekly grocery shop was still \"significantly higher than last year\".\"Nonetheless, consumers will have been happy to see the price of key staples such as rice, bread and cereal fall on the month,\" he said.The chancellor said she was \"not satisfied with these numbers.\" \"For too long, our economy has felt stuck, with people feeling like they are putting in more and getting less out,\" Reeves said.She added that she was determined to ensure the government supports people \"struggling with higher bills and the cost of living challenges, deliver economic growth and build an economy that works for, and rewards, working people.\"In a post on X, the shadow chancellor said that inflation running at nearly double the Bank of England's target was \"pushing up the cost of living and punishing those Labour promised to protect\".Stride claimed national insurance increases, government borrowing and not having \"the backbone to reduce spending\" were all contributing to inflation.The overall inflation figure for September matters more than most other months. That's because the government usually uses this as the bench-mark for the benefits uprating in April. It means millions of people depending on benefits are likely to see a 3.8% increase in their payments next year.The state pension will rise by more, because the annual increase for that is determined by the so-called triple lock. This guarantees that the state pension goes up each year in line with either inflation, wage increases or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. September's inflation figure of 3.8% is below average earnings for the relevant period (4.8%)  which means the rise in wages will decide the state pension increase.The inflation figures for the past three months were the joint-highest recorded since January 2024, when the rate was 4%, according to the ONS.Inflation in the UK remains well below the 11.1% figure reached in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.More to this story",

    "body": "13 hours agoSean Farrington,Business presenter and Michael Sheils McNamee,Business reporterGetty ImagesThe head of global theme park giant Merlin Entertainments says its \"biggest competition\" is people choosing to stay at home on their phones and other devices. Fiona Eastwood says a day out at one of its UK attractions - which include Legoland, Thorpe Park and Alton Towers - was the \"perfect antidote\" for spiralling screen time. In a wide-ranging BBC Big Boss Interview, the chief executive reflected on challenges in the forthcoming Budget, big brand partnerships, and how its customers were responding to cost-of-living pressures.Eastwood also highlighted the importance of seasonal attractions to its customers - with Halloween now rivalling its summer season in driving profits at some attractions. Having been in the job since February, Eastwood has taken over at a time when her industry is facing challenges from a dip in consumer confidence. Her company's latest half-year update flagged concerns over a \"softening of demand\" in the UK theme park sector and fewer international visitors. Last year the company's overall revenue was down slightly to just over £2bn, with an operating loss of £132m. Despite the challenging environment, Merlin drew just shy of 63 million people to its attractions in 2024. Escapism was something people were willing to spend on, Eastood says.\"The moments to be together are increasingly precious, and what we provide is quite distinct,\" she says. \"It's all about families coming together to play.\"Getty ImagesFiona Eastwood said she was not a big fan of riding on Alton Towers' Nemesis roller coaster - and that the Wicker Man attraction was more here speed Talking about its UK attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life and the London Eye, Eastwood says seasonal windows are key.Its major theme parks have hosted Halloween events, like Scarefest at Alton Towers and Fright Nights at Thorpe Park, since 2002. \"We're a very seasonally led business,\" says Eastwood. \"So you have spring break, Easter, summer and Halloween. \"Halloween, that we're in now, we're seeing some really strong performance. That's in view of the amazing product we have. You take Thorpe Park, increasingly Halloween is almost half of its annual profits.\"Along with seasonal offerings, big brand partnerships are also a key part of Merlin Entertainments' strategy - creating rides themed around children's tv hits to tempt families away from their screens and into the parks.Next year it will open its first Bluey ride at Alton Towers as part of CBeebies land, as well as PAW Patrol land opening at Chessington World of Adventures. One of next year's biggest launches is a collaboration with video game Minecraft - an enduring mega hit since it was launched in 2009, spawning one of the highest grossing films of 2025.With Eastwood citing screen time as Merlin's toughest competition, it hopes an £85m investment in immersive experiences will attract Minecraft fans with themed rides, restaurants and accommodation in the UK and US during 2026 and 2027.\"What I'm really excited about in terms of Minecraft is bringing [the game] to life in a physical way that will mean the massive fans of that game can then be in the game with their friends, their parents,\" says Eastwood. Call for a VAT cut Eastwood is on the board of UK Hospitality, an industry trade body which has been calling for VAT on hospitality to be cut from 20% to 12.5%.\"What we really want is a growth-led Budget,\" says Eastwood. She adds that cutting VAT would put the UK on a \"level-playing field\" with its European neighbours - where hospitality businesses often face a rate of about 10%. Making the case for this, Eastwood pointed to a period during Covid when VAT was cut to 12.5%. \"We saw a bump, and we saw demand, and we saw people wanting to spend,\" she says.In a statement, the Treasury said the government was supporting all UK businesses and the upcoming Budget would aim to encourage growth and investment.\"We are a pro-business government that has capped corporation tax at 25%, the lowest rate in the G7, we're reforming business rates, have secured trade deals with the US, EU and India, and have seen interest rates cut five times since the election, benefiting businesses in every part of Britain.\"While Eastwood has been CEO for less than a year, her time with Merlin stretches back a decade, with her joining shortly after Alton Towers Smiler rollercoaster crash in 2015.Coming into the chief executive role, she says her focus was trying to take an \"outside view\" of the company - aware that she could have bias and blind spots. She adds one of the best parts of her role is getting out to visit the sites. \"Nothing beats going to the theme park, that is my job,\" she says. \"Spending time with the team, seeing kids having an amazing experience at our attractions.\" However, asked about getting to the front of the queue for Nemesis - the Alton Towers ride that is one of the best known in the country - Eastwood did not have any concrete advice, despite joining front-line workers on the ride last year. \"I'm not a big fan of Nemesis,\" she says. \"My favourite's actually Wicker Man, I love Wicker Man.\" ",

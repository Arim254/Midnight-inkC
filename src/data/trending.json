The car Marcus Fakana was travelling in crashed into a lorry while being pursued by policeAt the time of the fatal car crash, the Met Police said officers were attempting to stop a \"vehicle of interest\" in Pretoria Road, Tottenham, and after a short pursuit they temporarily lost sight of the car driven by Huseen.When officers then drove in to The Roundway, they found the vehicle had been involved in a crash.Fakana was taken to hospital and later died from his injuries.Huseen was remanded back into custody and a sentencing date will be set at a further hearing on 27 February.",

    "body": "A Canadian backpacker, who was found dead on an Australian beach and surrounded by a pack of dingoes earlier this week, likely died of drowning, an autopsy has found. Piper James, 19, had \"physical evidence consistent with drowning\" and \"injuries consistent with dingo bites\", a spokesperson for the Coroners Court of Queensland told BBC news.\"Pre-mortem dingo bite marks\" were unlikely to have caused her \"immediate death\", the spokesperson added. The autopsy was part of a preliminary assessment, and establishing her exact cause of death could take several weeks.Piper's body was found on a beach on K'Gari, an island off the eastern state of Queensland on Monday.In a statement to the BBC, the coroner also said there were \"extensive post-mortem dingo bite marks\" and that no evidence anyone else was involved.Piper's father, Todd James told Australia's 9News that the family felt relieved, as the autopsy results meant her body could be released back to her family in Canada.Her mother Angela told Global News that her daughter had always dreamed of travelling and had saved money for this trip after she graduated high school.Both parents had concerns about her travelling at her age, but Piper was determined.The teenager had been working at a backpacker's hostel for the past six weeks, and told friends she was going for a 05:00 morning swim on Monday, Australian media reported.Her body was found around 06:30 local time (20:30 GMT on Sunday).She was found near the Maheno shipwreck, which was washed ashore in 1935 and is now a popular tourist landmark.The area is known for its population of dingoes, a wild species of native dog that is protected in Queensland national parks.About 200 dingoes live on World Heritage-listed K'Gari, according to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHafizullah Maroof,BBC AfghanandFlora DruryA 22-year-old Afghan woman who was reportedly running a taekwondo gym for girls has been released after spending 13 days in jail, a spokesman for the Taliban's supreme court confirmed.Khadija Ahmadzada was detained for being in \"violation\" of rules \"regarding women's sports gyms\", a spokesman for the Taliban's ministry of vice and virtue told the BBC.Sports clubs have been closed to women since 2021, shortly after the Taliban returned to power.At the time, it was said they would reopen once a \"safe environment\" - which does not contravene the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law - had been established.As of January 2026, no sports club has reopened, while women are still unable to compete.It is one of a raft of measures that have been imposed on women by the Taliban since 2021, which have seen their rights to education and work curtailed as well as strict rules around clothing imposed.Ahmadzada, who lives near the western city of Herat, was detained with a number of other people after \"violations were observed\" by vice and virtue inspectors, the ministry spokesman said. She was accused of not wearing \"a proper hijab\", \"playing music\" and allowing genders to mix in her gym and sentenced to 13 days in jail. The spokesman said she had been given multiple warnings.The case was then referred to the supreme court, which announced she would be released on Thursday 22 January. It is unclear where she is now.News of Ahmadzada's arrest led to an outcry on social media, attracting the attention of Richard Bennett, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, who posted online calling for her immediate release.He also highlighted the case of female journalist Nazira Rashidi, in the northern city of Kunduz, who was detained in late December. Taliban spokesmen deny her detention is related to her work as a journalist, according to local media.",

While the watchmaker has not disclosed the price, industry collective Watchopea estimates its value at $1.5m (£1.1m, 137m rupees).The centre - branded as a private wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre - is home to more than 2,000 species, including lions, elephants and tigers, and is spread over 3,500 acres. The zoo, which is owned by Anant and is not open to the public, hit the headlines last year after allegations of unlawfully acquiring and mistreating animals, but a Supreme Court-appointed team later found no evidence of wrongdoing.AFP via Getty ImagesAnant Ambani and wife Radhika Merchant's pre-wedding bash was held at VantaraIt is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - which is the largest in the world.Vantara was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March last year.It was also one of the venues for Anant Ambani's lavish 2024 pre-wedding events that made global headlines.The wedding and other events were attended by all of India's top Bollywood stars and global celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.

It said the watch was made up of 397 precious stones, including diamonds, green sapphires, garnets and other gems.An executive associated with the brand's India retail partner Ethos Watches told the BBC that the company has not disclosed the price of the watch.

    "body": "27 minutes agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentGetty ImagesThe switch to CT scanners means clear transparent bags are no longer needed at the airportPassengers at Britain's biggest airport, Heathrow, can leave liquids in containers up to two litres in their bags while going through security, after it finally completed the rollout of new high-tech CT scanners.Electronics such as laptops can also be left in luggage, while clear plastic bags for liquids no longer have to be used.Heathrow now says it is the biggest airport in the world to have the new equipment fully rolled out across all its terminals.But while it has become the largest airport to roll out the new high-tech scanners, it is far from the UK's first, with Gatwick, Edinburgh and Birmingham airports having upgraded to them in recent years and increased to a two-litre limit.At most UK airports, passengers can keep liquid containers of up to 100ml in their luggage, without having to remove them and use clear plastic bags.Bristol and Belfast airports have also raised their liquid limits to two litres.However, other airports that have the new scanners installed are waiting for the green light from the Department for Transport (DfT) to raise the limit from 100ml.A recent report by consumer group Which? found that the sensitivity of the new scanners being rolled out means that at some airports, more bag searches end up being carried out by hand after passing through them. Heathrow said the scanners, which provide better images of cabin bags, could service \"thousands of passengers an hour with significantly greater efficiency, while maintaining high safety and security standards\".The rule change only applies to flights leaving Heathrow, and passengers must  check restrictions on luggage at the airports they are returning from before boarding flights to the UK. The rollout of the new high-tech scanners across the UK has suffered a series of setbacks over the past few years.Boris Johnson promised in 2019 that the rules about taking liquids through security in containers of no more than 100ml, inside plastics bags, would be scrapped by the end of 2022. The pandemic eventually put paid to that.In December 2022, the Conservative government promised state-of-the-art scanning equipment would be installed in security lanes by June 2024 in the \"biggest shake-up of airport security rules in decades\".Then-Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the dominance of \"tiny toiletry\" was nearly over.But, as it turned out, the June 2024 deadline was not achievable for the biggest airports - although a number of smaller ones, with fewer lanes to get sorted, did install the scanners in place before that date.Then, on the evening of Friday 13 June, 2024, the government said those smaller airports who had already introduced the new scanners and dropped their 100ml liquids rules, must reinstate them. This triggered anger among airport operators.The EU also announced a reversion to the 100ml rule in July that year. There has since been a period of inconsistency. Last summer, the Transport Secretary was telling passengers to assume the 100ml rule still applied.Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye said the £1bn package of upgrades would mean passengers could spend \"less time preparing for security and more time enjoying their journey\".Of the world's busiest 10 airports, Heathrow is the only one to have scrapped the 100ml rule for liquid containers on international flights. A DfT spokesperson said: \"Heathrow is the latest UK airport to complete its rollout of next-generation security equipment for passengers, helping ensure security checks remain robust and can be completed smoothly.\"Airports are responsible for the installation and operation of security equipment. \"Passengers should continue to check security requirements with airports before they travel and come prepared with liquids in containers no larger than 100ml in hand baggage unless advised otherwise.\"The Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of travel agents, said airports setting their own timelines on the lifting of the 100ml cap has \"led to confusion and frustration\" and passengers have been \"tripped up\".Chief executive Julia Lo Bue-Said said: \"We would urge UK airports to work collectively with the government to ensure there is clear messaging around the rules to avoid confusion and delays where possible.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaria CassidyandRachel Broome,BBC WalesTesla has been convicted at least 18 times and ordered to pay more than £20,000 for repeatedly failing to co-operate with UK police forces.The British arm of Elon Musk's electric car giant has faced multiple criminal court proceedings over the past two years linked to alleged road traffic offences.Tesla offers its vehicles on long-term leases, and in such a scenario the leasing company is typically the registered keeper of the car.Drivers of rented or company cars caught speeding have to be named before they can face prosecution and companies which fail to return paperwork to police can be prosecuted instead.Almost 4,000 defendants have been convicted in courts in England and Wales in the last two weeks for failing to identify the driver of a vehicle under police investigation, leading to fines ranging from £1 to £1,000.In one incident, South Wales Police wrote to Tesla Financial Services in a bid to identify the driver of a Tesla which had been speeding at 80mph (128km/h) on the M4 near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in July 2025.  Court papers show a Tesla company director, Becky Hodgson, pleaded guilty for the firm by email in late November, saying it had tried to enter the plea online but \"encountered a technical issue on the Online Plea Service portal\".Although the company admitted the criminal charge, Hodgson suggested in her email that it had complied with the police request, adding that its internal processes were followed and the nomination was sent via post.A conviction was handed out at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court on 6 January and ended in Tesla receiving a £1,000 fine, an order for £120 costs and a £400 victim surcharge. At least 18 convictions recorded against Tesla Financial Services have been identified by the Press Association since the start of 2024, including prosecutions brought by the Metropolitan Police, Hampshire Constabulary and Thames Valley Police.Seventeen cases have already been sentenced, while Tesla Financial Services pleaded guilty last week to failing to identify a driver. That case is set to be sentenced at a later date at Bath Magistrates' Court.In one of the concluded cases, a Tesla driver was caught on a speed camera doing almost 100mph (160km/h) on the A3 in Petersfield in Hampshire.But due to police letters going unanswered, the speeding driver was not identified and the company received a conviction with a fine instead.Another Tesla driver was caught speeding three times, potentially putting them on the cusp of a disqualification - if they had been identified.Letters from police which went unanswered have been addressed to Tesla Financial Services at offices and a service centre in London, as well as an office in Manchester.In the cases identified, fines, costs and court fees totalling £20,686 have been imposed by magistrates sitting in the single justice procedure, which deals with minor offences.Tesla have been asked to comment. South Wales Police have been asked to comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterGetty ImagesSir David Beckham, Lady Victoria Beckham, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and Nicola Peltz Beckham, pictured in 2023Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's wedding DJ has given his account of what happened during what he describes as an \"awkward\" dance between the groom and his mother Victoria.On Monday, Brooklyn almost broke the internet by posting a series of claims about his famous parents, Sir David and Lady Beckham, including that his mother hijacked his first dance with actress and hedge fund heiress Nicola Peltz.He claimed his mum, formerly one of the Spice Girls, had \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone\", leaving him feeling \"uncomfortable\" and \"humiliated\".DJ Fat Tony said \"the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room\".After rampant speculation over Brooklyn's comment about his mother's dancing, the DJ said: \"There was no slutdropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action.\"Pop star Marc Anthony performed at the wedding reception and called Brooklyn on to the stage, the DJ, whose real name is Tony Marnoch, told ITV's This Morning on Friday.\"The next minute, everyone was expecting it to be Nicola to go up and do the first dance,\" he said.The US singer then called for \"the most beautiful woman in the room\" to join Brooklyn - before saying Victoria's name instead of Nicola's.This led to the bride running out of the room in tears, Marnoch said.'Crying her eyes out'\"Victoria is by the stage, she goes onto the stage, and of course at that point Brooklyn is suddenly, literally, devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife.\"Then Nicola leaves the room crying her eyes out. Brooklyn is stuck there on stage.\"And then they do this dance and Marc Anthony's going, 'Put your hands on your mother's hips'. It was a Latin thing.\"The whole situation was very awkward for everyone in the room.\"However, his account differs from a report in British Vogue, who were at the wedding, and said it was Brooklyn who \"invited his mother on stage for a dance\".BBC News has contacted Anthony, who is a singer-songwriter and friend of the Beckhams, for a comment.Sir David and Lady Beckham have not directly responded to Brooklyn's post or given their side of the story.Getty ImagesDJ Fat Tony, whose real name is Tony Marnoch, is known for his work on the celebrity-packed London club scene in the 1980s and 90sMarnoch has DJ'd at \"an awful lot of Beckham parties in the past\", and they are a \"close-knit family\" who \"love to dance\", he said.Whether that dance was \"inappropriate\" is down to how Brooklyn feels, he said.\"This is all about how Brooklyn feels. If he feels that it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward.\"The following day's brunch was \"the most awkward part of it all\" because \"everything that had gone on at the wedding night was discussed amongst the guests the next morning\", the DJ said.He added that the newlyweds left \"devastated\", but said the dance \"is a very small part of a bigger problem\" for the feuding family.It's \"sad\" that many people have focused on that part of Brooklyn's statement, Marnoch said.Mock-ups and memes of Lady Beckham's supposed wedding dance have been flooding the internet all week.\"It's taken a lot for someone to go to social media to post it,\" he added.\"He wanted to change the narrative. For all of his life he's been called a nepo baby, and 'He should be grateful that he's got the family name'.\"That's what he was born into. I think what we're all missing here is the fact that parents have lost their child, and a son's lost his parents and the rest of his family.\"In his explosive Instagram post on Monday, Brooklyn said he did not want to \"reconcile\" with his family, citing further wedding dress drama and an accusation that his parents put \"brand Beckham\" first.",

    "body": "7 hours agoImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentandOttilie MitchellThe US has officially withdrawn from the World Health Organization (WHO), leaving the UN agency without one of its biggest donors.US President Donald Trump signed an executive order signalling the withdrawal a year ago, having criticised the organisation for being too \"China-centric\" during the Covid pandemic.The US Department of Health and Human Services said it took the decision due to the WHO's alleged \"mishandling\" of the pandemic, an inability to reform and political influence from member states.The WHO has rejected these claims and its director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the withdrawal was as a loss for the US and the world.The organisation pointed to its global efforts to combat polio, HIV aids, maternal mortality, and its international treaty on tobacco control.In the wake of the pandemic, WHO member states worked to create an international pandemic treaty designed to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics, including sharing vaccines and drugs more fairly.The treaty was finally agreed in April last year by all WHO member states, apart from the US.Washington has traditionally been one of the biggest donors to the WHO, but has not paid its fees for 2024 and 2025, which has already caused huge job losses at the organisation.Although WHO lawyers suggest the US is obliged to pay the arrears - estimated at $260m (£193m) - Washington said it saw no reason to do so.It said that all US government funding to the WHO has been terminated, US personnel and contractors have been recalled from the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and its offices worldwide, and hundreds of US engagements with WHO have been suspended or discontinued.\"The WHO tarnished and trashed everything that America has done for it,\" a joint statement from US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy and Secretary of State Marco Rubio read.The pair said the organisation had \"abandoned its core mission and acted repeatedly against the interests of the United States\", including failing to return the American flag based at its Geneva headquarters.\"Going forward, U.S. engagement with the WHO will be limited strictly to effectuate our withdrawal and to safeguard the health and safety of the American people,\" they added.The US department said it would have bilateral relations with other countries to ensure disease surveillance and pathogen sharing, but were unable to provide information about which specific countries they had such links with so far.In response to a question about global efforts to combat polio or HIV, officials said the US would partner with \"NGOs and faith based groups\" to continue that work, but could not give details of any partnerships yet established.Asked whether the US would continue to participate in information sharing for and development of the annual global flu vaccine, officials were not sure.After Trump signed the withdrawal order at the start of his second term, the WHO wrote that it hoped the US would reconsider, and said the \"WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats\".Its reconsideration would have been for the \"benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe\", it concluded.The WHO said on Friday that the US withdrawal was on the agenda for its upcoming board meeting from 2-7 February.It told the BBC that its secretariat will act according to the advice from the governing bodies.Pandemic responses by many countries with highly developed health services - including the US but also the UK - have been criticised as slow and flawed.Many governments hesitated to impose lockdowns, fearing their citizens would not accept such restrictions.In the wake of the pandemic, studies have shown that the delay contributed to the rapid spread of the virus.The US had one of highest death rates in part because of a patchy response to WHO advice on mask wearing and social distancing, according to Drew Altman, a former US public health official.In a 2020 article for the BMJ,  he accused the federal administration in Washington, then led by Trump, of failing to offer national guidance, and allowing policy over Covid-19 to become politicised, with democrat run states mandating mask wearing, while Republican states abandoned social distancing and permitted mass gatherings. \"The disappointing US response to Covid-19 has been because of a failure of policy and leadership,\" said Altman.A research paper published in the UN National Library of Medicine also examined the US response to Covid-19, and accused the Trump administration of a \"slow and mismanaged federal response\".",

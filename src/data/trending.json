From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

    "body": "At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides.The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage.The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP.The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other.Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said.Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam.Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: \"Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud.\"Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days.Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",

    "body": "16 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoDearbail JordanUK Ministry of DefenceA view from HMS Severn as it tracks Russia's RFN Stoikiy in the English ChannelTwo Russian warships were intercepted in the English Channel by the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.In the latest incident involving Russia's ships entering waters around the UK, HMS Severn headed off the RFN Stoikiy, a corvette and Yelnya, a tanker, as they sailed west through the Dover Strait into the English Channel in the past fortnight.Last week, it emerged that the Russian spy ship Yantar was spotted off the coast of Scotland and it used lasers to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its movements.Defence Secretary John Healey branded the Yantar's move \"deeply dangerous\" and warned Russia and its president Vladimir Putin: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. We are ready.\"Healey said last week that there had been a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.The MoD said after intercepting the Stoikiy and the Yelnya, the HMS Severn later handed over monitoring duties to a Nato ally off the coast of Brittany, north west Fr.It said the UK ship \"continued to observe from a distance and remained ready to respond to any unexpected activity\".It is not the first time the Stoikiy has been in British territory.In May, the Royal Navy dispatched two vessels and the 814 Naval Air Squadron - also known as the \"flying tigers\" - to shadow the Russian warship as it sailed west through the English Channel to meet the Sparta IV and General Skobelev.The two merchant vessels were returning from the Mediterranean and the group headed back to the Baltic Sea, watched by HMS Hurworth.Healey has said that the rise in Russian activity in UK waters was evidence of increased \"Russian aggression right across the board\" which he says is impacting Europe, not just Ukraine.At a news conference in Downing Street last week, the defence secretary said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".Built in 2002, HMS Severn is a River-class offshore patrol vessel. Together with her sister ships, HMS Tyne and HMS Mersey, the Royal Navy says the ships are able to \"escort passing foreign warships, mount fishing vessel inspections and defend the UK border\".",

    "body": "A Renaissance painting found underneath a garage workbench has sold for more than half a million pounds at an auction house in Banbury.In a 15-minute bidding battle at JS Fine Art auctioneers, a painting depicting the Madonna and Child went for £685,000. The painting is believed to be by Renaissance painter Pietro Vannucci, known as Perugino (1450–1523). Joe Smith, founder and principal auctioneer at JS Fine Art, said: \"It was one of those moments every auctioneer dreams of. We knew it was special, but the response was beyond anything we expected.\"The painting was purchased by a private collector, whose identity remains undisclosed, and taken to a fine art conservator.Perugino was one of the most influential artists of the Italian Renaissance. In his early life he was considered to be equal to Leonardo da Vinci, and was commissioned to paint the walls of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Palace in Rome.\"The longer you looked, the more you realised the quality of the workmanship and the elegance of the Renaissance detailing,\" added Mr Smith.\"When the hammer fell, there was a hush — then applause.\"The sale set a new record for JS Fine Art, whose previous house record was £265,000.

A PSA test looks for proteins associated with prostate cancer and the result was high in Lord Cameron's case.He was treated with focal therapy, which targets the area where the tumour is present using methods such as ultrasound waves to destroy cancer cells.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with around 55,000 new cases every year.Lord Cameron told the newspaper he wanted to use his platform to support a call by Prostate Cancer Research, a charity which counts Mr Jones - founder of private members' club chain Soho House - as a trustee, for screening to be offered to high-risk men.The cancer is most common in older age - among men over 75. Cases in the under-50s are rare. It is also more common in black men.\"I don't particularly like discussing my personal intimate health issues, but I feel I ought to,\" Lord Cameron said.\"Let's be honest. Men are not very good at talking about their health. We tend to put things off.\"But he said: \"I sort of thought, well, this has happened to you, and you should lend your voice to it.\"Lord Cameron, prime minister between 2010 and 2016 and later foreign secretary in Rishi Sunak's government, told the Times: \"I would feel bad if I didn't come forward and say that I've had this experience. I had a scan. It helped me discover something that was wrong. It gave me the chance to deal with it.\"There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.But the peer's intervention comes days after a major prostate cancer screening trial began in the country. It is aimed at finding the best way to detect the disease.Around one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lives, according to Prostate Cancer UK, with research showing it has overtaken breast cancer as the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease in the UK.",

I'd also say the media frankly. And I think we need to acknowledge that.\"The PM also said he would \"absolutely\" like to welcome the former Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner back into government at some point.Rayner, who was housing secretary as well as Sir Keir's deputy, resigned in September after failing to pay enough tax when she bought a flat in Hove in East Sussex.Twice referring to her as \"Ange,\" he told reporters: \"I'm friends with Ange and I like Ange a lot and we talk a lot. We still do. It's always good to have Angela.\"\"I've always said I want Angela back. Even back in September, at the time, I said she is going to be a big voice in the Labour movement,\" he said. \"But do I want Angela back at some stage? Yes absolutely.\"He added: \"I think she is the best example ever in the United Kingdom of social mobility - going from a pretty challenging childhood to being deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom. \"She is the story of social mobility above all other stories.\"In an interview last weekend, Rayner did not rule out a return to frontline politics, telling the Daily Mirror she had not \"gone away\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president convicted of plotting a coup, has blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to his ankle monitor - a day after he was removed from house arrest into detention.At a hearing in Brasília, he admitted trying to open the monitor with a soldering iron on Friday until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing.Officials say the right-wing politician, 70, was taken into custody because he was a flight risk ahead of a supporters' vigil outside his home. He will remain in detention.In September, Bolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for the coup plot.Bolsonaro is being held in a police station in the capital.His legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.Bolsonaro was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Supreme Court justices said that he had known of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.",

    "body": "A Ukrainian refugee has become the first person from his country to win an elite-level sumo tournament.Danylo Yavhusishyn - known by his sumo ring name Aonishiki - arrived in Japan as an 18-year-old in 2022 after the Russian invasion of his country.Now aged 21, he is the first Ukrainian to claim the prized Emperor's Cup and the first European in almost eight years to do so.He is now on the verge of being promoted to the second-highest rank of Ozeki, in what would be the fastest promotion in history.Aonishiki finished the 15-day tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, with a record of 12 wins and three losses and went on to win the championship play-off against Yokozuna grand champion Hoshoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian who won last month's London tournament.In his winning ceremony interview, Aonishiki was asked if he felt satisfied with his results after three years in sumo.\"No, I think this is just the beginning,\" he replied.The name Aonishiki contains the Japanese character for \"blue\" - a reference to the Ukrainian flag.Aonishiki is only the second Ukrainian in the top division in sumo. He first tried sumo aged seven, after also practicing judo and freestyle wrestling.He impressed in youth amateur sumo competitions, and fled to Germany with his family after Russia's invasion.He moved to Japan by himself in April 2022, without knowing the language, with the help of a university sumo club captain he met previously at a youth championship event.Despite only being in professional sumo for a short time, he has gained fans in Japan and worldwide with his impressive skills, constant improvement and competitiveness.He often defeats opponents with seldom-used techniques, receiving praise from both professionals and sumo enthusiasts.Aonishiki, who was one of the most cheered wrestlers at last month's Grand Sumo Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is tipped by many to become the first-ever European to reach sumo's highest rank of Yokozuna grand champion.",

    "body": "A \"tremendous amount of progress\" has been achieved in talks to finalise a US-proposed peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said.But \"there's still some work to be done\", Rubio said after meeting Ukrainian and European negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were \"signals that President [Donald] Trump's team is hearing us\". Ukraine and its European allies had expressed concern over the leaked proposals, seen as favouring Russia and welcomed by Vladimir Putin as \"the basis\" for settlement. Zelensky had said Ukraine \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\".Speaking to reporters late on Sunday, Rubio said the negotiating teams in Geneva had had a \"very good day\".He said the main goal had been to try to narrow \"open items\" from the 28-point US plan - and the parties involved had achieved that in a \"substantial way\".However, America's top diplomat added that any final agreement would have to be agreed by the Ukrainian and US presidents - before the package was sent to Russia -  and that there were still a couple of issues they need to continue to work on.A joint US-Ukraine statement issued later on Sunday said that an \"updated and refined peace framework\" had been agreed by both countries, and that they agreed to \"intensive work on joint proposals in the coming days\".Several media outlets reported they had seen an alternative plan from Kyiv's European allies led by the UK, France and Germany. The BBC has not seen the document and Rubio denied any knowledge of its existence. Earlier on Sunday, Trump accused Ukraine's leaders of showing \"zero gratitude\" for US efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.The US president also pointed out that Europe - where Kyiv has some of its staunchest allies - was continuing to buy oil from Russia.Moscow relies heavily on its oil and gas exports to continue financing its war in Ukraine.The Geneva talks are focusing on the US draft, the leaked version of which includes a Ukrainian troop withdrawal from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and the de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region in addition to the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US plan also limits Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel - from about 880,000 now.The draft crucially includes a pledge for Ukraine not to seek membership of Nato. Instead, Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\" about which no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and its troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line, despite reported heavy losses.Trump has given Ukraine until this coming Thursday to agree the proposals. But he then said this was not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukraine's allies from Europe, Canada and Japan voiced concerns.And Rubio told reporters on Sunday he was \"very optimistic that we're going to get there in a very reasonable period of time very soon\", whether it was Thursday, other days, or Monday the following week.",

    "body": "55 minutes agoAnnabel Rackham,Culture reporter and Ian Youngs,Culture reporterGetty ImagesSenior figures involved in the BBC's recent troubles will be questioned by MPs on Monday.Michael Prescott - a former editorial adviser who raised concerns about BBC reporting, including Panorama's edit of a Donald Trump speech - will speak on the matter in public for the first time when he appears in front of a House of Commons committee.An internal memo written by Prescott was leaked to the press, leading to the resignations of the BBC's director general and head of news earlier this month.Also giving evidence will be BBC chairman Samir Shah, who is under pressure for his handling of the affair, and fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson.'Governance issues'Caroline Daniel, another former editorial adviser, will also speak to parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee from 15:30 GMT.They are expected to face tough questions from MPs, and to give their views on the state of the BBC and its journalism, and give their accounts of events behind the scenes. On Friday, one board member, Shumeet Banerji, resigned over what he called \"governance issues\" at the top of the corporation, which BBC media editor Katie Razzall said \"looks like a direct critique of\" Shah.Banerji's departure makes Monday's committee hearing \"even more critical\" for Shah, Razzall added.The role of Sir Robbie, a former BBC senior editor and director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, is also expected to come under  scrutiny.BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness resigned following criticism after Prescott's memo was reported by the Telegraph.In a subsequent letter to the parliamentary committee, Shah apologised for the \"error of judgement\" when two sections of Trump's speech on 6 January 2021 were edited together in an episode of Panorama.Prescott's memo also raised concerns about other \"troubling matters\" including \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, and one-sided coverage of trans issues.The committee's chairwoman, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, has said Davie's departure was \"regrettable\" but that \"restoring trust in the corporation must come first\".She said: \"The BBC Board must now begin the long process of rebuilding the corporation's reputation both at home and abroad, after the damage caused by what has become a seemingly constant stream of crises and missteps.\"Political influence 'a concern'The latest crisis has sparked a wider debate about the future of the BBC and the state of its news output, including claims of institutional bias and political interference.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said the perception of political influence is \"a problem\", and that there is \"a real concern, which I share, that political appointments to the board of the BBC damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality\".She pledged to examine the issue as part of the corporation's next charter review.Sir Robbie was appointed to the BBC board by the Conservative government in 2021, and has been accused of interfering in editorial decisions.He sits on the BBC board's editorial guidelines and standards committee (EGSC) alongside Shah, Davie and Thomson, who is the BBC's former chief operating officer.The parliamentary committee said Monday's session would focus on the EGSC's \"processes and how it ensures output complies with the BBC's editorial guidelines\".Prescott, a former Sunday Times political editor, and Daniel, a former FT assistant editor, advised the EGSC about \"editorial risks and issues\" after being appointed as the BBC's first \"external editorial experts\" in 2022.The session comes as the BBC waits to discover whether Trump will file legal action after threatening to sue the corporation for between $1bn (£759.8m) and $5bn (£3.8bn) over the Panorama edit.",

    "body": "The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued two amber health alerts for parts of the country as cold weather is set to ring in the new year.The alerts, which warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people, cover the North East and North West of England from 20:00 GMT on Sunday to 12:00 on 5 January. Temperatures in these regions are expected to fall to around -4C, with snow predicted in the North West on 3 and 4 January. The low temperatures are likely to affect health and care services, the agency added.Overnight into Monday, temperatures are expected to fall to as low as -1C in Penrith, while -10C is possible in parts of the Scottish Highlands.Other consequences of very cold weather include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, the UKHSA said.Staffing issues, due to travel delays, may also arise from the cold spell. Most of England will be cloudy overnight, and there will be patches of frost and fog which could mean \"tricky travelling conditions\" on Monday morning, the forecaster said.Between 2 and 11 January, cold northerly winds in Scotland are expected to become dominant across the UK, bringing snow showers mainly to coastal areas that will work south, the Met Office said. Inland locations across central and southern areas will remain mostly dry but cold.On Friday, temperatures in the the North East and North West will feel colder due to the wind chill - a temperature of -4C could feel more like -8C, the Met Office said. The agency also issued less serious yellow cold health alerts for the rest of England, covering the East Midlands, West Midlands, South East, South West, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and London.Temperatures in areas covered by the yellow warning are expected to fall to around highs of 6C and lows below freezing from New Year's Day.Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said it was \"vital\" to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are vulnerableThe predicted temperatures can have a \"serious impact\" on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions, he warned. Cold health alerts and weather warnings were issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, forcing several annual open water swimming events to be cancelled. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoHarry SekulichWatch: Stranded passengers walk past derailed train as wounded are carried from carriagesAt least 13 people died and almost 100 were injured after a train derailed in Mexico's south-western Oaxaca region, the Mexican navy said.The train, which was travelling between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, was carrying 241 passengers and nine crew members.A total of 98 were injured, of whom 36 were being treated in hospital, the navy said. The train derailed as it rounded a bend near the town of Nizanda, officials said. Mexico's Attorney General confirmed an investigation was under way.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said five of those injured were in a serious condition. She said top level officials, including the Secretary of the Navy, were travelling to the site of the crash.Photos from the site of the crash showed rescue workers helping passengers alight the train, which had fallen off the rail tracks and partly tilted over the side of a cliff.The Interoceanic train, which connects the Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast, had two locomotives and four passenger cars, the navy said. Mexico's navy operates the country's railway network.The Governor of Oaxaca Salomón Jara Cruz expressed \"deep regret\" over the accident in a statement and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.The Interoceanic rail link was inaugurated two years ago to boost the region's economy, an initiative spearheaded by former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Designed to modernise the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Mexican government has sought to develop the area into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure.The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.",

    "body": "16 hours agoFiona NimoniGetty ImagesJojo Moyes revealed Sophie Kinsella's support to the Desert Island Discs showThe late author Sophie Kinsella convinced fellow writer Jojo Moyes to complete her bestselling romance novel Me Before You. Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes has credited Kinsella with inspiring her to keep going, when she nearly gave up on the book after writing 20,000 words. It became an international bestseller and was adapted for the 2016 film starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022 and died earlier this month at the age of 55.  Author Sophie Kinsella remembered as a 'wonderful, warm woman'Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes described how she almost abandoned writing her bestselling novel because she was feeling depressed after years of little commercial success. She said: \"I met up with my friend Sophie Kinsella and had lunch with her and I was broke at the time and I was feeling quite depressed because I thought my writing career was coming to an end.\"I told her the story of my 20,000 words over lunch and she just looked at me, and she said, 'You have to write this book, you do know that? You have to write this book'.\"When I got home, her husband, Henry, called me up and said, 'Jojo, Maddy... told me about this book and I think you should write it too'.\"I love her for many reasons, but that's one of them.\"The Me Before You series follows the life of Louisa Clark, a working-class girl who ends up as a carer for paraplegic Will Traynor, a wealthy man who is paralysed after a motorcycle accident.The book was based on a news story Moyes had seen about a young rugby player who had been left quadriplegic after an accident and persuaded his parents to take him to a Swiss assisted dying clinic. \"I knew I loved this book and I knew it was the best version of itself that it could be, but I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way that it did,\" she told Laverne. The full interview is available to listen to on BBC Sounds. Getty ImagesSophie Kinsella was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022",

    "body": "3 hours agoSenior Labour MPs have called for Sir Keir Starmer to strip Egyptian dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah of his British citizenship, the Times reports. The prime minister's \"failure to conduct background checks\" on Fattah, who was freed from prison in Egypt and welcomed in the UK, has been widely criticised. Historical social media messages emerged of the British-Egyptian activist calling for Zionists to be killed. Ministers in private have called Starmer's intervention \"ridiculous\" and \"shocking\", according to the Times. The Daily Telegraph spotlights the pressure mounting on Sir Keir to revoke the citizenship of the man its headline labels as an \"extremist\". According to the Telegraph, Mr Fattah did not go through \"good character\" checks for his citizenship \"because of a loophole created by the European Convention on Human Rights\". The Tory leader's fury over the prime minister welcoming a \"freed anti-Semitic Egyptian dissident\" takes centre position in the Daily Mail's reporting. Kemi Badenoch declares: \"I do not want people who hate Britain coming to our country\", and calls for Abdel Fattah to be \"booted out\" of the UK.An image of Brigitte Bardot is draped across the top of the Sun's front page with the headline writer deploying the words \"And God created Bardot\" in reference to her iconic 1956 movie And Got Created Woman. The paper leads on its report on the weekend wedding between Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay, daugher of the TV chef Gordon - whose \"father of the bride speech\" is described as \"explosive\" by the Sun, with its reference to a reported ongoing ongoing feud in the Peaty family. The Daily Star also makes the same headline tribute to \"screen goddess\" Bardot, who has died aged 91, again referring to the movie role that catapulted the French actress into superstardom. Writer Emily Hall is evocative in her descriptions of the \"Fifties blonde bombshell\" and \"movie sex kitten\".The Daily Mirror remembers the late French actress as \"La Belle Bardot\". An image of the \"screen legend\" with her iconic blonde tousled hair and black eyeliner, while posing in just a towel, takes up the entire front page.A young Bardot also takes up nearly half of the Guardian front page, but its accompanying report highlights that in her later years she turned her back on film stardom and \"embraced animal rights activism\". In its lead story, the US President has said war talks for Ukraine are in their \"final stages, as Trump sat down last night for a meeting in Florida with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In an exclusive with the i Paper, a co-creator of the Novichock nerve agent alleges the Kremlin \"may be developing even deadlier weapons\". The interview comes amid Trump and Zelensky's latest negotiations for a peace deal. The Financial Times names \"Silicon Valley's hottest start-ups\", which have raised a record $150bn to protect themselves from AI investment going bust. The paper says they have built \"fortress balance sheets\" against the chance of an AI investment downturn.The Daily Express runs an exclusive on new care home inspection plans putting \"thousands of residents at risk\". The proposed overhaul could mean services only undergo full checks every 10 years, according to the paper.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "4 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Trump says progress made in Ukraine talks but 'thorny issues' remainThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "More than 300 earthquakes were recorded in the UK in 2025, British Geological Survey data shows.The two largest earthquakes occurred just hours apart near Loch Lyon in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, when a 3.7 magnitude tremor was registered on 20 October, followed by one of 3.6. Up to 18 December 2025, 309 earthquakes had been recorded across the UK. Areas of Perthshire and the western Highlands in Scotland, southern parts of Wales, and Yorkshire and Lancashire in England recorded the most seismic activity overall. On average, the UK experienced an earthquake \"almost once a day\" in 2025, seismologist Brian Baptie said.The report said 34 earthquakes in total occurred near Loch Lyon between October and December. \"The west of Scotland is one of the more active parts of the UK,\" Dr Baptie said.Some of this can be attributed to geological faults including the Great Glen and the Highland Boundary Fault.\"By contrast, north-east Scotland experiences very few earthquakes.\"Two minor earthquakes hit Lancashire in as many weeks in December, with the epicentre of the 2.5 magnitude tremor located off the coast of Silverdale, in Morecambe Bay.The BGS confirmed the quake was an aftershock of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake which hit the area at the start of December.Seismic activity is recorded by 80 monitoring stations around the UK, operated by BSG.It said the UK experiences between 200 and 300 earthquakes a year but only about 20 or 30 are felt or heard by people.This year, it received 1,320 reports from members of the public who felt tremors this year.A magnitude-four event in the UK and surrounding areas is typically recorded every three to four years, and a magnitude-five event happens every few decades - with the most recent one in 2008 in Lincolnshire.A magnitude-six earthquake happens every few hundred years. The largest known earthquake in the UK occurred in 1931, near the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea off the coast of Yorkshire.It had a magnitude of 6.1 and was powerful enough to cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England, despite its epicentre being 60 miles offshore.In general, earthquakes are caused by the tectonic plates that make up the earth moving and rubbing together. Smaller earthquakes, including those experienced in the UK, can be caused by movements on geological faults in the Earth's crust.The UK is situated within the Eurasian plate, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the nearest plate boundary. This is why it does not experience earthquakes as large as those in other parts of the world.",

    "body": "The Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won a landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results. With 90% of the votes counted, the party, whose name means \"self determination\", was on 50.8%, meaning a third term in power for its leader, Albin Kurti. The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were on 20.98% and 13.89%, respectively.Vetevendosje won elections in February, but without a majority, and Kosovo has been without a functioning government since then. The impasse meant there was one big question hanging over this second parliamentary election of the year. Would voters punish Kurti for the long months of deadlock in the country's National Assembly – or the opposition parties who refused to countenance a coalition with Kurti's left-wing movement?The electorate has given a clear answer. This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterMany in the UK who unwrapped a new drone this Christmas may face a rude awakening next week, when they will have to take a theory test before being allowed to fly outdoors.From 1 January, those intending to fly drones or model aircraft weighing 100g or more outside must complete a Civil Aviation Authority (CCA) online theory test to get a Flyer ID - something previously only needed for heavier drones.The regulator believes up to half a million people in the UK may be impacted by its new requirements.CAA spokesperson Jonathan Nicholson said with drones becoming a \"common Christmas present\" it was important people knew how to comply with the law.\"With the new drone rules coming into force this week, all drone users must register, get a Flyer ID and follow the regulations,\" he said.\"We want people to enjoy their drones but it's vital that they have checked the new rules and know how and where to operate their drone safely before they fly.\"The CAA's requirements are based on the weight or class of drones and model aircraft.Where previously a Flyer ID was only required for devices weighing 250g or more, it will soon be required to fly a drone weighing 100g or more outdoors.In addition to completing a theory test to obtain a five year Flyer ID license, those who own a drone weighing 100g or more with a camera must also register with the CAA to get an Operator ID.According to the CAA, the new rules are designed to be easier to understand, as well as allow for \"safe expansion\" of drones across the UK.Its requirements also apply to children, but vary for different age groups. Children under the age of 13 must obtain a Flyer ID and have a parent or guardian present when completing the free flyer theory test to get one.Meanwhile those aged 12 or younger must be supervised by someone over 16 to fly drones, with parents also required to obtain an Operator ID.The CAA also wants existing drone owners and ID holders to acquaint themselves with the rules, which sets out where drones should not be flown and how to protect peoples' privacy when piloting those equipped with cameras.It says flying a drone or model aircraft without necessary IDs is against the law, and punishable by fines or, in severe cases, with prison sentences.But Dr Alan McKenna, a law lecturer at the University of Kent, said effective enforcement would likely be \"a case of resources\".He told the BBC while he believed most people would seek to abide by new UK requirements for flying drones outdoors, some may look to \"fly under the radar\".\"You're always going to get people who make mistakes or can't be bothered,\" Dr McKenna said - adding concerns about the impact of rising drone use on the environment, privacy and safety were \"wider issues\" at play.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington DCandHarry SekulichDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky said progress had been made to end the Ukraine war during Florida talks but the US president admitted the problem of territory remained \"unresolved\".While both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the talks as \"great\", Trump said \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained outstanding - most notably on the issue of land.Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of the 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done.Zelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\"We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,\" Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.A proposal to turn the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russia largely controls, into a demilitarised zone remains \"unresolved\", Trump said.\"Some of that land has been taken,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months.\"Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas.Russia wants Ukraine to pull back from the small part of the territory it still controls in Donbas, while Kyiv has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces.The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course.\"[That] is a very tough issue,\" he said. \"One that will get resolved.\"Security guarantees for Ukraine are \"95% done\", Trump said, without formally committing to logistical support or troop deployment to help protect Ukraine from future attacks.Trump floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\".While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.Earlier Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the US president did not offer many details of the phone call, he said he believed the Russian leader \"wants Ukraine to succeed\".At the same time, Trump acknowledged that Moscow had little interest in a ceasefire that would allow Ukraine to hold a referendum.\"I understand that position,\" he added.Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said the call was initiated by Trump and that he and Putin discussed the latest EU and Ukraine proposals to end the war.Ushakov, Russia's former US ambassador, said Trump listened to the Kremlin's assessment of the proposals and the two presidents left the call united in their belief that a temporary ceasefire proposed by the EU and Ukraine would instead prolong the conflict.Zelensky suggested the Ukrainian officials could meet at the White House in January, potentially alongside European leaders, as the US and Ukrainian delegations finalise plans for further talks.In a post-meeting call with European allies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed \"good progress\" in the Florida talks while reinforcing the need for Ukraine to receive \"ironclad security guarantees from day one\".French President Emmanuel Macron also said Kyiv's allies would meet in Paris next month to discuss security guarantees.\"We will bring together the countries of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris in early January to finalise each one's concrete contributions,\" Macron said on X after speaking with Zelensky and Trump.",

    "body": "16 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterAn evening surge in shoppers keen on Boxing Day bargains drove a decade-high increase in footfall for the annual sales, figures suggest.It was up by 4.4% across all UK retail destinations including high streets and shopping centres compared to the same day last year, according to data from MRI Software.Footfall also remained strong on Saturday, and MRI anticipated the strong post-Christmas shopping momentum to continue into the new year.But higher footfall does not necessarily translate into higher spending, and Barclays has forecast that consumers would spend £1bn less on this year's Boxing Day deals.By 3pm on 26 December, it appeared there had been a muted reaction to the sales, according to early MRI data with high street visits down 1.5% compared to 2024 and shopping centre visits down 0.6%.MRI counts footfall in more than 660 retail locations across the UK and retail analyst Jenni Matthews said that as the day progressed, it became clear that shoppers were deciding to head out but just a bit later in the day.\"The boost in activity was driven by a peak in visits across all UK retail destinations from 5pm - 11pm averaging +9.6% versus an average increase of +3.1% from 6am-5pm,\" she said.With many stores not reopening until 28 December, Ms Matthews said it was likely that hospitality and leisure venues would have benefited from the increase in foot traffic.\"This is an early indicator that the retail sector may well end the year on a positive note given the challenging times faced at the beginning of the year,\" she said.Shoppers were also out in force on Saturday, according to the MRI data, with footfall across retail destinations up by 1.6% compared to 27 December last year.Ms Matthews said that with family gatherings ending and the new year looming, MRI anticipates footfall will continue to rise over the coming days.\"Consumers [will be] likely shopping the sales, making the most of the festive events and attractions within towns and cities, and stocking up on New Year's Eve essentials, keeping the festive retail period firmly in motion,\" she said.Analysts say 2025 has been a challenging year for people as rising prices and other factors have squeezed household finances.Barclays' consumer spend report suggested that fewer people planned to take advantage of the sales, forecasting shoppers to spending £3.6bn, down from £4.6bn last year.Recent retail spending data from the Office for National Statistics showed that many shoppers resisted the lure of November's Black Friday sales, with only a 0.1% lift in sales volumes.",

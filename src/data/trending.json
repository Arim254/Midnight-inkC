    "body": "A staff member who was working at the Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught alight, her family's lawyer has alleged.Cyane Panine, 24, died in the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans Montana and was widely identified in a video wearing a helmet and holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached when the ceiling caught fire.The bar's French owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Forty people were killed and 116 were injured in the blaze in southwest Switzerland.Pope Leo XIV met relatives of some of those killed in the disaster on Thursday and said he was \"very moved and distraught\" to talk to them at the Vatican. \"Where can one find a consolation equal to what you are experiencing?\" he asked.Sophie Haenni, the lawyer representing Cyane Panine's family, told the BBC she \"wasn't supposed to be serving tables\" on the night of the fire but had been asked to go downstairs to help manage high demand for bottles. \"It wasn't Cyane herself who decided to put on this helmet, it was at the request of her employers. She was just doing her job.\" It is shocking to place the responsibility for their own failings on Cyane, a 24-year-old woman and their own employee\".Ms Haenni added that Cyane Panine had never been informed \"of the ceiling's danger and received no safety training\".A source who has seen the inquiry documents said that Jessica Moretti told investigators they had used sparklers in champagne bottles for the past 10 years. \"It wasn't the first time she'd done it, putting herself on someone else's shoulders,\" Ms Moretti told them. \"She did it on her own initiative.\"In a statement, Sophie Haenni said the casualties \"could have been avoided\" if \"safety standards (particularly regarding materials) had been followed and the required inspections carried out\". She added: \"Cyane is undoubtedly a victim.\" The Panine family's lawyers also say she \"felt used\" and was \"suffering from her working conditions\".\"[Cyane Panine] expressed her incomprehension at the lack of empathy and understanding from her employers\" in regards to her workload, the statement adds.\"My clients have lost their daughter, their sister. A loved one, a wonderful person, has been stolen from them,\" the statement says.The BBC has contacted lawyers for Jacques and Jessica Moretti for a response.On Wednesday, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention due to what prosecutors claim is a \"risk of flight\". She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day, authorities say.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued that he is a flight risk.Initial findings from the investigation into the blaze suggest that it was caused by sparklers igniting soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling.Authorities have acknowledged that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.The Swiss canton of Valais has now banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues.Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc ($12,500; £9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect donations.Additional reporting by Marianne Baisnée in Paris.",

    "description": "Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for ",
    "body": "Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for burial. Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money. At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country.  One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one. It was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said. Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it. The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body.  She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. \"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative. BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.The family member told the BBC in a message: \"We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.\"In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. \"Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of  ambulances,\" the source told the BBC. The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoJemma Crew,Business reporter andGraham Satchell,News correspondentOne of Britain's most prolific rail fare dodgers could face jail after admitting dozens of travel offences.Charles Brohiri, 29, travelled without buying a ticket on Govia Thameslink train journeys a total of 112 times, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.He could be ordered to pay more than £18,000 in unpaid fares and legal costs, the court was told.District Judge Nina Tempia warned Brohiri \"could face a custodial sentence because of the number of offences he has committed\". Brohiri, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, was dressed in black as he pleaded guilty to 76 offences on Thursday. Each offence was read out to him, with Brohiri quietly and repeatedly replying \"Guilty\" for around 20 minutes.It came after he was convicted in his absence of 36 charges at a previous hearing.During Thursday's hearing, Judge Tempia dismissed a bid by Brohiri's lawyers to have the 36 convictions overturned.They had argued the prosecutions were unlawful because they had not been brought by a qualified legal professional, but by a lay prosecutor.But Judge Tempia rejected the argument, saying there had been \"no abuse of this court's process\".In a written ruling setting out her decision, she said she agreed that \"a lay prosecutor can commence proceedings\".She added there has been an \" industry-wide use of non-authorised employees to lay informations which has been a long-standing process\".A Govia Thameslink Railway spokesperson welcomed the decision to uphold the previous 36 convictions.The 112 charges span from February 2024 to November 2025. They relate to journeys between London and  Brighton, and on the Thameslink lines into Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire.In addition, Brohiri is also accused of continuing to dodge fares in late November and December last year, and in January, prosecutor Lyndon Harris told the court.The most recent allegation was three days ago - on 12 January, he said.At a previous hearing in August last year, Brohiri was bailed and told \"not to be present on or attempt to gain access to any train owned or operated by Govia Thameslink\".He was bailed on the same conditions as imposed at previous hearings, to return for sentencing on 11 February.In addition, he is accused of failing to pay fines worth £48,682 from separate prosecutions between August 2019 and April 2025.",

    "body": "Venezuelan Nobel Peace Prize winner presents her medal to Trump2 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: Machado says she \"presented\" her Nobel Peace Prize medal to TrumpVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has told reporters that she presented the medal for her Nobel Peace Prize to President Donald Trump at a private White House meeting on Thursday, but did not say if he accepted it.\"I think today is a historic day for us Venezuelans,\" she said after meeting Trump, the first time the two have met in-person. In the weeks after US forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas, Trump has declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader.He is instead dealing with the acting head of state there, Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.ReutersAfter leaving the White House, Machado spoke to supporters gathered at the gates outside, telling them in Spanish, according to the Associated Press: \"We can count on President Trump.\"\"I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Machado later told journalists in English, calling it \"a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom\".It is not clear whether Trump accepted the award. Trump, who often speaks about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, had expressed displeasure when it was given to Machado and she decided to accept the honour last year. The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Machado said last week that she would share it with Trump, but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.\"Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others,\" the committee said in a statement last week. \"The decision is final and stands for all time.\"Asked for a reaction to Machado's remarks, the committee directed the BBC to their previous statement.Before the White House meeting on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Center posted on X that \"a medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot\". In her remarks, Machado described how the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought in America's Revolutionary War, gave a medal bearing the likeness of George Washington to Simon Bolivar, one of the founding fathers of modern Venezuela. The gift was \"a sign of the brotherhood\" between her country and the US \"in their fight for freedom against tyranny,\" Machado said.\"And 200 years in history, the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal - in this case a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize - as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom,\" she said.Machado also visited Congress to meet US senators during her visit to Washington, where her remarks to reporters were drowned out by supporters chanting \"María, presidente\" and waving Venezuelan flags.Machado had been expected to use her time with Trump to try to persuade him that backing Rodríguez's interim government was a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters as the meeting was underway on Thursday that Machado is \"a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela\" and that Trump \"was looking forward to this meeting and expecting a frank and positive discussion\" about the current realities of life in Venezuela.Trump has previously described Machado as a \"freedom fighter\", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic support.Since Maduro was seized on 3 January, the Trump administration has moved quickly to remake Venezuela's oil sector, which had been under US sanctions. On Wednesday an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m).Oil tankers suspected of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan oil have also been seized by the US, with US forces saying they had boarded a sixth tanker on Thursday.A Venezuelan government envoy is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps toward reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.Rodríguez delivered the annual Message to the Nation speech in Caracas on Thursday, in which she said she was willing to attend meetings in Washington as well.\"If I ever have to go to Washington as acting president, I will do so standing tall, walking, and not crawling,\" she said, calling on the country to \"not be afraid of diplomacy\" with the US. Trump and Rodríguez also spoke by phone on Wednesday, with Trump later describing his counterpart on social media as \"a terrific person\".  Rodríguez, meanwhile, described the call as \"productive and courteous\" and characterised by \"mutual respect.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoJoe PikePolitics correspondentEPAOn Wednesday afternoon in a large wood-panelled room in parliament, Robert Jenrick was sitting alongside Kemi Badenoch and the rest of the Conservative shadow cabinet talking about foreign policy.\"He was honestly very positive and chipper\", says one who was in the room.Within twenty-four hours a sensational leak from inside Jenrick's own Commons office would lead to him being thrown out of the party he joined as a teenager. And him deciding to back Reform, its biggest rival.For months Jenrick had been on defection watch, and behind the scenes Badenoch's team were picking up worrying signals.\"We'd been in a high state of alert\", says a senior conservative. \"For quite a long time we've been hearing from multiple people that he was on manoeuvres. We knew about at least one evening meeting he'd had with Farage in December\".Secret discussionsIn fact Jenrick had been having many more secret discussions with Reform figures for four months including with the party's leader.\"There were multiple conversations, many one-to-one meetings with Nigel,\" says a Farage ally.Was Jenrick offered a top cabinet job in a possible future Reform government? \"Nothing was offered\", insists the senior Reform source. \"Honestly, genuinely nothing.\"Jeff Overs/BBCThe leakBut as Badenoch wrapped up her shadow cabinet meeting at 17:00 GMT on Wednesday, she was taken aside and shown what her advisers immediately recognised was a bombshell leak.A source with access to Jenrick's office had handed the Tory leadership a draft of Jenrick's secret defection speech, which included excoriating attacks on shadow cabinet ministers.Jenrick's allies won't comment on the identity of the alleged leaker but do not dispute the document came from one of his inner circle.They deny, however, that the MP was ever careless with the draft: \"The speech never left Rob's office. The idea that it was left lying around somewhere is untrue.\"Badenoch immediately assembled her closest advisers including Conservative chief whip Rebecca Harris and a few other shadow cabinet ministers.\"My immediate reaction was it's treachery, it's disloyalty\" says one of those Badenoch consulted in her parliamentary office.\"The temptation in these situations is to do nothing and hope it goes away, or wait a day or two. But that would have been a cop out. And Kemi is not someone who cops out.\"The Conservative leader decided her only option was to move fast.The sackingOn Thursday, Badenoch woke before dawn and made the final decision to sack Jenrick. She sat down in front of her home computer to record a video announcing that he had been sacked from the shadow cabinet and suspended from the Conservative Party.She then rushed to catch a flight to Scotland.Jenrick's allies say he was in his office in Westminster later that morning when he received a call from Tory chief whip Rebecca Harris.She told him what the party had discovered. He protested his innocence and ended the call abruptly. Within minutes, Badenoch's team had posted her video.Soon after, Jenrick had a brief call with Nigel Farage. \"It was quick\", says one Reform source. They said: 'We're on: let's do it today'.\"Jenrick's allies argue his defection was the biggest moment of his career, and he feels \"liberated\" to have got it out the way.\"At very little notice and under immense pressure he delivered a speech and Q&A to the media incredibly well\", one says. \"There were no slip-ups.\"\"I think it nullifies a massive Tory attack - that Reform are one man band and not serious. Because Rob is very serious.\"Badenoch's supporters argue her improving performance in prime minister's questions and in the opinion polls in recent months meant Jenrick's chances of unseating her as Tory leader were vanishingly small.\"It's not because Kemi is failing that he's done this. It's because she's succeeding\", say one in the shadow cabinet.\"It's made it more difficult to get the top job. He has no chance of being leader before 2029. So why stay?\"Defection decisionThe fact Jenrick had drafted a full defection speech is surely proof his mind was made up before Badenoch made her surprise move.\"Rob had decided\", one close to him says. \"It was a question of when.\"They say he got increasingly frustrated after being told off by colleagues both for speaking out about grooming gangs, and for criticising the UK granting citizenship to British-Egyptian dissident Alaa Abd El Fattah - a decision made under the Conservatives.The final straw seems to have been a disagreement at a shadow cabinet away-day last Thursday over whether Britain was broken.\"He was very odd at the away day\", said one present. \"His body language was withdrawn, his chair was pushed back from the table, he was taking lots of notes.\"In Jenrick's telling the shadow cabinet were asked if they thought Britain was broken. He said yes. Some agreed but argued: \"We can't say that. Because it implies we broke it.\"If that away day was a turning point in the political career of Robert Jenrick and the right of British politics, it seems fitting that the meeting took place at a venue overlooking the Tower of London.\"It's a traditional home of traitors\", jokes one who was there. \"Which we didn't realise at the time.\"",

    "body": "45 minutes agoNardine Saad and Christal HayesLos AngelesActor Timothy Busfield has made his first court appearance after turning himself in on criminal charges that he allegedly sexually abused two boys on the set of a TV series filming New Mexico, prosecutors say.The Emmy-winning actor, who starred in Thirtysomething and The West Wing, was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse that police allege happened on the set of Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady.Busfield, 68, strenuously denied the allegations through his lawyer.\"The claims being made against Tim are completely false, and we will fight this to the end until the truth prevails,\" the lawyer, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said.Stein said the actor, who is also known for his roles in the baseball film Field of Dreams and the comedy thriller Revenge of the Nerds, was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother. During a media conference on Thursday, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said that Busfield made an initial court appearance on Wednesday and a judge ordered that he remain in custody. The case is now being transferred to district court and a hearing has been set for 20 January to determine whether Busfield should be released on bail pending trial.\"Our priority is to protect the rights of everyone involved,\" Bregman said at the news conference, urging anyone with information to contact law enforcement.In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors say the parents of boys allege that Busfield groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady, which Busfield both directs and executive produces. It airs on Fox in the US. In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. \"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. \"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. \"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

    "body": "Work to fix hospitals built using unsafe concrete will not be completed in time to meet the government's target, a new report has warned.Seven hospitals built using Raac, or reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, were prioritised for remedial work last year, with the government setting a deadline of 2030.The new buildings are now expected to open in 2032 and 2033 - but some are already facing pressure to meet the revised timetable, the National Audit Office (NAO) said.In a number of hospitals, roofs are being supported by metal props and some areas have been closed as unsafe.Meanwhile, affected health trusts face huge maintenance bills to keep their aging buildings safe.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the original New Hospitals Programme - 40 new hospitals by 2030 - promises \"that were never going to be met\".  In January 2025 he revised the scheme, prioritising 20 of the projects, including Raac hospitals, with more funding and later dates of completion.The NAO report says the 2025 review did put the programme on a \"more realistic, stable, long-term footing\". Standardising the design for some of the new buildings should speed up delivery and reduce costs, for example. But some of the new dates for completion have slipped. Torbay, Kettering and Musgrove Park hospitals are all delayed – they are estimated to be open nine to ten years later than under the previous plan.Raac is less durable than reinforced concrete as the \"bubbly\" structure can let water in, weakening the building material which can crumble and collapse. All of the seven \"prioritised\" schemes to replace Raac now won't be completed until 2032-33 and with \"significant operational and clinical risk and cost \", says the NAO.In the meantime, hospitals including the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds and The Queen Elizabeth Hospitals in Kings Lynn are facing huge maintenance bills to keep their sites open. By 2025 the seven hospitals will have required more than £500 million of investment to prevent structural failure.The NHS aims to remove all Raac concrete from its estate by 2035. The Department for Health and Social Care says so far there are 20 sites where it has been eradicated and that it is investing £1.6 billion across the next four years. Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown says the delays in addressing crumbling Raac must now be addressed \"as a matter of urgency.\"But the report warns that there is a tight construction schedule overall with little contingency in the next five years, so delivery dates could slip further.Mr Tim Mitchell, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \"A steadier plan is better than drifting, but patients cannot wait a decade for capacity that we need now. \"NHS trusts will be pouring scarce funds into patching up old buildings for longer, when that money should be used to create extra operating theatres, securing ring‑fenced beds and making sure that there is enough staff to run them.\"A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We've confirmed a sustainable funding plan and an achievable timetable to deliver all schemes in the programme. We are now getting on with building these much-needed facilities as quickly as possible.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoColletta SmithYour Voice CorrespondentA new funding scheme will give access to emergency cash for people on low incomes across England. The Crisis and Resilience Fund beginning at the start of April will provide £1bn annually for the next three years. People will be able to apply for emergency funds through their local council, whether or not they currently receive benefits. The new rules say councils can give money to people in financial shock where there is \"a sudden, unexpected expense or drop in income\", like a broken boiler, the loss of a job or to prevent people from entering crisis. It is a replacement for the temporary Household Support Fund which had been extended on a rolling basis since it was set up in 2021, but was due to finish at the end of March.The level of funding is broadly the same as the previous scheme, leaving some councils disappointed that there has not been more money allocated. A recent survey for the Local Government Association showed most councils in England did not believe the current funding will be sufficient to meet local welfare needs.The cash element is a significant change to the past scheme, which the government hopes will help fulfil a manifesto pledge to end \"mass reliance on emergency food parcels\".It means councils can give those experiencing difficulties direct access to cash in the hopes of removing the need for hand-out provisions.The guarantee of at least three years of funding mean councils can plan their support schemes and provision over a longer period.Emma Revie, co-chief executive at the Trussell Trust, a charity that supports food banks, said: \"The new Crisis and Resilience Fund is a vital step towards ensuring no-one is forced to turn to a food bank to get by.\"In guidance to councils, the Department for Work and Pensions said the money can be used for three different purposes: crisis payments, housing payments – for those facing an unexpected shortfall, and resilience services for funding the charities and local organisations currently providing front-line support.The payments could help in scenarios such as redundancy, help leaving an abusing relationship or an unexpected bill.  There is no stipulation about how each local authority should divide their funding between those different purposes.Barnardo's, the charity, said shifting the way support is given from vouchers, food bank referrals and emergency food parcels to cash payments will aid millions who are currently dependent on government and council-funded help. Some councils have already been using a cash-first approach and deliver them through Post Office cash vouchers or Pay-By-Text platforms that allow people to withdraw money at cash machines.The charity said those struggling should have more agency to choose how and where they want to spend that cash.\"This guidance sets out how crisis support can be delivered in a way that protects dignity, offers real choice and reaches those who need it most, said Barnardo's chief executive Lynn Perry.\"It has the potential to make a meaningful difference to children growing up in poverty.\"A proportionate level of funding will be given to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but it is up to those authorities to decide how the extra money is used. In England, local authorities will have to publish how they are going to use the money, and open up applications to the public by the 1 April. Minister for Employment Dame Diana Johnson, said: \"Thanks to this £1bn fund local authorities will have the certainty to provide emergency support and stop families falling into crisis in the first place.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoKerena CobbinaAFP via Getty ImagesOscar-winner Matthew McConaughey has trademarked his image and voice to protect them from unauthorised use by artificial intelligence (AI) platforms.Clips including his famous catchphrase \"alright, alright, alright\" from the 1993 film, Dazed and Confused, have been registered to the United States Patent and Trademark Office database, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports.It is the first time an actor has attempted to use trademark law to protect their likeness from AI misuse, his lawyers and an expert said.Stars across Hollywood and the music industry including Scarlett Johansson and Taylor Swift have endured a wave of fake video, audio and images online, created by AI tools.Lawyers for the Magic Mike star told the WSJ they had no current examples of McConaughey's likeness being manipulated by AI, but hoped the trademarks could be used broadly against any unauthorised copies of him.A secondary aim would be to \"capture some of the value that is being created with this new technology\", Kevin Yorn - one of the lawyers representing McConaughey - told the AFP news agency.\"My team and I want to know that when my voice or likeness is ever used, it's because I approved and signed off on it\", McConaughey said via email to the newspaper.\"We want to create a clear perimeter around ownership with consent and attribution the norm in an AI world\".Several clips were registered by the commercial arm of the Just Keep Livin Foundation, a non-profit organisation created by the Dallas Buyers Club actor and his wife Camila, according to AFP.Alina Trapova, an assistant professor in copyright law at University College London, also believes it to be first time an actor has attempted to use trademark law to their benefit against AI.Trapova has worked on copyright and AI for more than eight years. She told the BBC that AI is a big problem for celebrities, saying that they may object to unauthorised AI \"due to reputational reasons\", but for Hollywood stars it \"is often a case of missed licensing opportunities\".She said celebrities are experimenting with different forms of protection as \"unauthorised commercialisation\" of their likeness in the forms of deepfakes becomes \"more and more challenging in the age of AI\".McConaughey is not a hardline opponent of generative AI. He has a stake in ElevenLabs, a software company specialising in AI voice modelling \"for several years now\", according to the 56-year-old. The company has created an AI audio version of the 'Interstellar' actor, with his permission.Dr Sandra Wachter, professor of technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, says she would not be surprised if others in the creative industries did the same as McConaughey in the future.\"It is simple for companies to take your work and train a model to do your job. It is comparatively difficult for you to protect your work in the first place,\" she told the BBC. AI images and deepfakes are of growing concern in the entertainment world.In 2024, Scarlett Johansson said she was left \"shocked\" and \"angered\" after OpenAI launched a chatbot with an \"eerily similar\" voice to her own.OpenAI removed the voice, but insisted that it was not meant to be an \"imitation\" of the Avengers star.In June 2025, Disney and Universal sued AI firm Midjourney over its image generator, which the Hollywood giants alleged was a \"bottomless pit of plagiarism\".Also last year, an AI video generator on Elon Musk's X social media platform was accused of making \"a deliberate choice\" to create sexually explicit clips of Taylor Swift without prompting.Grok Imagine's \"spicy\" mode \"didn't hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos\" of the pop star without being asked, the Verge reported.",

    "body": "The landscape beneath Antarctica's icy surface revealed in unprecedented detail1 hour agoMark Poynting,Climate researcherandErwan Rivault,Senior data designerGetty ImagesA new map has unmasked the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice in unprecedented detail, something scientists say could greatly enhance our understanding of the frozen white continent.Researchers used satellite data and the physics of how Antarctica's glaciers move to work out what the continent might look like beneath the ice.They found evidence of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, and say their maps of some of Antarctica's hidden mountain ranges are clearer than ever before.While the maps are subject to uncertainties, the researchers believe the new details could shed light on how Antarctica will respond to climate change - and what that means for sea-level rise.\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News.Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery.In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet.But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made.\"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks.But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps.“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham.So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks.“It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. “And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden.\"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\"One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward.\"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping.\"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added.A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say.That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in a warming climate.And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science.“[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. The study is published in the academic journal, Science.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBenedict Garman,Emma PengellyandMatt Murphy,BBC Verify    BBCIsrael has moved the blocks which are supposed to mark its post-ceasefire line of control deeper into Gaza in several places, sowing confusion among Palestinians.Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that in at least three areas Israel placed blocks, before returning later and moving the positions further into the Strip.Under the terms of the US-brokered deal with Hamas, Israel agreed to withdraw troops beyond a line marked in yellow on Israeli military maps, which it has illustrated on the ground with concrete yellow blocks.Defence Minister Israel Katz warned in October that anyone crossing the Yellow Line would be \"met with fire\".Since these comments were made, there have been a series of deadly incidents around the line.In Beit Lahia, Jabalia and al-Tuffah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) placed blocks and later returned to move them deeper inside Gaza. In total, 16 positions were moved.In the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, satellite images show that IDF troops moved at least seven already placed blocks between 27 November and 25 December. The position of the markers were moved on average 295m (968ft) deeper inside the Strip.As well as the blocks that have been moved, BBC Verify mapped 205 other markers.  More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps.An IDF spokesperson said it rejected \"all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops\".\"The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment,\" they added.Analysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel's military described as a \"new border line\" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began.The latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a \"dangerous combat zone\" is.Last month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him \"trapped\".\"We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be,\" he said. \"The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.\"Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a \"tool for territorial engineering\".\"By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,\" he said.But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they \"find it easier to place\".Series of deadly incidents around the Yellow LineSince Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed.On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there. Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said.An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at \"suspicious individuals\" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals\".In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December.\"The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,\" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident.And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair had been gathering firewood for their disabled father when they were killed.Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects.An IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times \"beyond the Yellow Line\" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify.Demolitions and fortificationWhile Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October's ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line.In verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia.In some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF.In the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destructionIn the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line.In some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground.An IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels' destruction \"may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line\". On Wednesday, the US said the second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip. But there was no mention of a timeline for the withdrawal, which is linked to the \"demilitarisation\" of Hamas under October's ceasefire deal.In parts of the Strip, the markers have been placed shortly before work began on the construction of temporary Israeli fortifications such as roadblocks and defensive barriers beyond the mapped Yellow Line.Krieg told BBC Verify that the movement of the blocks would eventually allow Israel to turn parts of Gaza into a \"sterilised belt\".\"In practice, that means the status of land is less about what the ceasefire map says and more about where concrete blocks sit on a given day,\" he said.Additional reporting by Maha El Gaml.

    "body": "4 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterWatch: The \"two main parties are rotten\", Robert Jenrick says in first speech as a Reform memberFormer Conservative shadow minister Robert Jenrick has announced he is joining Reform UK, hours after he was sacked by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch for plotting to defect to Nigel Farage's party.Jenrick was unveiled at a press conference by Farage, who thanked Badenoch for expelling her former Tory leadership rival and helping \"realign the centre-right of British politics\".In a tirade against his old party and former colleagues, Jenrick said the Conservatives \"broke\" the country, were \"rotten\" and had \"betrayed its voters\".Speaking minutes before he took to the stage, Badenoch said it was a \"good day\" for the Conservatives and Jenrick was \"now Nigel Farage's problem\".Jenrick becomes the second sitting Tory MP  - after Danny Kruger in September 2025 - to switch to Farage's party, which has been consistently leading in national opinion polls for months.It also follows the defection of former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi this week, and about 20 former Tory MPs to Farage's party, which now has six sitting MPs in the House of Commons.Jenrick's switch to Reform UK was the culmination of a dramatic day that started with Badenoch posting a video to announce he had been dismissed from her shadow cabinet and suspended as a Conservative Party member.In the video, she said: \"I was presented with clear, irrefutable evidence that he was plotting in secret to defect in a way designed to be as damaging as possible to his shadow cabinet colleagues and the wider Conservative Party.\"Hours passed without a response from Jenrick, as Conservative sources told the BBC his plans had been rumbled after materials, including a defection speech, had been found \"lying around\".When Farage appeared at a press conference in Westminster on Thursday afternoon, he said he \"had to think very quickly as to how I should respond to this\".Farage said that, while he had been talking to Jenrick for months, he had not intended to present him as the party's latest Tory defector at the press conference.But he thanked Badenoch for what he called \"the latest Christmas present I've ever had\" before Jenrick walked on stage, following an awkward delay, to join the Reform UK leader.Watch: Jenrick's delayed entrance before he joins Farage at Reform UK's press conference\"It's time for the truth,\" Jenrick said in his speech. \"Britain has been in decline. Britain is in decline.\"He added: \"Both Labour and the Conservatives broke Britain. And both are now dominated by those without the competence or backbone needed to fix it.\"He said the Conservatives were in denial about the state of Britain and called out some of his former shadow cabinet colleagues by name in a string of personal criticisms. He said shadow chancellor Mel Stride had \"oversaw the explosion of the welfare bill\" and \"blocked the reforms needed\" when he was the work and pensions secretary.Dame Priti Patel, Jenrick said, had allowed a \"million migrants to come here\" in what he called \"the greatest failure of any British government in the post-war period\".Jenrick - a former housing secretary and immigration minister - served alongside both Stride and Patel in the Conservative governments led by Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.While Jenrick accepted he had roles in governments that had \"failed so badly\", he said he had been \"let down\" by Johnson and Sunak.Questioned by journalists, Jenrick said he had already \"resolved to leave\" the Conservatives before his sacking, saying it was something he had \"given a great deal of thought to over a very long time\".He said he would not resign to force a by-election in his Newark constituency and stand as a Reform UK candidate.He also had no ambitions to lead Reform UK, he said, telling reporters \"I want Nigel to be prime minister\".Farage said Jenrick \"will be joining our frontline team\", without specifying his role.The Reform UK leader said the local and national elections on 7 May represented a \"deadline\" after which no further Tory defections to Reform would be accepted .It appears Jenrick was bounced into the move to Reform UK by Badenoch.Minutes before Jenrick was unveiled as Reform UK's latest recruit, the Tory leader told the BBC:  \"I think the fact that Robert Jenrick was very happy to tell me just a few days ago he had no plans to defect while clearly plotting to do so and hurt his colleagues is not suitable for the Tory party.\"She added: \"It is not a blow to lose someone who lies to his colleagues.\"I think people can see that the only person that is telling the truth is me. I have a duty to protect my colleagues... and I have a duty to those who vote Conservative.\"This has been a good day, bad people are leaving my party.\"Watch: ‘Jenrick is no longer my problem' - BadenochBadenoch has appointed West Suffolk MP Nick Timothy, a former aide to Theresa May, as his replacement, praising him as \"a true Conservative\" and \"formidable campaigner\".Various Conservative sources have been speaking to the BBC with versions of what happened, with one shadow cabinet minister claiming Jenrick left a printed copy of his resignation speech lying around, \"like something from The Thick Of It\". This was backed up by a senior Conservative MP close to Badenoch, who said they had got hold of a \"full speech and media plan\" for his defection, and another Conservative source talking about \"material\" that was left \"lying around\".This source told the BBC there was \"plenty of evidence\" Jenrick was getting closer to Reform and the defection was being planned \"quite soon\" and \"in the most damaging way possible for the party\".It is alleged Jenrick had dinner with Farage last month - and his team had been speaking to \"various people\" about the possibility.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Badenoch's decision showed \"weakness\" and questioned why it had taken her so long to act.\"Jenrick has been making toxic comments to try and divide our country for months and months and months and it's only now, when he's on the verge of defecting to Reform, that Badenoch gets round to sacking him,\" he said.Sir Keir said the \"flood\" of Conservative politicians going across to Reform UK showed the \"Tory party is a sinking ship\" and added: \"Nigel Farage is welcoming these failed politicians into his ranks and building his party as a party of the Tory politicians who let the country down so badly.\"Jenrick's sacking and switching of allegiances is a pivotal moment for the future of the British right wing, with Conservative MPs genuinely fearful their party is being usurped by Reform UK.He finished second in the leadership election in 2024 and his creative use of social videos has only given him greater prominence since.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper MP said Jenrick \"has an industrial-grade brass neck to be complaining about how broken Britain is, when it was him and his Conservative cronies who did such damage to our country and to trust and faith in politics\".She added: \"Reform and the Conservatives are two sides of the same coin.\"",

    "body": "I didn't give up, I let go. How I came to terms with not having children5 minutes agoLucy HookerCaroline StaffordTry hard enough, we are often told, and eventually you'll get what you want.But sometimes the hardest - and bravest - thing to do, is to stop trying.After years of hoping to start a family, including the painful rollercoaster of fertility treatment and a devastating miscarriage on Christmas day, Caroline Stafford, found the only way to find some kind of peace again was to accept it was not going to happen and to build a different future. But that meant overcoming what she calls the \"don't give up\" narrative. Like many people, Caroline and her husband Gareth, who she met at school, took it almost for granted they would have children in due course. \"We spend all our lives trying not to get pregnant. I just assumed as soon as I wasn't trying not to, I would,\" she says.Caroline StaffordCaroline and Gareth met at school in NottinghamshireNearly one in five women in the UK do not have children.That can be for a variety of reasons, including personal choice. But some simply find that the family life they had imagined, does not happen.After a year of failing to conceive Caroline and Gareth went to see the GP. A round of IVF in the UK was followed by more rounds abroad - a process of anxious appointments, medications and injections.At the same time she watched as her friends fell pregnant and had babies of their own.\"We were absolutely delighted for them, but the truth was, it was the worst thing to hear,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett.For anyone in Caroline's situation, simply seeing a parent with a pram can be painful, the source of a gnawing envy.That feeling ate away at her, changing who she was.\"Your world view becomes smaller and often more negative.\"I started to not really like how I was feeling towards other people,\" she says.Friends would tell her not to worry, it would happen in the end, or that she should stop trying, because then she would fall pregnant.Then in November six years ago, out of the blue, her friends were proved right.  Not trying seemed to have worked.She and Gareth had been living in a big farmhouse, in Rutland. They had just moved to a small cottage in a village, a kind of acceptance on some level that the large family they had been dreaming of was not going to be.As the festive season approached they began to share the good news with friends and family.Then on Christmas morning Gareth went out to deal with the dairy herd. By the time he was back she had lost the baby.\"It was the timing, the way it happened. It just felt so cruel.\"Her memories of that day are hazy.But both of them feel that it was the turning point.Caroline StaffordTaking up long-distance running allowed Caroline to change her relationship with her body\"It felt like we both knew it was time to begin to try to let go,\" she says, but that in itself required a huge effort.\"I didn't know at the point whether I was right. But we just began to tread forward,\" she says.She threw herself into work. She had started her business, selling biscuits stamped with personalised messages, during their second round of IVF.At first if people said her business was her baby, she would bristle. These days she finds it comforting. After all, it is something she has nurtured for a decade.She now has a team of 14 in the bakery, sends her biscuits all over the country, and has partnered with a mail order flower firm.For Gareth letting go has meant rethinking his work altogether. He is about to start a new job as a greenkeeper at his golf club.People do ask her if she considered adopting, but she says it \"wasn't the path that we chose.\"\"Adoption isn't just another way to become a parent. It's a major decision.A decade of IVF had changed Caroline's relationship with her own body.\"I was focusing on this one thing it couldn't do,\" she says.She started long distance running and instead of berating her body over its failure, she started celebrating what it could do instead. She has now done four half and full marathons, while Gareth is on his sixth.\"I love the life I've got. \"I don't feel that direct sense of loss any more. It's a different, a softer kind of sadness now.\"She has found a greater sense of peace as time passes. Even that comes though with pangs of guilt, wondering whether coming to terms with her childlessness, means she did not want it enough, or try hard enough.She knows that's still the \"don't give up\" message, nagging at her conscience. \"We're taught growing up that effort equals results, but it's often not how it works.\"Life can still have meaning and it can still have purpose, even when it looks so drastically different from what you expected.\"If you, or someone you know, have been affected by pregnancy issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help.All episodes of Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett are available on BBC Sounds.

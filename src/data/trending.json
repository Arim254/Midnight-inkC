    "body": "Lord Mandelson released on bail after arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office3 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: Peter Mandelson arriving at home after being released on bailLord Mandelson has been released on bail, the Metropolitan Police says, hours after his arrest on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The Metropolitan Police said a 72-year-old-man was released pending further investigation. The BBC saw Lord Mandelson returning to his London home at 02:00 GMT. Lord Mandelson was arrested at an address in Camden, north London, on Monday and taken to a police station for interview. The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a government minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.The arrest on Monday followed search warrants at two addresses in Wiltshire and Camden, the police statement added.Lord Mandelson has not publicly commented in recent weeks on the Epstein files, but the BBC understands his position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The government has said it expects to release the first documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment in \"early March\".On Monday afternoon, he was seen being led away from his London home by plain clothes officers who put him in the back of an unmarked car.The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division. Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an \"asset sales plan\". He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010.Responding to Lord Mandelson's arrest, the family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor of sexual abuse, said they \"commend the British authorities for taking meaningful action and treating the Epstein files with the urgency they demand\". Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.In a statement, Sky and Amanda Roberts said: \"The contrast with the continued inaction in the United States is undeniable. Survivors deserve transparency, swift investigation, and real justice, no matter who is implicated.\"BBC News understands the government will continue talking to police about which documents can be released, after it was previously suggested an arrest could have implications for that process.The government still wants to be able to publish documents, which it hopes will back up Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Lord Mandelson had \"lied\" during his vetting process.Darren Jones, chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that records detailing follow-up questions posed by No 10 during the initial due diligence process for the appointment would not feature in the first tranche of published material, due to the \"interest in this document\" from the Met Police. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Lord Mandelson's arrest was \"the defining moment of Sir Keir's premiership\".Badenoch, who said the prime minister was \"weak\", added: \"Watching the man who he appointed to the highest position in our diplomatic service getting arrested by police is an image which I think is going to stay with us for many, many years to come.\"Pool/BBC NewsLord Peter Mandelson being escorted by a police officer outside his homeLord Mandelson has been urged by US politicians to answer questions as part of a Congress investigation into Epstein.He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.",

    "body": "5 hours agoThe arrest of Lord Mandelson on suspicion of misconduct in public office dominates Tuesday's papers. The Daily Telegraph leads a photo of the former ambassador to the US being led away from his London home by police officers. The paper calls his arrest \"a fresh blow\" to Sir Keir Starmer and comes after police launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while serving as business secretary, he passed sensitive government information to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson has not publicly commented in recent weeks on the Epstein files, but it is understood that his position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Guardian follows with the same photo as it reports that Mandelson's arrest comes days before a crucial byelection in Gorton and Denton in Manchester. The paper says it will be \"an uncomfortable reminder\" of what critics have said is one of the prime minister's \"worst lapses of judgment\" - the decision to appoint Mandelson as ambassador to Washington.\"Mandelson arrested over 'secrets passed to Epstein'\" is the Times' headline. The paper adds detectives are expected to interview Mandelson late on Monday night after he was taken to a London police station.Lord Mandelson's arrest \"sparks jeopardy for Number 10\" is the i Paper's take. It says the latest development \"threatens to reignite furore\" over the PM's appointment of Mandelson as US ambassador despite his known links to Jeffrey Epstein.\"Things can only get sweatier\" predicts the Sun as it features Mandelson being led away alongside a picture of the paper's front page from last week of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.\"Disgraced Lord held\" echoes the Daily Mirror.The Daily Mail describes an \"ashen-faced\" Mandelson as he was taken away by detectives on Monday afternoon. \"Now Mandelson faces the music\" is the headline.Alongside its lead of Mandelson's arrest, Financial Times features an interview with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the fourth anniversary of the war in Ukraine. Zelensky says Russia and Ukraine are at the \"beginning of the end\" of the conflict but urged the US to see through Vladimir Putin's negotiating \"games\", the paper reports.\"Four years of tears\" is how the Metro marks the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war.The Daily Express says Shamima Begum, who travelled to Syria to join Islamic State in 2015, may be planning a return to the UK despite being stripped of her British citizenship. Finally, the Daily Star introduces baby Hugo, the first baby in the UK born using the womb of a deceased donor. Hugo's parents also pay tribute to the donor, saying: \"Part of her will live on forever.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoKoh EweAnadolu Agency via Getty ImagesAt Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, visitors can touch and interact with tigersAuthorities in Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand, are investigating the deaths of dozens of tigers at a popular tourist attraction this month.Seventy-two tigers died in the span of less than two weeks across two facilities of Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, a park where visitors can touch and interact with tigers.The local livestock department said samples from the tigers showed canine distemper virus - though authorities have not confirmed how the outbreak happened.Officials said on Monday that they had cremated and buried the remains of the tigers.They were among more than 240 tigers living across the two facilities at Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, according to local media.\"By the time we realised they were sick, it was already too late,\" Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, director of the national livestock department, told local media - noting that it was harder to detect sickness in tigers compared to animals like cats or dogs.The provincial livestock office in Chiang Mai said last week that samples from the tigers' carcasses tested positive for canine distemper virus, as well as a bacteria associated with respiratory disease. Canine distemper virus is a highly contagious disease that attacks the host's respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. While it is typically found among dogs, it can also infect big cats - often fatally.The provincial livestock office had earlier said preliminary tests showed the tigers had been infected with feline parvovirus. Some local officials had also initially suspected the outbreak might have stemmed from contaminated raw chicken meat fed to the tigers, the Bangkok Post reported.Raw chicken was also suspected as the cause of a major bird flu outbreak at a tiger zoo in Chonburi province in 2004. In that case, nearly 150 tigers died or were euthanised to prevent further spread of the influenza.The disease control department said over the weekend that while none of the veterinarians or other staff working in the Chiang Mai tiger enclosures had fallen ill from canine distemper virus, they had been placed under observation for 21 days, Thai PBS reported.Animal rights groups say this case highlights the poor living conditions of captive tigers used for entertainment in Thailand. Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand said in a statement that the tigers' deaths exposed the \"extreme vulnerability of captive wildlife facilities to infectious disease\".\"Tragedies like this would be far less likely to happen\" if tourists \"stayed away\" from these attractions, Peta Asia told AFP.Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai has been temporarily closed for two weeks as officials carry out disinfection work.",

    "body": "Australian police find human remains in search for grandfather kidnapped by mistake4 hours agoLana LamSydneyNSW PolicePolice say Chris Baghsarian, 85, was kidnapped by mistake Australian police have found human remains in their search for a Sydney grandfather who they believe was kidnapped by mistake almost two weeks ago.Widower Chris Baghsarian, 85, was forcibly taken from his home in North Ryde just before dawn on 13 February, with CCTV showing a group of masked men bundling him into an SUV.Police say the incident was most likely a case of mistaken identity, and local media have reported the intended target was a relative of a man with links to a well-known organised crime family.On Tuesday, police confirmed they had found human remains near a golf course on the outskirts of Sydney, after an earlier search located a burnt out car.Police had found a blood-stained carpet in the boot of the car, which was linked to the alleged kidnappers and an abandoned property where it is believed Baghsarian was held hostage.In the days after the kidnapping, video circulating in Sydney's underworld purported to show the elderly man had been seriously injured.Police repeatedly appealed to the kidnappers for the man's safe return, saying he suffered from health issues and needed daily medication.\"They were intending to take somebody, but have taken the wrong person,\" Det Acting Supt Andrew Marks told reporters a few days after the kidnapping.\"The family are in distress. All they want is their father to be returned, their grandfather to be returned.\"New South Wales Premier Chris Minns had suggested the kidnappers could \"drop Mr Baghsarian off at a shopping centre or an emergency department or even a nursing home\".Cases of mistaken identity have become more common in Sydney's underworld, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, as large organised crime networks increasingly subcontract crimes.Last year, a 23-year-old plumber was shot dead in his driveway in Condell Park in what police believe was also a case of mistaken identity.\"The fact that these offenders – these kidnappers – have got it so wrong is concerning,\" Marks said.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesGPs in England are to be paid £3,000 a year bonuses to prescribe patients weight loss drugs.The government is adding the incentive payments to the GP contract starting in April.GPs will also get extra money – worth about £1,000 a year - for referring patients on to weight loss programmes.Ministers said it was important that patients who could benefit from weight loss support were able to access it.But obesity experts warned the scheme would have limited impact because the drugs were still being tightly-restricted on the NHS – and this move would do nothing to widen eligibility.The incentive payments will only apply to Mounjaro.The other new generation weight loss drug available on the NHS – Wegovy – is not prescribed by GPs but instead is given by specialist NHS weight loss services.More than 1 million people are estimated to be using weight loss drugs, given as injections, with nine in 10 paying for them privately.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Weight loss drugs can be a real game changer for those who need them. I'm determined that access should be based on need, not ability to pay.\"Outside the NHS, we've seen those who can spare the cash buying privately, and the proliferation of rogue prescribers peddling dangerous unlicensed drugs that are putting patients at risk.\"Investing in general practice will help bring this modern medicine to the many, not just the few, and help shift the focus of the NHS from treatment to prevention.\"Incentive payments are a normal part of the GP contract and in the past have been paid for a variety of other things to improve everything from dementia care to boosting vaccination rates and to prescribe statins to lower the risk of heart disease.This will be the first time weight loss drugs have been made part of the contract with the £3,000 available for prescribing the maximum number of eligible patients Mounjaro.The drug only started being prescribed by GPs during this financial year – and access has been restricted to those severely obese with both a BMI of over 40 and certain health conditions.Next year that will be widened to those with a BMI of over 35 with the expectation that by 2028, 220,000 patients will be on Mounjaro provided by the NHS. The eligibility thresholds are lower for certain ethnic groups.However, rollout so far has been reported to be patchy with not all GPs currently prescribing them as much as expected.Katharine Jenner, director of Obesity Health Alliance, said the incentives were a welcome step.But she added: \"This doesn't mean weight loss drugs will suddenly be available to everyone who wants them.\"NHS access will remain very limited and focused on those with the greatest clinical need, and these treatments are most effective when combined with sustained support.\"And she added: \"If we're serious about moving from sickness to prevention, expanded treatment must go alongside stronger action to improve the food environment and prevent obesity in the first place.\"Dr Katie Bramall, of the British Medical Association, said: \"While the headlines promise much, in reality there will be no change to NHS England's eligibility criteria for patients to access injectable weight‑loss medication on the NHS. \"These proposals will do nothing over the next year to address the divide between those able to pay and those left waiting unable to afford private self-funded treatments\"And Prof Victoria Tzortziou Brown, of the Royal College of GPs, added: \"GPs do not withhold treatment or prescribe based on financial incentives. Decisions are guided by clinical judgement and what is safest and most appropriate for individual patients.\"Widening the roll-out of these medications in general practice could end up increasing workload in a way that may not be sustainable and risk raising unrealistic expectations among patients who may not be eligible or for whom these medicines are not suitable.\"",

Afterwards, she spoke through an interpreter.Pelicot said she had received \"incredible strength\" from the public after coming forward with her story. \"You have so much support,\" the Queen said in response.The meeting came after Pelicot launched her book at a sold-out event at London's Royal Festival Hall on Friday. It featured readings from Hollywood actresses Kate Winslet, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliet Stevenson.Last year, Queen Camilla sent Pelicot a letter praising her \"extraordinary dignity and courage\". In the letter, the Queen said Pelicot had \"inspired women across the globe\" and \"created a powerful legacy that will change the narrative around shame, forever\".Pelicot said the letter, which left her \"overwhelmed\", was now framed in her office.PA MediaThe Queen joked about her French language skills with Pelicot and her partner, Jean-Loup Agopian.The harrowing details of Pelicot's ordeal shocked the world in 2024.A court heard how for many years she had been drugged unconscious by her then-husband Dominique and raped by dozens of men he had recruited online. After a 16-week public trial, 46 men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two of sexual assault. Dominique Pelicot was handed the maximum jail sentence of 20 years.Millions were moved by Gisèle Pelicot's presence at the trial, and she received an outpouring of support in France and beyond.She said it was time to make \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist - a message that resonated with many, including the groups of women that gathered in support outside court every day, carrying signs demanding justice.ReutersFor most of the meeting, the pair spoke through an interpreter.She also recalled the moment she decided to waive her legal right to anonymity - a decision she says she has never regretted.",

He could face life in prison without parole or the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors allege that Reiner fatally stabbed his father and mother, Michele, inside a bedroom of their home before fleeing. Reiner, who is being held in custody, will next appear in court on 29 April.Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, were found dead in their home by their daughter on 14 December.The couple died from \"multiple sharp force injuries\", according to the LA County medical examiner.

    "body": "Landmark royal commission into antisemitism prompted by Bondi shooting begins5 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesThe federal royal commission will look at antisemitism and its drivers in AustraliaAustralia's royal commission into antisemitism, prompted after the Bondi Beach shootings that killed 15 people and injured 40, has begun public hearings.The federal commission - the country's most powerful form of public inquiry - will investigate the prevalence and key drivers of antisemitism and make recommendations to government.Headed by former High Court Justice Virginia Bell, the inquiry - which started on Tuesday - will also examine the events leading up to the attack, which was Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had resisted calls for a federal inquiry, saying it would hinder social cohesion but later bowed to public pressure.\"I acknowledge the importance of addressing antisemitism within the Australian community,\" Bell said in a statement last week. \"I plan to conduct the inquiry as expeditiously as possible.\"The commissioner is expected to hand down an interim report by the end of April, and a full report no later than the first anniversary of the attack, which took place on 14 December last year.She will outline the parameters of the inquiry on Tuesday before a brief opening statement from the counsel assisting the inquiry.The probe is expected to later hear from security agencies and intelligence services, as well as families of victims and survivors of the attack.One of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene of the shootings. His son Naveed Akram - the other alleged attacker - was critically injured and later transferred from hospital to prison.The 24-year-old appeared in court last week for the first time, facing 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.In light of the ongoing criminal case, the royal commission has been instructed to avoid matters that might prejudice current and future court proceedings. This may mean some hearings are conducted behind closed doors. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Albanese announced a review by a former spy chief to look at what federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the lead-up to the attack and what improvements could be made.He said that review, alongside a royal commission called by the state of New South Wales, would be the best way to respond to the attacks and that a federal inquiry would give a platform to antisemitic hate speech.However Albanese was forced to reverse his decision amid continued calls by prominent Jewish leaders and a number of the families affected - which were echoed by the opposition leader at the time.As a result, the the review into federal law enforcement and agencies will be folded into the royal commission and the NSW inquiry was cancelled.The shootings also prompted a raft of new gun laws and crackdown on hate speech, as well as greater powers to limit protests.The commission comes amid an already fraught debate raging in Australia over Israel, Gaza and antisemitism.Earlier this month, a rally against a visit by Israeli president Isaac Herzog was marred by violent scuffles between police and protestors. Herzog had been invited by Albanese as a comfort to the families affected by the Bondi attack, but his visit was opposed by thousands of Australians over his government's actions in Gaza.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorReutersA Reform government would end more generous defined benefit pension schemes for new local government workers and merge nearly 100 separate schemes to create a £500bn British Sovereign Wealth Fund. The new fund would increase investments in UK companies, products, housing and infrastructure by £100bn according to Richard Tice, head of Reform's proposed new Department of Business Trade and Energy.In a speech on Tuesday, Tice will also vow to ditch the government's environmental targets and scrap new employment rights including protections around sick pay and unfair dismissal.The Labour Party said Reform had \"formally declared war on British workers\" with its plans to wind back workers' rights.Unlike state pensions - which are paid out of general taxation - local governments and their workers pay into schemes that guarantee a level of income in retirement, often linked to final or average salaries. There are nearly 100 of these \"defined benefit\" local government pension schemes across the UK with more than 7 million members or pensioners and over £400bn in assets. Reform plans to bar any new entrants to these schemes and - like most of the private sector - enrol new hires into defined contribution schemes. In those schemes payout is not guaranteed, but instead depends on contributions made by the employee and employer, and gains (or losses) from market investments. When this idea was first floated last November, the public sector union Prospect described it as \"a baseless attack on public servants\" which would \"only worsen the current recruitment and retention crisis in our public services, and would plunge the services people rely on into staffing chaos.\"Jon Richards, assistant general secretary of the public service union Unison, said those in charge of Reform were not on the side of working people.\"Forcing council staff on to inferior pensions would leave retired workers poorer and worsen an already severe recruitment crisis for local government,\" he said.Reform officials confirmed these changes were now party policy and will be set out by Tice in his Birmingham speech.Reform plans to force schemes to invest a much larger portion of the accumulated assets of the existing defined benefits schemes in British companies and products to boost economic growth. The allocation of UK pension savings invested in UK companies has fallen from about 40% two decades ago to below 4% as pension fund trustees have chosen to invest in safer assets like government bonds or shares with historically higher returns in other markets. Reform's plans to increase the new fund's investment in UK shares to 25% of the total - which the party claims would see an extra £100 billion investment in UK listed shares. The government has also set out intentions to merge dozens of local government schemes into a few large funds but has no current plans to end the guaranteed nature of the existing defined benefit plans. Government also hopes to encourage more pension investment in UK markets but proposals to mandate or force pension funds to invest more in domestic markets have drawn criticism from pension providers and the governor of the Bank of England. Andrew Bailey told reporters last summer: \"I do not support mandating, I don't think that's appropriate\". Returns on investments in UK shares have been well below the returns seen on investments in US shares over the last 20 years, but have performed better so far this year. In his speech, Tice will call the government's new employment rights rules \"daft regulations\" that would hinder economic growth. He will also criticise the government's environmental policies saying that a Reform government would maximise production of \"every last barrel\" of UK oil and gas.A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage and his cronies want to rip up hard-won workers' rights on parental leave, sick pay, and would cut up to a million clean energy jobs in the process.\"Pensions expert John Ralfe told the BBC that comparisons of this new fund with sovereign wealth funds in countries including Norway and the Gulf states were wide of the mark.\"Reform forgets that local government pension schemes have made promises to members to pay guaranteed inflation linked pensions over many years,\" he said.\"That's a crucial difference with other sovereign wealth funds which have no promises to pay. They are just a bunch of assets, usually from oil revenues, with no liabilities to meet.\"Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Reform's plans would not fix the economy.\"Rebranding a government pension scheme does not make a sovereign wealth fund. Reform talk of being the next Singapore but the substance simply isn't there,\" he said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAna FaguyWatch: US TV reporters battle snowy conditions as a major storm hits east coastA major storm hit the US east coast on Monday, bringing record-breaking snow that caused disruptions for millions and thousands of flight cancellations. Parts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts have seen nearly 37in (94cm) of snow fall, with more than 19in in New York City's Central Park, the National Weather Service said. There have been \"near impossible\" travel conditions in New York, a state agency warned. More than 600,000 homes and businesses on the east coast endured power outages, with New Jersey and Massachusetts the worst hit.Winter storm warnings stretched from North Carolina to northern Maine, with some warnings in place further north in parts of eastern Canada.The snow was expected to persist throughout Monday, according to the National Weather Service, with some areas near the northeast coastline expected to get a total of 1ft to 2ft (61cm) of snow by Tuesday morning.Rhode Island, America's smallest state, appeared to have received the most snow during the storm. In fact, it has become the worst snowstorm to ever hit the state, according to local media.Providence, the state capital, received 36in of snow, smashing the existing record for the single greatest snowstorm, 28.6in set in February 1978.\"It completely smashed it,\" Candice Hrencecin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston, told the New York Times. \"We were just as shocked as everyone else.\"A ban on non-essential travel was implemented in Rhode Island and also in neighbouring Connecticut. Later in the day, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey also imposed a travel ban.\"I'm issuing a travel ban on all non-essential driving in Southeastern Massachusetts — and reducing the speed limit on the Pike to 40mph [25kmh],\" she said in an online post, referring to a major highway in the state.\"Whiteout conditions are making travel extremely dangerous,\" she added. \"If you get stuck, help will have a hard time reaching you... I strongly urge everyone to stay off the roads no matter where you live.\"In Massachusetts, nearly 300,000 were without power, according to poweroutage.us, including 85% of customers in Barnstable County, which includes all of Cape Cod.Watch: Winter storm covers parts north-east US in snowIn New York City, a travel ban brought the city of over 8 million to a near standstill before it was lifted at noon local time. All roads, highways and bridges were shuttered.In Connecticut and New Jersey, there were concerns that falling trees and branches could lead to dangerous road conditions and more power outages.In Providence, a city spokesman told The Providence Journal that more than 300 vehicles had been towed for parking in the way of snowploughs. Though by the afternoon on Monday, tow operations had stopped and drivers were instead helping people whose vehicles had gotten stuck.Meanwhile, people looking to travel within the US on Monday, struggled. The number of cancelled flights within, into or out of the US reached more than 5,706, according to tracking website FlightAware.The site shows that 98% of flights out of New York's LaGuardia airport were cancelled, and 91% of flights from JFK - New York City's primary airport hubs that typically see more than 335,000 passengers daily. Both locations had seen around 19in (48cm) of snow.Boston's Logan International Airport cancelled 92% of outgoing flights on Monday, while New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport cancelled 92%, and Philadelphia International Airport cut 80%.The region will continue to reel from the snow on Tuesday, when more than 2,000 flights into or out of the US are expected to be cancelled, with Boston and New York airports the worst hit.

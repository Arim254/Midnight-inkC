    "body": "41 minutes agoKatie RazzallCulture and media editorShumeet Banerji is not a household name. In the three years, 10 months and 14 days that he spent on the BBC board, Banerji kept his thoughts on BBC matters firmly out of the public domain.Now he is making headlines. His resignation is the latest blow to the corporation, and it looks timed to add to the pressure.Banerji's role on the board was due to end on 31 December anyway but he has instead resigned early, three days before other board members are due to face a committee of MPs - and nearly two weeks after the BBC lost its director general and its CEO of news.The resignation, fairly or not, looks like a direct criticism of the BBC's chair Samir Shah.Banerji, according to an insider, was known to be angry that Shah was - in his view - weak in not challenging a number of other board members and their assertion about systemic bias at BBC News.In this characterisation, the four political appointees to the board - Shah is the fifth - have banded together around the view that the BBC too often suffers from liberal groupthink, and the chair has been unable, or unwilling, to steer his board to a place of real consensus.In the end, after all the drama of the past few weeks - the leaked memo, the resignations, the apology over the Panorama edit and the threat of a defamation suit by Donald Trump - it boils down to one simple question. Is BBC News institutionally biased?Deborah Turness and Tim Davie reject that. So does Shah. While acknowledging mistakes have been made, he told me \"the BBC News DNA and culture is to be impartial, to provide the best news we can and the most trustworthy news we can\".BBC News remains the most trusted source of news in the UK.But if some members of the board believe that the BBC does suffer from systemic bias, and others do not, where does this end?A senior TV executive told me Shah inherited \"a house divided but this board is melting down, it's very sad\". They added: \"It's a leadership issue.\"When I interviewed him after the resignations of Davie and Turness, Shah told me the board had \"a diversity of views, as there are in the public, as there are in the country itself… I want robust conversations, I want discussion\".But Banerji has now claimed he was not consulted over the events that led to those departures. If true, it will feed into the narrative advanced in some quarters that what has happened has been a coup by some members of the board. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called on the government to remove Sir Robbie Gibb, an ex-BBC executive and former Downing Street director of communications to Theresa May, from the board.Shah told me the notion of a coup was \"fanciful\". He added that \"it's unfair and it's disrespectful to the members of the board to say that because they feel strongly about something, that somehow it's to do with their history\".But Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC's Six o'clock and Ten o'clock News, who was later director of communications at Number 10 under David Cameron, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"the stakes were already high for Samir Shah and they just got even higher\".He added that \"all eyes are going to be on Samir Shah on Monday\". \"The questions I think he's going to really have to answer are, is it true that months ago you chaired a BBC meeting where the Panorama issue was on the table and you decided to take no action? And if so why - particularly after what you've now said - did you not take action then?\"And I think that the next question that he's really going to have face is, when Michael Prescott's report was leaked to the Telegraph, why did you preside over such a long time of the BBC not coming out, particularly when the executive wanted to get out and cauterize the issue as cleanly as possible?\"In the last few days, prior to Banerji's resignation, I spoke to insiders at the BBC as well as people outside, who told me that Shah will remain as chair, whatever his perceived shortcomings. As one person put it to me, \"you can't have the DG, the CEO of News and the chair all resign\".Does Banerji's resignation shift the dial on his ability to continue in the role? It certainly makes Shah's appearance along with fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson in front of the Culture Media and Sport Committee on Monday even more critical.MPs on that committee voiced their reservations about whether he was qualified for the job when he was appointed as chair last year. He will need to demonstrate to those MPs, the industry, BBC audiences and staff at the corporation who will be watching, that he has the capabilities and support needed to steer the BBC through these turbulent times.",

    "body": "47 minutes agoAlex Smith, Chris Ewokor,BBC Africa, in Abuja, and Elettra NeysmithBBCSt Mary's School, in Niger state, was attacked in the early hours of Friday morningMore than 300 children and staff are now thought to have been kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, making it one of the worst mass abductions the country has seen.The Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 students and 12 teachers were taken from on St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state - substantially more than previously estimated.It said the figures have been revised upwards \"after a verification exercise\".The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups. The revised number of people taken surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police said armed men stormed the school at around 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning, abducting students who were staying there.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"Police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".It was initially reported that 215 pupils had been taken - but that figure has since been revised upwards. The new number is believed to be almost half of the school's student population, the news agency AFP reports.Authorities in Niger state said the school had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.They said in a statement the move exposed pupils and staff to \"avoidable risk\". The school has not commented on that claim.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs - but this has had little effect.Friday's mass abduction was the third such attack in the country in a week.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state.A church was also attacked further south, in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 others abducted.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has postponed his foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.The central government has ordered more than 40 federal colleges to close and public schools in some states have been shut.But the rising insecurity is fuelling anger as well as fear in Nigeria, with citizens demanding stronger action to protect children and communities.The mass abduction follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria - an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok 2014.The incident courted international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed - but as many as 100 still remain missing.",

    "body": "10 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesEvery winter, the search for the secret to staying well seems to intensify. Supermarket shelves fill with \"immune-boosting\" shots, cold water swimming groups grow and social media becomes crowded with tips on how to fend off seasonal bugs. But with so many remedies promising to keep colds and flu at bay, how much of it actually works and is it even possible to boost your immune system in the first place?Cold water swimming: A buzz, not a boostGetty ImagesCold water swimming has surged in popularity, with some enthusiasts convinced it keeps winter illnesses at bay.Immunologist professor Eleanor Riley tells BBC Radio 4's Inside Health podcast that the post-swim \"high\" is real, but it's driven by adrenaline and endorphins.\"If you take a blood sample before and after a cold swim, white blood cell levels do rise,\" she explains. \"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream. \"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells.\" Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection. Feeling \"brighter, more alert and more connected\" has real physiological effects.Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.\"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses. GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming. Kombucha: Interesting but little evidenceGetty ImagesMany people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.But Dr McCartney remains cautious. \"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system. Supplements: Just expensive urineGetty ImagesVitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds. She says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you \"expensive urine\". However, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\". But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit. Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help. Vaccinations: The only boost that worksGetty ImagesThe likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.Professor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water. \"The solution can dilute the blocked nose, stimulate turnover of mucus and relieve inflammation.\" All three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress. Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly.",

    "body": "COP30 climate talks overrun with deadlock over fossil fuels45 minutes agoMark Poynting and Georgina Rannard,climate and science reporters, in Belém, BrazilEPAThe summit has had a large number of delegates from indigenous groups, but some say they still have not been listened toFights over fossil fuels and money appear to have deadlocked the COP30 climate talks, as negotiations ran through the night with no sign of an agreement.Talks were meant to wrap up by 18:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Friday - and with many delegates already leaving, time is running out to secure a deal.Host Brazil had hoped countries would agree to set out how to move away from fossil fuels - but a draft deal released on Friday morning failed to mention coal, oil and gas, whose emissions are the main cause of climate change.That was unacceptable to a group of countries including the UK, while some poorer nations want stronger commitments on cash to help them cope with rising temperatures.A meeting - or \"plenary\" - has been scheduled for 10:00 local time (13:00 GMT) to pass some of the less contentious issues.But there is still no sign of a resolution on the major talking points - principally the future of fossil fuels and the money that developing countries should receive from richer nations.All countries present at these annual climate talks have to agree in order to pass a deal.That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change.As a result, the conference usually overruns, sometimes by more than a day. But two-thirds of countries signed up to the UN climate convention must be present for decisions to be made, according to UN rules.And with many delegates due to leave over the coming hours, the clock is ticking for countries to come to an agreement.ShutterstockBrazilian President Lula called for countries to show greater ambition at the talksBrazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would move away from coal, oil and gas. \"The world needs a clear roadmap to end its dependence on fossil fuels,\" he said ahead of the talks.It would advance a deal made two years ago, at COP28 in the United Arab Emirates, where countries agreed on the need to \"transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems\".The idea of a \"roadmap\" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but strongly opposed by oil-producing nations. Some of these countries argue they should be allowed to exploit their fossil fuel reserves as others have done in the past.And they have often called for the focus to be on reducing emissions, rather than fossil fuels themselves, through technology like carbon capture.Many scientists have criticised that approach for failing to tackle the problem at source.Some developing countries have not backed the fossil fuel deal, because they want richer nations to first deliver money to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. Richer nations have historically underdelivered on those promises. Poorer countries have repeatedly called for greater support, arguing they are facing the worst impacts of climate change despite bearing relatively little responsibility for rising temperatures.The latest version of the agreement, released on Friday morning, had not a single mention of fossil fuels, which was viewed as unacceptable by many nations. On Friday, UK Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband said he was determined to keep the plan for a roadmap away from fossil fuels \"alive\" in \"one way or another\".Tom Ingham/BBCCountry representatives are inside a negotiating room with journalists and observers waiting for news outsideThe draft deal did include a call for efforts to triple finance available to countries by 2030, to help them adapt to climate change.But it did not say if this should come from governments of richer nations or from other sources, like the private sector.Despite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil has come under scrutiny for its own plans. Its offshore oil and gas production is on course to increase until the early 2030s, according to analysis shared with the BBC by campaign group Global Witness.The forecast is based on data from respected analysts Rystad Energy, which has confirmed the figures.But President Lula has repeatedly defended fossil fuel development, arguing oil revenues can help fund the move to cleaner energy in Brazil.He has also pointed to his record in slashing rates of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.Ahead of the talks, President Lula launched a fund to try to prevent the loss of tropical forests around the world.But getting nations to commit to the fund has proved challenging.",

    "body": "19 minutes agoJames Chater and Jaroslav LukivReutersThe leaders of the UK, France and Germany met Zelensky in Kyiv earlier this yearUkraine's allies will seek to \"strengthen\" a US plan to end the war with Russia when they meet at the G20 summit in South Africa, UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has said.The summit begins a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukraine faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over pressure to accept the plan - leaked details of which have been seen as favourable to Moscow.Zelensky held phone talks with Sir Keir and the leaders of France and Germany on Friday. Afterwards, the PM said Ukraine's \"friends and partners\" remained committed to securing a \"lasting peace once and for all\".Neither US President Donald Trump nor Russian President Vladimir Putin are attending the G20.The widely leaked US peace plan includes proposals that Kyiv had previously ruled out, including ceding eastern areas it currently controls.Washington has been pressing Kyiv to accept and sent senior Pentagon officials to  Ukraine earlier this week to discuss the proposals.But there is nervousness in Europe over what has been perceived as a set of terms heavily slanted in Moscow's favour. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called the prospect of it being adopted a \"very dangerous moment\".According to news agency Reuters, she told reporters: \"We all want this war to end, but how it ends matters. Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded, ultimately the terms of any agreement are for Ukraine to decide.\"Ahead of the talks at the G20, Sir Keir said gathered leaders would \"discuss the current proposal on the table, and in support of President Trump's push for peace, look at how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations\".He continued: \"Not a day has passed in this war where Ukraine hasn't called for Russia to end its illegal invasion, roll back its tanks and lay down its guns.\"Ukraine has been ready to negotiate for months, while Russia has stalled and continued its murderous rampage. \"That is why we must all work together, with both the US and Ukraine, to secure a just and lasting peace once and for all.\"As part of the White House's plan, Ukraine would be obliged to cut the size of its army and pledge not to join the Nato military alliance, a long-held Kremlin demand.Trump warned on Friday that Ukraine would lose more territory to Russia \"in a short amount of time\" and that Zelensky \"is going to have to approve\" the plan. The US president said he had given Ukraine until Thursday to agree to the plan - Thanksgiving in the US - which he described as an \"appropriate\" deadline.Russian troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line, despite reported heavy losses.Ukraine relies on deliveries of US-manufactured advanced weaponry to arms its forces, including air defence systems.Kyiv has also been dependent on intelligence provided by Washington since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.US Vice-President JD Vance said on Friday that it was a \"fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand\".During a meeting with his security cabinet on Friday, Putin confirmed the US had presented its proposed peace plan, and said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement - though added detailed talks on its terms had not yet been held in the Kremlin.He said Russia was willing to \"show flexibility\" but was also prepared to fight on.In a 10-minute address in front of the presidential office in Kyiv, Zelensky warned that Ukraine would face \"a lot of pressure... to weaken us, to divide us\".\"We're not making loud statements,\" he went on, \"we'll be calmly working with America and all the partners... offering alternatives\" to the proposed peace plan.In perhaps the strongest language since the plan was proposed, the Ukraine president's office said on Saturday that Kyiv \"will never be an obstacle for peace\" but that representatives would \"defend legitimate interests of the Ukrainian people and the foundations of European security\".EPAA Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Ternopil this week killed at least 31 peopleZelensky has had to strike a careful balance between Kyiv's interests and maintaining cordial ties with Trump, with whom he had a public falling-out at the White House earlier this year and who has appeared at times frustrated at the lack of progress in peace talks.His reaction to the US plan has been measuredly worded - though he did admit on Friday that Ukraine \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\".The White House has pushed back on claims that Ukraine was frozen out of the drafting of the proposal.An unnamed US official told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the plan was drawn up \"immediately\" following discussions with Ukraine's top security official Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of it.The leaked draft proposes Ukrainian troops' withdrawal from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, giving Russia de facto control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Russia currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, though no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentAlex Lake / @twoshortdays\"We are Radiohead. Pleased to meet you,\" said Thom Yorke in one of his few addresses to the audience\"Whenever you're ready,\" says Thom Yorke, adopting the tone of a schoolteacher waiting for an unruly class to settle down, as Radiohead get ready to play their encore at London's O2 Arena.It's a rare flash of humour from the frontman, whose onstage utterings are mostly limited to mumbled \"thank yous\". But it's also an acknowledgment of how long fans have been waiting for this show.It is now 10 years since Radiohead last released new material, and 99 months since their last UK gig.Anticipation for their return has been building ever since they announced a limited run of concerts in September. Setlists from early shows in Spain and Italy have generated news stories (\"Radiohead play Nice Dream for the first time since 2009\"), as fans pore over the song choices. According to one source, they've rehearsed 65 different numbers.At the O2, the band sift through their entire discography - from the arena rock anthems of 1994's The Bends to the celestial ballads of A Moon Shaped Pool, via the layered electronics of Kid A, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary.There are some signs that Radiohead are a bit rusty. A few timing and tuning issues crop up, which could easily be the result of a first night in a new venue, but which feel odd for a band of such technical proficiency.But when it comes together, it's a rapturous, spell-binding sight.Band members switched instruments several times within songsThey begin with the spacey, hypnotic Planet Telex, and follow it up with a crunchy version of  2+2=5, written in 2003 as a reaction to George W Bush's \"War on Terror\", and taking on new urgency in a world where political norms have seemingly been turned upside down.By the third song, Sit Down, Stand Up, they're flexing their musical muscles, with an extended outro of percussive lunacy, aided by US session musician Chris Vatalaro.His addition to the line-up is a giveaway. Radiohead's secret sauce has always been their rhythm section - who manage to locate sinewy, danceable grooves even when presented with their bandmate's most challenging material.The prowling bassline of National Anthem and the slamming drum loops of Idioteque, in particular, give the audience ample opportunity to jump up and down.That said, it's amusing to watch bassist Colin Greenwood try (and fail) to get the crowd clapping in time to the glitchy and unconventional rhythms of 15 Step. Instead, most of them simply bob their heads up and down in unified appreciation of the music. At times, it looks like a convention of nodding dogs.Cushioned between the more experimental songs, however, were the real crowd-pleasers: An elegiac version of Lucky, a beautifully twisted No Surprises and a genuinely sublime version of Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.I have a theory, however, that the band's notorious dislike of \"the old stuff\" is an elaborate ruse. They've never really stopped playing songs from The Bends and OK Computer - but the suggestion they won't makes it all the more exciting when they break into something anthemic like Fake Plastic Trees.That song opened Friday night's encore, which dwelt largely on their 90s material, including Let Down - a deep cut that's had a new lease of life on TikTok - and the epic Paranoid Android.Alex Lake / @twoshortdaysThe tour continues until 12 DecemberIntroducing a muscular version of Just, Yorke explains that it was written \"on a freezing cold farm in 1994\", in a period where they thought they'd only be remembered for one song: Their 1992 breakout Creep.We all know the story ended differently, but the reunion does find Radiohead in a strange position. This tour comes with no new material, and the last seven years have been so fertile with side projects, most notably Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood's three albums as The Smile, that it seemed Radiohead's members might have permanently moved on.Several factors got in the way - grief, parenthood, mental health and rumours of intra-band tension over Israel.As recently as August, Yorke said a reunion was \"not on the cards from where I'm sitting\".All of which makes the decision to play in the round, packed like sardines in a crushed tin can, all the more significant.The group are symbolically returning to the rehearsal room, playing off each other as much as they are playing to the audience.Yorke glides across the stage, doing that dance he does, moving from acoustic guitar to electric piano and back again. During Idioteque, guitarist Ed O'Brien catches him mid-transit, and they holler the lyrics directly to one another. At the start of Jigsaw Falling Into Place, Yorke and Greenwood face each other and play duelling guitars.It suggests the tour has been an act of healing, even if the band have been assigned separate dressing rooms for the first time in their career.Whether that leads to anything more is still up for debate. \"We haven't thought past the tour,\" Yorke recently told the Times. \"I'm just stunned we got this far.\"The delighted fans who queued for the Tube home singing Karma Police will be hoping everything is in its right place for a fully-fledged comeback.Full setlistPlanet Telex2 + 2 = 5Sit Down, Stand UpLuckyBloom15 StepThe GloamingKid ANo SurprisesVideotapeWeird Fishes/ArpeggiIdiotequeEverything in Its Right PlaceThe National AnthemDaydreamingJigsaw Falling Into PlaceBodysnatchersThere ThereEncore:Fake Plastic TreesLet DownParanoid AndroidYou and Whose Army?A Wolf at the DoorJustKarma Police",

    "body": "44 minutes agoPhilippa Roxby,Health reporter and Alison Holt,Social affairs editorGetty ImagesDetails of a new UK clinical trial to assess the risks and benefits of puberty-blocking drugs in children who question their gender have been announced.It follows the banning of the drugs for gender treatment last year after a major review raised concerns about the lack of clinical evidence over their safety for under-18s.Researchers from King's College London say the trial will involve around 220 children under the age of 16 who are going through puberty, and will examine the impact of the drugs on their physical, social and emotional wellbeing.Some clinicians and campaigners question whether the trial is ethical.Prof Emily Simonoff, study leader and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London (KCL), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that young people and their parents attending services for gender distress \"tell us that they don't know what to do - they look at the information that's out there and they don't know what's best for them\".But she said the study was not expecting a \"one size fits all finding\".\"We are looking very much at the balance between, possibly, benefits for mental health and quality of life, and any possible risks or harms.\" She added this would include monitoring people's physical health, and would also be the first ever study looking at the impact on brain development. Puberty blockers, also known as puberty suppressing hormones (PSH), are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening.They were used to treat some young people with gender incongruence - when someone's gender identity doesn't match the sex they were registered at birth - or with gender dysphoria, when it causes significant distress.As a result of the uncertainty over the safety of the drugs, highlighted by the Cass review into gender care, led by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, doctors can now only offer the treatment to under-18s as part of a research study.Last year, the government brought in a UK-wide indefinite ban on the drugs being prescribed privately or by the NHS to children and young people questioning their gender identity.The new clinical trial, called Pathway, will involve children who are currently accessing gender services and have a diagnosis of gender incongruence.They will all have reached puberty, but will be younger than 16 - and will have to meet strict criteria, undergo intensive medical and psychological screening before they are allowed to start taking puberty blockers.A team of specialist NHS doctors must have a full picture of the young person's wellbeing before deciding if they think they are suitable for the treatment.The young person will also have to show they have a good enough understanding of the potential impact of taking puberty blockers to give their consent, and their parent or legal guardian will need to agree. They will be provided with ongoing psychological support.To explore the impact of the drugs, the researchers plan to start one group on the treatment straight away and another group 12 months later. The children in these groups will be chosen randomly.The KCL researchers said there would be no minimum age for taking the drugs, but puberty normally starts around the age of 11 for girls and 12 for boys.The trial will look at issues such as bone density, brain development and mental health and wellbeing over time.The research team said the trial had been given ethical approval and was expected to start in January, with five to six children recruited every month. The first results should be available in around four years.Alongside this, a larger observational study involving 3,000 children will research different types of support and how effective they are.The puberty blockers trial has already proved controversial, with campaigners threatening legal action.Keira Bell, who took the Tavistock gender clinic to court in 2020 after she was given puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones as a teenager, said the trial should be halted immediately. If it is not, she says she and another campaigner will start judicial review proceedings at the High Court.She said it was \"disgusting\" that children were being put on the drugs when they had already been banned because they were \"unsafe\".In her case, the High Court ruled that under-16s were \"unlikely to be able to give informed consent\" to puberty blockers, but this was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled that doctors can judge whether young people can give consent to the treatment.Some clinicians from the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender, which campaigns for rigorous science and improved treatment options for gender-questioning people, have also questioned whether the trial can be carried out ethically. Study lead Prof Simonoff said: \"We know there are ongoing societal discussions about gender transition, but this research is focused solely on informing and improving healthcare by better understanding how to support the physical and mental health of young people with gender incongruence.\"Dr Hilary Cass said she was \"really pleased\" Prof Simonoff and the KCL team were undertaking the trial.She said: \"My review uncovered a very weak evidence base for benefits from the use of puberty blockers for children and young people with gender dysphoria. In fact, some children had more negative than positive effects.\"However, given that there are clinicians, children and families who believe passionately in the beneficial effects, a trial was the only way forward to make sense of this.\"She added: \"Although a lot of media attention has focused on the trial, they have a much broader research programme. Following the outcomes for young people who do not elect for a medical pathway will be just as important as following those who do.\"A spokesperson for charity Stonewall, which campaigns for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, said all young people should have access to the very best medical care, guided by evidence.\"We urge the government and policymakers to invest in delivering excellent healthcare for trans young people and to make sure the voices of trans young people and their families are at its core.\"",

    "body": "16 minutes agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,in Washington, and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, in WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican.One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud.After the US president labelled her a \"traitor\", she said in a video announcing her departure: \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he later wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!\"Greene said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.She said that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms\". She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has since become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down living costs for voters and criticised his policy of introducing tariffs on imports. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, with a growing number of Republicans calling for their release, Trump reversed course and said he would support their publication. He signed a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\". AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024While she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, US media reports have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat. The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, where the party only holds a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

    "body": "5 days agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to film-makers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Film-maker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "2 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "The Christian converts the US is deporting back to Iran9 hours agoLeyla KhodabakhshiGetty ImagesPastor Ara Torosian says Iranian Christians fear what will happen to them if deported back to IranOne Monday in mid-October, after a year in US immigration detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.They told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".Are Christians being persecuted in Nigeria as Trump claims?A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported have had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.A rare deportation flightAs the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers. In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.US deporting 120 Iranians after deal struck with Tehran, Iran saysDetained in immigration raids, Maga mom still has faith in Trump's mass deportation planWhy returning is dangerous for Christian convertsConverts from Islam make up a significant share of Iran's 800, 000 Christian population, says Steve Dew-Jones of Article 18, a UK-based advocacy group that monitors violations against Christians in the country.With officially recognised churches tightly restricted, house churches have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.Iran: The Christians celebrating Easter in secretArrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.But it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"Life on hold for those left behindAsylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.After their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"Submitted photoA screenshot of the video filmed by Pastor Ara, showing Reza and Marjan being detained by immigration enforcementPastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.He says they entered legally through a humanitarian programme and had work authorisations. \"How can it be dangerous for the wife but not for the husband?\" asks pastor, Ara Torosian, who himself fled Iran in 2010 after being detained for smuggling Bibles.Majid, who managed to slip through the airport in Turkey, has been living in limbo since, while his lawyer follows up on his case. His wife, whose asylum case is still pending, now lives in Los Angeles with their 1.5-year-old daughter - a child who has never met her father.In the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran? If they deport me, I could go to prison the moment I land.\"Unable to work legally or open a bank account. He first stayed with a distant relative \"just until my wife's case was resolved,\" but she was never released and, after nearly a year in detention, was deported. A small church later offered him temporary shelter.\"Anytime they ask me to leave, I have to sleep in parks,\" he says.He is awaiting an immigration hearing but sees no good outcome. His wife has received another summons from Iranian intelligence.\"If they arrest her and demand I return,\" he says quietly, \"I'll have no choice.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoDan WhitworthStockton-on-TeesBBCJoan Holdaway had £1,000 stolen after being bombarded with phone calls from scammersVictims of fraud are being failed by the criminal justice system, charities are warning, as new analysis suggests only a fraction of reports result in a prosecution.There were 1.2 million recorded cases of fraud in England and Wales in the 12 months to June, data from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau shows. But in the same time frame fewer than 13,000 cases were prosecuted, Ministry of Justice figures show.Wayne Stevens, the national lead for fraud at charity Victim Support, said: \"Our experience is that victims get a pretty poor deal from the criminal justice system as a whole.\" The Home Office said it would publish \"an ambitious fraud strategy in the New Year.\"The true scale of fraud could be much larger. There were 4.1 million estimated instances of fraud in the 12 months to June this year, according the Office for National Statistics' Crime Survey for England and Wales, which can include crimes that were not reported to the police.Joan Holdaway, 85, shared her experience as part of the BBC's Scam Safe Week from 22 to 28 November.She had £1,000 stolen after being bombarded with phonecalls from fraudsters using photos of celebrities to promote their investment scam online.\"It was very upsetting,\" said Ms Holdaway. \"All I kept thinking about was how I was going to eke out the money that I'd still got. Then I kept thinking 'I'm not going to get this back, I know I'm not.'\"She contacted the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, Action Fraud, which put her in touch with Cleveland Police. Officers referred her to the Victim Care and Advice Service which helped her to be reimbursed by her bank under fraud rules introduced just over a year ago. Known as the mandatory reimbursement requirement it obliges banks to refund most victims of push payment fraud - when victims are  tricked and manipulated into transferring money to criminals themselves.No one has been prosecuted in Ms Holdaway's case and she told the BBC the emotional and mental impact had been tremendous.\"It's made me very, very suspicious. You just cannot sleep properly and it's just on your mind all the time. All I was doing was avoiding ever speaking to anyone again.\"I don't think you ever get over it really... I think it stays with you... and you wonder anybody that you don't know, are they who they say they are? It's really dreadful.\"Matt Allwright introduces BBC Scam SafeMr Stevens said Victim Support was concerned people were not taken seriously when they report fraud to the bank or police.\"If the fraud has an international dimension the fraud often isn't investigated,\" he said.\"Until recently victims often didn't get reimbursed the money that was lost to criminals.\"He said Victim Support was calling for improved campaigns to raise public awareness about the real risks of fraud. It also called for greater cooperation between banks and social media companies where fraud can take place.UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: \"Protecting customers is a top priority and banks invest billions in advanced systems to help detect and stop fraud happening in the first place.\"The Home Office said in a statement fraud was \"a serious and damaging crime that can affect anyone, at any time, and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice\".A spokesperson added: \"In the new year we will publish an ambitious Fraud Strategy, which will reduce fraud, target offenders and protect victims.\"After a 30 year career with the police Dave Mead now helps run the Victim Care and Advice Service charity in Stockton-on-Tees which has managed to get nearly £700,000 refunded to fraud victims so far this yearOne charity in Stockton-on-Tees is on the front line in the fight against fraud offering help, support and advice for thousands of victims every year.Dave Mead helps run the Victim Care and Advice Service, VCAS.\"A big, big chunk of our work and some of our most challenging work is fraud,\" he said. \"The figures are eye-watering. We're contacting between 500 to 800 victims of fraud every month.\"The vast majority of victims don't report fraud [and] we find some. But we've got to get into the communities through elderly groups, faith groups, youth groups.\"We've got to raise the conversation.\"Vicky Beaumont spends her days offering help and support to victims of fraud as well as fighting for their rights and challenging banks about reimbursing victimsVicky Beaumont is an advice and support worker for VCAS.\"To be honest, even though I help people and speak to people day in day out, it's still hard to see them [victims] relive that emotion.\"[But] it's so rewarding, it's such a good job to do to be able to support people like that and get great results for them. I would do this all day everyday.\"BBC's Scam Safe Week content across BBC TV, Radio, iPlayer, Sounds and Online from 22 to 28 November 2025",

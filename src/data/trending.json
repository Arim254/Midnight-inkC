    "body": "An explosion has killed at least eight people and injured 18 others during Friday prayers inside a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs, the health ministry has said.Pictures from Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, show the inside of the Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque with black, scorched walls, smashed windows and blood on the carpet.Officials believe that an explosive was detonated inside the building, Sana reports, citing a security source. While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah has claimed responsibility.The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing in a statement on X that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it claimed responsibility for a deadly church bombing in Damascus, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.In March, security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring ",

    "body": "15 minutes agoRaffi BergMagen David AdomThe attacker drove into people and then carried out a stabbing several miles away, police sayTwo people have been killed in what police say was a \"rolling terror attack\" in northern Israel.Police said the attacker ran over a pedestrian in the eastern city of Beit Shean, then drove on before stabbing a woman near Ein Harod, about 8 miles (12.5km) to the west.A 68-year-old man was killed and a 16-year-old boy was hurt in the ramming, officials said, whilst the stabbing victim was an 18-year-old woman.The suspect was eventually shot and wounded later by a civilian outside the city of Afula, according to police.A day before the attack, an Israeli reservist was fired after video emerged of him ramming a praying Palestinian with a quad bike. The suspect in Friday's attack came from the village of Qabatiya, in the northern occupied West Bank, Israel's defence minister said.Following the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was preparing to carry out an operation in the Qabatiya area. Defence Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the IDF to act \"forcefully and immediately\". The IDF said the suspect had \"infiltrated into Israeli territory several days ago\".Israel's Kan News public broadcaster said the 37-year-old man had been working illegally in Israel and had used his employer's vehicle in the attack. The incident comes a day after an Israeli army reservist drove a quad bike into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the occupied West Bank.Video shows the man, dressed in civilian clothes but with a firearm, ramming the victim with the vehicle. Reports say the victim was unhurt. The Israeli military said the soldier - who had earlier opened fire in a nearby village - had been fired and his weapon confiscated.Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have surged in the West Bank in recent years, according to the United Nations, with more than a thousand killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel of 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "2 hours agoLauren TurnerPA MediaThe King's Christmas Broadcast was the most-watched TV programme in the UK on Christmas Day, overnight data has shown.Nearly 7m tuned in on the BBC, ITV, Sky News and GB News to watch King Charles deliver his annual message, this year recorded in Westminster Abbey.After the King, the next most popular show was The Scarecrows' Wedding on BBC One, watched by 4.3m. It is based on the picture book by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler, who wrote and illustrated The Gruffalo. All figures are based on \"overnight\" TV ratings - which do not include viewers who watch Christmas specials on catch-up services during the rest of the festive period.The King used his traditional speech to invoke the wartime spirit, urging people to get to know their neighbours and \"never lose sight\" of the values in which communities came together \"in the face of such great challenge\".The figures also do not include the small number watching the King's message on Sky Showcase, Sky Mix HD or other non-TV platforms.Strictly Come Dancing's Christmas Special - which saw Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman host the show together for the final time - was the third most popular programme, with 4.2m tuning in.They ended the festive special with their \"keep dancing!\" catchphrase, with Winkleman saying the audience watching over the years had \"meant a world to us\". There was a drop in viewers for EastEnders however, eighth most-watched this year with 2.85m for the first of its two Christmas Day episodes. The second did not make the viewing figures top 10. Soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale, both on ITV1, did not make the top 10 with their Christmas Day episodes. This year, BBC programmes made up nine of the top 10 most-watched programmes across the day. A festive episode of the 1% Club, the quiz hosted by Lee Mack, on ITV1, was in ninth place with 2.75m watching.The BBC's chief content officer Kate Phillips said this was \"a timely reminder that shared moments really do still matter even in a world of so much choice\".

    "body": "Thailand carried out air strikes on a disputed border area with Cambodia on Friday, as officials from both sides continued talks to try to end fighting.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people.Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed.Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border.Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post.Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\".It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed.\"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\"The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years.But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on 24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Diogo Jota joined Liverpool from Wolves in 2020 The sons of former Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Diogo Jota will accompany the mascots when the Portuguese's two former sides meet at Anfield on Saturday. Dinis and Duarte, two of Jota's three children, will join the matchday mascots on the pitch before kick-off. Jota, 28, was killed in a car crash in Spain in July, alongside his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva. The Portugal winger joined Liverpool in 2020 after three seasons with Wolves. Saturday's Premier League fixture at 15:00 GMT is the first time that the two teams have met since Jota's death. In his programme notes before Liverpool's final home fixture of 2025, manager Arne Slot said he hopes the affection Jota is held in can bring his family \"solace\". \"Reflecting on everything that has happened over the last 12 months ignites a rollercoaster of emotions but it is normal at this time of year to look back to everything that has happened,\" said Slot. \"Doing so leads me to think especially of the family of Diogo Jota on what will be their first Christmas without him. \"It is not my place to tell them where they should look for comfort – if that is even possible – but I can only hope that the feeling of love and affection that Diogo still generates brings them some solace.\" Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and League Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.The forward joined Wolves on an initial season-long loan deal from Atletico Madrid in 2017 and went on to score 44 goals in 131 appearances.

    "body": "54 minutes agoJaroslav LukivandSean SeddonUS Department of DefenseThe US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vesselThe US has launched strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold. Camps run by the group in Sokoto state, which lies on Nigeria's border with Niger, were hit, the US military said, adding that an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities.US President Donald Trump said the Christmas Day strikes had been \"deadly\" and labelled the group \"terrorist scum\", saying it had been \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" using intelligence provided by Nigeria. He also did not rule out further strikes. Referencing the timing of the strikes - which took place late on Thursday - he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas, it could be any other day - it is to do with attacking terrorists who have been killing Nigerians\". The Nigerian government has for years been fighting an array of jihadist groups, which includes Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but largely in the north-east, hundreds of miles away from Sokoto state.A resident in the village of Jabo, Haruna Kallah, told AFP news agency: \"We heard a loud explosion which shook the whole town and everyone was scared.\" Another local resident, Umar Jabo, told BBC News : \"Everyone thought it was a plane. It crashed in fields.\"His comment was backed up by social media images that showed people standing in a field filming the burning aftermath of the attack.Umar Jabo denied any IS fighters had been killed: \"Here in Jabo, we live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\"The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated.Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November.At the time, an adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu told BBC News that militants had targeted people \"across faiths\", and said any US military action should be carried out jointly. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, with about 220 million people, divided roughly evenly between Christian and Muslims.In a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". \"Merry Christmas!\" he added, writing on X.The Pentagon later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship.Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern BornoOn Friday morning, the Nigerian foreign ministry said authorities were engaged in \"security co-operation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism\".\"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,\" the statement added.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people.Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world.Nigerian human rights lawyer and conflict analyst Bulama Bukati speculated that Thursday's strikes had targeted a relatively new IS-aligned splinter group, which originated in the Sahel region and has recently moved its fighters to Nigeria.The largest IS-linked group in Nigeria - Islamic State West Africa Province - operates in the north-east of the country, he told BBC World Service, while the smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state. He continued: \"They started slipping into Nigeria in 2018 but over the past 18 months or two years they established camps in Sokoto state and Kebbi state.\"They have been launching attacks and imposing their social laws over people in Sokoto state over the past 18 months or so.\"Local lawmaker Bashar Isah Jabo was adamant that the village had no IS or Lakurawa members at all, and he said the area where the missile fell was less than 500m (1,600ft) from a hospital.According to BBC Monitoring, a pro-IS social media channel has been reporting on regular US reconnaissance flights in Sokoto, as well as in the north-eastern state of Borno, where the Nigeria's largest IS-linked group has its stronghold. The Nigeria strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery had struck more than 70 targets. Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush. ",

    "body": "Zelensky plans to meet Trump on Sunday for talks on ending Russian war26 minutes agoSean SeddonEPA/ShutterstockUkraine's president last met President Donald Trump at the White House in OctoberUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida at the weekend, as talks continue on ending Russia's full-scale war.Zelensky said he expected the meeting to take place on Sunday and to focus on a US-brokered 20-point peace plan, as well as separate proposals for US security guarantees.Meanwhile, the Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin's senior aide has held further talks with US officials over the phone, and that Russia has committed to continuing with the negotiations.Russia has spoken of \"slow but steady progress\" in talks but has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from the eastern Donbas, if Russia pulls back too.Ukraine has sought to secure guarantees from the US as part of a deal, and Zelensky has suggested that a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" is a potential option for areas of Donbas that Russia has failed to take by force.On Friday, Zelensky told reporters that the 20-point plan was 90% complete: \"Our task is to make sure everything is 100% ready.\"He wrote on social media: \"We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the new year.\"Shortly after details of the talks emerged, the mayor of Ukraine's major northeastern city, Kharkiv, said two people had been killed and several others wounded in a Russian air strike.ReutersUkrainian soldiers were pictured eating a Christmas meal together as fighting continued along the front line Zelensky has met Trump several times this year, since an initial White House meeting in February descended into a hostile shouting match. Their most recent meeting at the White House in October was far more amicable.Confirmation of planned top-level talks came after the Ukrainian leader said he had spoken to Trump's chief negotiators, special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, for an hour over the phone on Christmas Day.He said the latest round of negotiations had generated \"new ideas\" on how to end the war, and described it as a \"really good conversation\". The White House has proposed establishing what would in effect be a demilitarised zone in eastern Ukraine where both sides agree not to deploy troops - a compromise that would avoid settling the intractable question of legal ownership over the contested territory. Zelensky signalled on Wednesday that if Ukraine were to pull back by up to 40km (25 miles) from the front line in the east to create an economic zone, then Russia would have to do the same from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's industrial heartland in the Donbas.Ukraine has secured a number of changes to an earlier 28-point draft plan, which was formulated by Steve Witkoff but widely seen as being favourable to Russia.Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the weekend talks in Florida would focus on several documents, including US security guarantees and a separate economic agreement.However, Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of territory has proved to be the most difficult issue to resolve, along with the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.The White House has proposed Ukraine and Russia split the energy generated by the plant, the largest in Europe. Russian troops currently control it.Russia is unlikely to agree to a number of points in the updated US plan, especially its territorial proposals. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused \"groups of states, primarily Western European\" of seeking to derail the diplomatic progress that had been made.Putin has demanded full control of Donbas, including 25% of the Donetsk region that it has not occupied.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed further talks would take place between Russian and American delegations, following last weekend's meeting between US negotiators and a delegation led by Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev in Miami.Another close aide, Yuri Ushakov, had held further talks with the White House over the phone, and more were planned, Peskov added.Zelensky outlined the latest version of the plan this week, the first time since the original 28-point draft was leaked in November.Latest proposals commit the US and Europe to providing security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5, committing allies to providing military support in the event Russia launches a renewed invasion. The deal would also see Ukraine's military maintained at 800,000 personnel, a level the Kremlin has demanded be cut.Meanwhile, fighting and aerial strikes have continued, with casualties in the central city of Uman as well as Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv.Ukraine's air force said on Friday it had shot down 73 drones overnight.Russia also said it had shot down Ukrainian drones and missiles, including British Storm Shadows. Ukraine's air force said it had struck oil and gas refineries in Rostov and Krasnodar. ",

    "body": "10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed.The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech.The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content.Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \"punish American viewpoints they oppose\".Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned.In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order.The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard.The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment.When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\"Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\"His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said.In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending.

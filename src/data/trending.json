One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "Technology giant Meta is set to trial premium subscriptions for Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users in the coming months in its latest experiment with paid services.The new offerings would give access to features including expanded artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.Under the plan, access to the platforms' core services would remain free to use.The firm also plans to test subscriptions for features, such as its Vibes video generation app, which Meta says \"can bring your ideas to life with new AI visual creation tools\".The company announced Vibes in September as part of the latest version of the Meta AI app.It also aims to use Manus, a Chinese-founded AI firm it agreed to buy in December for a reported $2bn (£1.46bn), in its subscription plans, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the story.Meta will also continue to offer standalone Manus subscriptions to businesses.At the time, the firm said the deal would help improve its own AI by giving people access to \"agents\" - tools which can do complex things with minimal user interaction such as planning trips or making presentations.\"Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including Meta AI,\" it said in a blog post.Based in Singapore after relocating from China, Manus has sought to set itself apart from rival AI developers with what it claims can be a \"truly autonomous\" agent.Unlike many chatbots which need to be repeatedly asked for things before a user can get their desired response, Manus says its service can plan, execute and complete tasks independently in accordance with instructions.In January, Beijing said it would investigate the Meta deal to assess whether it broke China's technology export laws or national security regulations.Last year, Facebook tested placing a limit on how many links some users can share when they post on the social media platform.Notifications seen by some users based in the UK and US said they could only share a certain number of links in Facebook posts without a subscription.The company described it as \"a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value\" for subscribers.In late January, people in the UK were notified of a £2.99 monthly subscription to access ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.Following an announcement in September, UK Facebook and Instagram users will be prompted to choose between paying, or continuing to use the apps for free with personalised ads. EU users have a fee of €5.99 (£5) a month for the same service.In 2023, Meta started to roll out a paid verification service that gives Facebook and Instagram users a blue tick for a monthly fee.",

Writing on Instagram, Rachel Duffy said she was \"heartbroken\" at the death of her \"beautiful wee mummy\". On Friday, she became the first female Traitor to win the BBC show. Throughout the series, Duffy spoke about her mum's battle with Parkinson's Disease and also dementia.During the show, Duffy from Newry in Northern Ireland, had said she wanted to take her mum on holiday to create memories.Speaking to BBC News NI following her win, she said she was looking forward to treating her family, and her mum in particular. \"I rang my mummy this morning… I can't wait to come home and give her a big hug and say what will we do?\"\"Anything you want let's go do it. As long as I get to spoil my family that's all I care about,\" she added.\"She [Rachel's mum] didn't get all the twists and the turns but she's enjoyed watching it. She's very proud.\"Wanted to win 'for mummy'Duffy, as well as her co-traitor Stephen, managed to win the competition in Friday night's final to take home half of the show's £95,750 prize pot.Rachel opened up about her mum during her time on the show, and in the final episode, she became emotional as she talked about how she wanted to spend the prize money making memories with her family.\"When you know her [Rachel's mum] memories are going and you have an opportunity to help her create the nicest ones ever, that is very precious,\" she said. Speaking after the final, Rachel's sister Joanne said how she wished to spend her winnings showed her sister's true character.\"Because Rachel wanted to get in there and get that money for mummy and, what she wanted it for, meant that it meant so much more than just the money.\"In a statement on social media, Rachel asked for privacy as her family \"grieves during this difficult time\".'Not easy to speak publicly' The chief executive of Dementia UK Hilda Hayo has offered condolences to the family and praised Rachel for \"candidly sharing her experience of dementia, and helping to raise awareness of the condition\". \"We thank Rachel for her honesty, we know it is not easy to speak publicly about the impact dementia can have, but in doing so she will have encouraged others to reach out for the support they need,\" she said in a statement.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterValve Corporation will face a £656m lawsuit in the UK over alleged unfair prices on its global online store, Steam, following a tribunal ruling that the case could continue.The gaming giant is being accused of abusing its market dominance by imposing restrictive terms on game publishers and locking players into using Steam, the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.The legal action was brought by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt in 2024 on behalf of up to 14 million Steam users across the UK, who could be in line for compensation if she wins.Valve, which has been contacted for comment, had argued the case should not be certified to proceed towards a trial.The lawsuit - filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London - alleges Valve \"forces\" game publishers to sign up to conditions which prevents them from selling their titles earlier or for less on rival platforms.It claims that as Valve requires users to buy all additional content through Steam, if they've bought the initial game through the platform it is essentially \"locking in\" users to continue making purchases there.This, Ms Shotbolt argues, has enabled Steam to charge an \"excessive commission of up to 30%\", making UK consumers pay too much for purchasing PC games and add-on content.The case is what is known as a collective action claim, which means that one person goes to court on behalf of a much larger group of people.In this instance, it has been brought on behalf of up to 14 million people in the United Kingdom who bought games or additional content through Steam or other platforms since 2018.The claim is backed by legal firm Milberg London LLP, which brings group action cases against large companies.A separate consumer action case, filed in August 2024, has been brought against Valve in the US.Starting out as a developer of award-winning titles such as Half-Life, Valve launched Steam in 2003.According to VG Insights, over 19,000 games were released on the platform in 2025 alone, generating a revenue of $11.7bn (£8.6bn).The company has also branched out into creating its own hardware such as the Steam Deck in 2022, a portable, handheld gaming computer that allows users to play Steam games on the go.Valve recently announced it was also releasing a new console rival to Nintendo, XBox and PlayStation in the Steam Machine, designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV.",

    "body": "Aston Villa have made a fresh enquiry to re-sign former midfielder Douglas Luiz on loan.The 27-year-old is currently on loan at Nottingham Forest from Juventus, but could leave the City Ground before Monday's transfer deadline. Chelsea are also interested in the Brazil international but sources have told BBC Sport his preference is Villa, where he made 204 appearances between 2019 and 2024.Villa sold Luiz to Juventus for £42.5m in June 2024 to help solve their profit and sustainability problems, but he made just three Serie A starts before joining Forest in August 2025.Luiz's loan to Forest will turn into a permanent move if he makes a certain number of appearances but he has not done so yet.Villa boss Unai Emery is looking to bolster his midfield options, with captain John McGinn out for up to two months with a knee issue and Boubacar Kamara expected to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury.Emery's side lost out on Conor Gallagher earlier this month after the England international opted to join Tottenham from Atletico Madrid for £35m.Villa are third in the Premier League - four points behind leaders Arsenal - and have qualified for the Europa League last 16 with one league-phase game to spare.Villa are also expected to complete the £18m signing of striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas imminently after the striker had a medical in the UK.The Turkish side activated an £11.2m option to buy loanee Abraham from Roma on Monday and are now set to sell the 28-year-old to Villa.",

    "body": "6 hours agoRichard Wheeler,Political reporterandToby MannPAAndy Burnham is seen as a potential challenger for Labour Party leadership.Around 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter objecting to the decision to block Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham from standing in a forthcoming parliamentary by-election, BBC News understands.They have written to Sir Keir Starmer to warn the decision is a \"real gift\" to Reform UK, as polling suggests Burnham may be Labour's \"very best chance at winning\" the vacant Gorton and Denton seat.The signatories said there was \"no legitimate reason\" to block Burnham and asked for Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) to \"re-evaluate\".Sir Keir has said allowing Burnham to contest the seat would have diverted Labour's resources away from other important elections.\"Resources, whether that's money or people, need to be focused on the elections that we must have, not elections that we don't have to have,\" he said on Monday.The names of those who have signed the letter are not expected to be made public, though they are being communicated to the party leadership.The NEC, which includes Sir Keir, said blocking Burham would \"avoid an unnecessary mayoral election\" to replace him should he be successful in the by-election.The previous mayoral election in Greater Manchester costs taxpayers about £4.7m.Speaking on Tuesday, Housing Secretary Steve Reed said Labour critics of the move to block Burnham were \"entitled to their view\", but NEC officers had voted \"overwhelmingly\" in favour of the move. Burnham has been seen as a potential leadership rival to Sir Keir but would have to return to Parliament in order to mount a challenge.The letter was addressed to Sir Keir, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in her role as chair of the NEC, and Labour Party General Secretary Hollie Ridley.It said the decision to block Burnham had caused a \"huge amount of anxiety and anger\" amongst colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party and party members across the country.Around half a dozen Labour peers also signed the letter, the BBC has been told. Members of the NEC voted on Sunday morning to deny Burnham permission to stand in the contest.NEC sources told the BBC eight members of its 10 members had voted to block Burnham from running.Only Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell supported his push to run in the by-election, while Mahmood abstained.Burnham refused to comment when asked for a response to the NEC's decision.\"I've said what I needed to say and here I am back in my job. A full focus on my job as mayor of Greater Manchester,\" he told the BBC.When asked if he thought Sir Keir was scared of him, Burham held to his line.\"I'm not making any further comment,\" he said.He had said earlier he was \"disappointed\" by the move to block him and took a swipe at the Labour Party over how it was made public.Labour won Gorton and Denton in 2024 with a 13,000 majority.Reform UK and the Greens are both expected to pose a greater challenge this time round.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, former Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman said her parliamentary colleagues should move on and focus on winning the by-election, instead of discussing the decision to block Burnham.Burnham was elected as mayor of Greater Manchester in May 2024.His term runs until May 2028.The Gorton and Denton by-election is likely to be held on 26 February.",

    "body": "15 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul Seddon,Political reporterandJames ChaterBloomberg via Getty ImagesStarmer made the comments in an interview with Bloomberg held in Downing Street on MondaySir Keir Starmer has said the UK cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by China, as be prepares to become the first British prime minister in eight years to visit Beijing.In an interview with Bloomberg News, Sir Keir said his visit would bring \"significant opportunities\" for British companies.He insisted the UK would not be forced to \"choose between\" China and maintaining close ties to the US, amid rising trade tensions between the two superpowers in recent years.The UK would maintain \"close ties\" with the US on business, security and defence, he said,  but added that \"sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China... wouldn't be sensible\". Dozens of UK business leaders are expected to travel with the prime minister on the trip, the first by a British leader since Theresa May visited the country in 2018.The trip, which includes stops in Beijing and Shanghai, comes after a turbulent few weeks in relations between the US and its allies. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on allies for opposing his demand to take control of Greenland, and later provoked a backlash in the UK by saying Nato troops had stayed \"a little back\" from the front line in Afghanistan. Trump also threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country struck a trade deal with China. The trip comes days after the UK approved plans for a vast new Chinese embassy in London, amid criticism from opposition parties and local residents.The UK is waiting for its own £100m plan to redevelop the British embassy in Beijing to be approved by China's authorities.'Diplomatic tightrope'In the interview with Bloomberg, Sir Keir said: \"I'm often invited to simply choose between countries. I don't do that.\"\"We've got very close relations with the US – of course, we want to – and we will maintain that business, alongside security and defence,\" he said.Of the delegation travelling with him to China, Sir Keir added: \"They understand the opportunities that there are... That does not mean compromising on national security – quite the opposite.\"Sir Jeremy Hunt, who also visited China as foreign secretary during 2018, said Sir Keir was right to visit the country but it was important to remain \"clear eyed\" that China would have the strategic goal to \"prize apart\" the UK-US relationship.\"There is a real diplomatic tightrope that Keir Starmer has to walk here,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\"There will be some benefits of course from more trade with China, but there's also a huge amount of risk.\"Sir Keir suggested he would bring up disagreements with Beijing on human rights, including the fate of Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon found guilty of colluding with foreign forces in December, in a case critics say shows how Hong Kong's security laws have been used to silence political opposition.Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for Lai's release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.",

    "body": "9 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorBoth of Westminster's mega brands, Labour and the Conservatives, feel discombobulated and the discombobulator-in-chief is the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage.The thing that ties together the big political stories of the last few days – the stymied manoeuvring of the Greater Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, and the shimmying of Suella Braverman out of one party and into another – is the capacity of Reform to give their rivals the heebie-jeebies.Labour are experiencing an anxiety dream, bordering on cold panic, about the possibility of losing the next general election to Reform.It is Labour's anxieties about this very prospect which add rocket fuel to the drama surrounding Andy Burnham. Labour fretting about Reform's rise is what turbo-charges questions about Sir Keir Starmer's future as prime minister and so raises the profile of those seen by some as possible successors.Meanwhile, the Conservatives are witnessing something of an exodus in Reform's direction. It is now four significant defectors just this month.While anyone drawing up a list of potential Conservative defectors to Reform would have put Braverman near the top, this was still a big moment.She is a former Conservative home secretary, a big beast of recent Tory history.And her switch emphasises the momentum Reform are showing in draining the Conservative Party and in particular its Right: a fortnight ago it was former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, the week before last it was Robert Jenrick, a week ago it was Andrew Rosindell, now it is Suella Braverman.On stage at her defection, Braverman shared Reform's diagnosis that Britain is broken, a label the Conservatives disagree with. And like Jenrick before her, she offered a devastating critique of her former party's recent governing record.And all this at just the point Kemi Badenoch has been attracting warmer reviews from her colleagues.Meanwhile, within the Tory fold but outside the Commons, a new group called Prosper UK has launched.Some prominent names in the mix include former Home Secretary Amber Rudd and former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.These are Conservatives you would least expect to join Reform. Plenty of its supporters backed Remain, many but not all are roughly on the Left of the Conservative tradition. And they are arguing it is time for their voices to be heard once again. Where does this leave Badenoch as a figure of the Right?In short, both the Conservatives and Labour are contorted and strained right now.And let's not forget the questions too for Nigel Farage – not least the recurring one, about whether he leads a convention of cheesed off Conservatives.And whether, even with all the current noise and momentum, Reform really can build a viable prospective alternative government within just a few years.Doing so, Farage insists, has to involve recruiting people with experience of government, like Braverman.But to Reform's critics it dents their claim to run a fresh insurgency untainted by the failures of governments past.",

    "body": "The Hundred's inaugural player auction will be held in London on 11 and 12 March.For the first five editions of the competition, players were allocated to teams via a draft system with a set of salary tiers.But following substantial private investment in The Hundred, players not already signed or retained will now have their team and pay set by an auction.The shift to a system similar to the one used in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has been driven by new investors in the eight city-based franchises.Auctions are a feature of a number of T20 franchise leagues, with the IPL holding one since its inception in 2008, but this will be the first major instance in UK sporting history.Four of The Hundred's sides are now part-owned by groups that also control franchises in the IPL, which is reflected in the new team names of MI London, Sunrisers Leeds and Manchester Super Giants. The fourth, Southern Brave - backed by Delhi Capitals - have retained their original name.The women's auction will take place on 11 March with the men's auction 24 hours later.Squads will be made up of between 16 to 18 players, while there is a salary cap limit along with a salary collar, a minimum amount teams must spend.The salary pot in the men's competition for 2026 has risen by 45% to £2.05m per side, and the fund for women's teams has increased by 100% to £880,000.The minimum salary for a female player has also risen by 50% to £15,000, while the number of overseas players permitted in both competitions increases from three to four.Franchises were permitted to sign or retain up to four players each prior to the auction.Fixtures for the 2026 edition of The Hundred have also been announced.The opening men's and women's double-header will take place on 21 July at The Oval between MI London v Sunrisers Leeds, two franchises with IPL ownership links.A total of 64 matches, external take place in the group stage, split equally between the men's and women's competitions.The final round of group fixtures will be played on 12 August, with the Eliminator two days later and the final on Sunday, 16 August.Both the Eliminator and final will have reserve days in place in the event of bad weather.Every game will be live on BBC Sounds, with highlights on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website, plus 16 matches will also be available to watch live on BBC television.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJoshua Nevett,political reporterandTarah Welsh,housing correspondentPA MediaGround rents paid by leaseholders are to be capped at £250 a year in England and Wales, as part of UK government plans to make major changes to home ownership.The reforms also include proposals to ban the sale of new leasehold flats and give homeowners greater control over how their buildings are managed.Campaigners feared the government could drop the cap on ground rents - an annual fee leaseholders must pay to their freeholder - because of the potential impact on pension funds.But Labour MPs, including former Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, had urged the government to stick to Labour's manifesto promise to tackle \"unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges\".The reforms have been published in a draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill.Announcing the cap in a TikTok video, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the move would save some leaseholders \"hundreds of pounds\".\"That's really important because the cost of living is the single most important thing across the country,\" he said.Labour's 2024 election manifesto promised to \"finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end\".There are around five million leasehold homes in England and Wales, where people own the right to occupy a property via a lease for a limited number of years from a freeholder.Ground rents were abolished for most new residential leasehold properties in England and Wales in 2022, but remained for existing leasehold homes.It is common for a lease to include a clause that the ground rent doubles or increases by RPI inflation at fixed intervals, which can make it difficult to sell or get a mortgage for a property.The government says under its reforms, ground rent will ultimately be reduced to a peppercorn, effectively zero, after 40 years.Forfeiture, whereby leaseholders can lose their home and the equity they built up if they default on a debt as low as £350, will be abolished.The bill will also make it easier for existing leaseholders to convert to commonhold, which means occupants jointly own the ground a flat is built on as well as the building, without an expiring lease.The bill will now be scrutinised by MPs on the Housing Committee before making its way through Parliament, with the government saying the cap could come into force in late 2028.Treasury sources had previously acknowledged there were difficulties over where to draw the line over annual ground rent charges.Housing Secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast the government's reforms struck the right balance in a way that \"protects people's pensions but also protects leaseholders from unreasonable increases\".Relief and scepticismPhil Jones, 57, bought his two-bedroom leasehold flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, 25 years ago. His ground rent doubles every 10 years and is now at £500 per year.He says this makes his flat unsellable because mortgage companies will not lend on a property with a doubling ground rent clause in its lease.He described the announcement as a \"huge relief\" and said at least he can now think about selling his property.But he was hoping for ground rents to be capped at a peppercorn rate and said he was \"suspicious\" that the changes will be challenged by the freeholders.Phil pays a ground rent of £500 a year on his flatJade Kavanagh-Barnes said her ground rent of more than £700 has made it difficult to sell her leasehold flat in Manchester.She said she and her husband moved to Kent, thinking they would not have any issues selling the Manchester flat.\"We've now ended up with two mortgages which was never the plan and difficult to maintain,\" she told the BBC.Jade said she feels \"stuck\" and welcomed the government's leasehold reforms as a \"positive step\".\"Hopefully it will appease the freeholders and pension funds enough for them to not block it with court and appeals,\" she added.Jade Kavanagh-BarnesJade Kavanagh-Barnes and her husband are struggling to sell their leasehold flatThe Residential Freehold Association, which represents professional freeholders, said capping ground rent was \"wholly unjustified\" and warned over the impact on the UK's reputation for investors.A spokesperson said the bill \"will tear up long-established contracts and property rights, which are pillars of the UK's investment reputation\".Campaigners had called for a cap, saying that escalating ground rents had left leaseholders struggling to sell their homes.However, some had wanted the government to go further and limit ground rent to a peppercorn rate - effectively zero.Harry Scoffin, founder of campaign group Free Leaseholders, said: \"If leaseholders are paying for nothing, they should be paying nothing today, not in 2068.\"The National Leasehold Campaign said while it was disappointed at the government's decision not to enforce immediate peppercorn ground rents, it welcomed the cap.\"It's also encouraging that the government recognises that monetary ground rents must end,\" said Jo Darbyshire, the group's co-founder. \"However, 40 years is an incredibly long time to wait for peppercorn ground rents.\"Many leaseholders also complain of high service charges, which they have no control over and must pay for the management and maintenance of their building.The government says its leasehold reforms will build on planned changes to make service charge bills clearer and help people challenge unfair costs.An estimated 99% of flat sales in 2024 in England were leasehold.The English Housing Survey has estimated that in 2023/24, leasehold owner-occupiers reported paying an average annual ground rent of £304 a year.In 2024, when Labour were in opposition, the current Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said his preference was for ground rents to be capped at effectively zero.Writing in the Guardian earlier this month, Rayner said ministers were \"subjected to furious lobbying from wealthy investors\" trying to water down the commitment and warned people may lose faith if the party could not fix the \"obvious injustice\" with a cap.And last week, former Labour minister Justin Madders told the BBC the prime minister could face a \"mass rebellion\" if the government abandoned its pledge to cap ground rents.He said setting the limit at a peppercorn rate would be his preferred choice but that he could accept a £250 cap due to the \"risk of elongated legal challenge\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "6 hours agoEleri GriffithsBBC WalesSian ChathyokaMother-of-two Sian says that, before falling ill, she led a very active life, including swimming in the sea year-roundThe world has a population of more than eight billion - but only one known person can currently save Sian Chathyoka, who has a rare blood cancer.Sian, 56, said it was \"very difficult to be upbeat\" after being told last year she needed a stem cell transplant to survive, following a diagnosis of aggressive myelofibrosis. The mum-of-two was shocked to discover there was just one matching donor on the global register.Sian, a former social worker, is now preparing to receive a transplant from a \"selfless stranger\" and has urged others to sign up to become donors.Stem cell transplants offer \"the last chance of life\" for many blood cancer patients, according to the charity Anthony Nolan.Sian ChathyokaSian Chathyoka was diagnosed with myelofibrosis, a rare form of blood cancer, in September 2025Sian, from Swansea, led an active lifestyle before becoming ill, including cold water swimming, running the family campsite and caring for her children, aged 18 and 13.She first realised something was wrong when she was hit by \"extreme fatigue\" which left her struggling to get out of her chair.\"Since August, I've just been lying in bed because I've had no energy,\" Sian said.\"I've had such a level of fatigue, I haven't been able to do anything and it's been quite scary.\"When she noticed that she had lost 5lbs (2.3kg) without trying, Sian visited her GP and was sent for immediate blood tests.\"They came back and they were scattered all over the place,\" she explained. Further CT and MRI scans revealed an enlarged spleen and, in September 2025, she was diagnosed with myelofibrosis.\"I couldn't stop crying,\" she said. \"My condition is very rare - I am the only myelofibrosis patient they've got in Swansea and Cardiff and I've been told my disease is aggressive as well.\"When you take away the layers it's absolutely petrifying. But you've got to forget about that and be positive.\"Sian ChathyokaSian, who is preparing to receive a transplant from a \"selfless stranger\", is urging others to sign up to the stem cell registerSince her diagnosis, Sian has been undergoing treatment to shrink her enlarged spleen and receiving weekly blood and platelet transfusions. After learning a suitable donor had been found, Sian said she felt \"lucky\" and \"grateful that there is the possibility of a cure through a stem cell transplant\". However,she said she was surprised by how little people knew about stem cell donation.\"A lot of my friends didn't have a clue. That's why I want to raise awareness by sharing my story. \"Health is wealth and it is a luxury to be grateful for.\"What are stem cells and how are they donated?Stem cells are special cells that can change into other blood cells to be used to treat many different cancers, as well as immune deficiencies and genetic disorders, according to the NHS.Most stem cells are donated by giving blood at a specialist centre, but in roughly 10% of cases they need to be extracted from bone marrow during a hospital procedure.The Anthony Nolan and NHS Stem Cell Registry - which is formed of Anthony Nolan, DKMS UK, NHS Blood and Transplant and the Welsh Bone Marrow Donor Registry - has more than 2.3 million registered potential stem cell donors.The NHS says 30,000 potential new stem cell donors need to be recruited in the UK every year to meet demand.Sian is now working with Anthony Nolan to encourage more people to sign up and \"save a life\".\"Just signing up to the register, you can literally save a life. I feel really emotional because that's as powerful as it is,\" she added.Rowena Bentley, from Anthony Nolan, said Sian's story was helping to raise \"vital awareness\" of stem cell donation, adding that \"becoming lifesaver ready is easy\".More top storiesRelated linksGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

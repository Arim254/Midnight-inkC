    "body": "Scotland's mad for Oasis, Newcastle loves Sam Fender: Music tastes where you live revealed5 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCOasis are big in Manchester, but even bigger in Scotland. Newcastle is wild for homegrown guitar hero Sam Fender, and Liverpool can't get enough of female pop stars.These are some of the revelations from a breakdown of listening habits on Spotify and YouTube in 2025 in more than a dozen of the UK's biggest cities.Taylor Swift and Drake were the clear winners on Spotify - except in Newcastle, where Fender broke their stranglehold. He was one of several artists to prove particularly popular in their hometown, while there was a clear north-south divide in Oasis's popularity as they reformed.Eminem dominated YouTube in 2025, ahead of the KPop Demon Hunters singers and Ed Sheeran - with Taylor, Drake and other pop giants also among the most played artists.But a number of surprises emerged from the lists, too. Here are the rankings for each of the featured cities:BelfastGetty ImagesLady Gaga's songs were played a million times in Belfast in 2025There's a lot of love for Lady Gaga in Northern Ireland's capital - she was the second most popular artist of 2025 on YouTube in Belfast, higher than in any other UK city.She was pipped to number one by the stars of KPop Demon Hunters, with Eminem in third. The rapper missed YouTube's top spot in just two of the 14 featured cities (the other being Nottingham).Belfast's most played artists on YouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaEminemTaylor SwiftBruno MarsEd SheeranRihannaSabrina CarpenterCalvin HarrisEJAESurprise package: Belfast trance producer Billy Gillies was just outside the top 10, in 12th, and had two tracks in the city's top 20 songs of the year on YouTube - DNA (Loving You) at 10 and Right Here All Along at 17.NB Spotify did not provide data for Belfast.BirminghamWireImage/Getty imagesThe Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Chris Brown are all big in BirminghamDrake is the most-played artist on Spotify in Birmingham, and it is the only place outside London to also have his rival Kendrick Lamar in its top five.Brummie fans are the most devoted to US R&B singer Chris Brown - it's the only place to put him in its top 10 on Spotify (at nine), and also gives him his highest YouTube placing (at eight).D-Block Europe are big in Birmingham, too - the London-based hip-hop duo are second only to Eminem on the list of the year's most-played artists on YouTube, and it's also the only city to have them in its Spotify top 20 (at 15).Birmingham's most played artists on Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestRihannaBillie EilishChris BrownSZABirmingham's most played artists on YouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeAlka YagnikEd SheeranDrakeKaran AujlaArijit SinghChris BrownKPop Demon Hunters castRihannaSurprise packages: A string of Indian singers are bigger than many Western superstars on YouTube in Birmingham - Alka Yagnik was the third most popular act of 2025 overall with more than 7.5 million views in the city (above Ed Sheeran and Drake).Shake It To The Max by Ghanaian singer Moliy and Jamaican producer Silent Addy was also massive - it was the third most viewed track of the year on YouTube, higher than in any of the other featured locations.BristolGetty Images for The Recording AcademyOlivia Dean's highest rating outside London The tastes of fans on Spotify and YouTube differ a lot, judging by their charts. As in many cities, Taylor Swift was most popular on Spotify in Bristol, while Eminem topped the YouTube list.Bristol's listeners are, according to these rankings, the biggest fans of Olivia Dean outside her home city London, placing her ninth on the Spotify chart.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOlivia DeanAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndBillie EilishEJAESurprise package: It's the only place with any of BTS star Jung Kook's songs in the top 20 Spotify tracks, and he has two (3D at number 13 and Seven at number 18).CardiffGetty Images/Netflix/Getty Images for iHeartRadioEminem, KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran topped Cardiff's YouTube chartAs well as being number one on YouTube, Eminem was more popular on Spotify in the Welsh capital than in any other city, in ninth.Ed Sheeran is third on YouTube, behind KPop Demon Hunters, and also has his highest Spotify ranking, in 11th in Cardiff.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaBillie EilishEminemTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaD-Block EuropeThe WeekndChris BrownSurprise package: It was big everywhere, but Benson Boone's Beautiful Things had its joint highest ranking on YouTube in Cardiff (in third), and the city was the only place to put the song in its Spotify top 10 tracks (at 10) in 2025.EdinburghGetty ImagesOasis, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan were all popular in Scotland's capitalAs Oasis reunion fever gripped the nation last year, Scotland went particularly mad fer it. The band were in the top five most-played acts on both Spotify and YouTube in both Edinburgh and Glasgow - higher than anywhere else, including their home city of Manchester.Edinburgh also likes its pop - it's the only city with Chappell Roan in its top 10 on Spotify, while superstar DJ David Guetta was higher on YouTube than anywhere else. Edinburgh and Glasgow are also the only cities to put Gracie Abrams in their Spotify top 20s.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarChappell RoanThe WeekndTate McRaeYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranOasisKPop Demon Hunters castDavid GuettaRihannaBruno MarsLinkin ParkSurprise package: Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding 2015 cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence was just outside the top 10 most played songs on YouTube (in 11th).GlasgowGetty Images for ABA/Getty Images for SpotifyUS star Zach Bryan and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris proved popular in GlasgowTaylor Swift reigns on Spotify (again), while Glasgow gives Tate McRae her highest placing.It's also the only city where Scotland's superstar DJ Calvin Harris makes it into both the YouTube (11th) and Spotify (18th) lists.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestKendrick LamarZach BryanTate McRaeThe WeekndRihannaYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftKPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaOasisEd SheeranBruno MarsRihannaSabrina CarpenterDavid GuettaSurprise package: Scotland, it seems, is keen on country music - Glasgow is the only place with US superstar Zach Bryan in its Spotify top 10. Edinburgh is the only other UK city with him in its top 20, in 14th place.LeedsGetty Images for Live Nation/RedfernsBillie Eilish and D-Block Europe are among the most popular stars in Leeds, as elsewhereIn the absence of their own home town heroes (sorry Kaiser Chiefs), Leeds listeners are big on other northern acts - it's the only place outside Newcastle to have Sam Fender and the only place outside Sheffield to have the Arctic Monkeys in the Spotify top 10 (Oasis are also not far behind in 14th).Over on YouTube, D-Block Europe are big in Leeds - second to Eminem overall - their joint highest placing, alongside Birmingham.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestRihannaKendrick LamarArctic MonkeysSam FenderYouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeEd SheeranKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsDrakeThe WeekndSurprise packages: Chrystal's infectious The Days was a big hit, but nowhere bigger than in Leeds, where it was the third most played song of the year on YouTube with a million plays - closely followed by her collaboration with MK, Dior, at number four.LiverpoolWireImage via Getty ImagesSkye Newman performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool in MayLiverpool fans can't get enough of female pop stars, judging by these lists. Taylor Swift is top on Spotify, while Billie Eilish gets her joint highest position in fourth, and Ariana Grande gets her highest at number nine.Just outside the top 10, it's also Lady Gaga's joint highest Spotify placing (at 11) and Lana Del Rey's best position of any UK city (at 12).Meanwhile, rising British star Skye Newman was particularly popular on YouTube in Liverpool. She had two songs in the platform's top tracks of 2025 - Family Matters at eight and Hairdresser at 20.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaAriana GrandeTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranMazza L20RihannaCalvin HarrisThe WeekndSurprise package: Liverpool rapper Mazza L20 has crashed the YouTube top 10 in his home city above some global superstars. Real name Malcolm Graham, he was jailed in 2016 for possessing a handgun, before gaining attention online with viral hits like Murdaside.LondonWireImage/Parkwood via Getty ImagesJustin Bieber and Beyoncé only rated on the captial's listTaylor Swift was the most-played artist on Spotify in the UK overall, but Drake beat her to number one in the capital, while Olivia Dean and SZA were also more popular than the national average.Meanwhile, London was the only city to put Justin Bieber and Beyoncé in the Spotify top 20 (19th and 20th respectively).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestBillie EilishOlivia DeanSZAAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemArijit SinghEd SheeranDrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndD-Block EuropeBruno MarsLady GagaChris BrownSurprise package: Arijit Singh, one of India's biggest playback singers, was the second most popular musician of the year on YouTube in London. Singh, who released a duet with Ed Sheeran last year, racked up more than 40 million views in the capital, where he headlined a show at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in September.ManchesterHans Lucas via AFPThe Oasis reunion tour included five sold-out shows in Heaton Park, ManchesterBehind the big North American beasts (led by Drake and Taylor Swift, again), Manchester's (arguably) favourite musical sons Oasis were on repeat in their home city, being the fifth most played act overall on Spotify.That's their highest placing except for the Scottish cities - but the Gallagher brothers were absent from the lists in the south of England (London, Bristol and Southampton).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarRihannaEminemYouTube:EminemEd SheeranD-Block EuropeDrakeTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsThe WeekndArijit SinghSurprise package: The surprise is that Manchester seemingly went less KPop Demon Hunters crazy than elsewhere - the cast are absent from the top 10 YouTube artists (at 12th), and smash hit Golden only makes eighth, its lowest placing in any of the YouTube top songs charts.NewcastlePA MediaSam Fender has performed four stadium shows at the home of Newcastle United FC - two in 2023 and another two in 2025Tyneside's local hero Sam Fender isn't just big in the north-east, he's absolutely massive. The \"Geordie Springsteen\" played two huge hometown shows at St James' Park last summer and was the second most played artist on Spotify, behind the unmovable Taylor Swift. Beside Swift, he's the only person to have beaten Drake anywhere.What's more, Fender has four songs in Newcastle's top 20 Spotify tracks of the year - People Watching (number two), Seventeen Going Under (11), Arm's Length (15) and Hypersonic Missiles (16). None of his songs made the top 20 anywhere else.Spotify:Taylor SwiftSam FenderDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestBillie EilishRihannaKendrick LamarOlivia DeanYouTube:EminemEd SheeranLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsDavid GuettaLinkin ParkD-Block EuropeSurprise package: Scottish dance producer Blair Muir's track Rehab hasn't troubled the main UK charts, but was the 10th most played song of the year on YouTube in Newcastle.NottinghamGetty Images/NetflixBruno Mars and Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys was popular on YouTube, while  SZA made the Spotify listNottingham loves KPop Demon Hunters - the film's cast kept Eminem off the YouTube number one spot. The rap legend is a lowly third, behind Bruno Mars.Meanwhile on Spotify, fans in Nottingham were the only listeners outside London, Birmingham and Manchester to have played Drake more than Taylor Swift, and gave SZA her highest placing beyond London.Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaSZATate McRaeYouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsEminemEd SheeranLady GagaRihannaDrakeD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSurprise package: This is the only city to have preferred Soda Pop by Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys to Golden by their rivals Huntr/x, judging by their YouTube play counts. Soda Pop was second on Nottingham's list of most-played songs, with Golden fourth.SheffieldMyles Wright/ZUMA Press Wire via AlamyThe Arctic Monkeys last performed in Sheffield on June 9 and 10, 2023, with two headline homecoming gigs at Hillsborough ParkArctic Monkeys are another act to get a big hometown boost, coming fourth on the most-played list on Spotify, despite not having released an album or played live for a couple of years.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterArctic MonkeysThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOasisYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftRihannaThe WeekndDenon ReedSurprise package: Birmingham producer and DJ Denon Reed, who is \"leading the revival of bassline\", is in the top 10 most played acts on YouTube in Sheffield - the only city where he features.SouthamptonWireImage via Getty imagesSouthampton is the only city with Coldplay in its Spotify top 10, and also the only place with Bruno Mars in the service's top 20 (at 19).Billie Eilish gets her joint highest Spotify ranking in Southampton, along with Liverpool.

    "body": "5 hours agoMany of Sunday's papers continue their coverage of the fallout from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest on Thursday over suspicion of misconduct in public office. The Sunday Mirror leads with claims from the Royal Family's former head of protection that \"there was a conspiracy of silence\" over the former prince's relationship with disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Such claims prompted calls for an inquiry to discern \"who knew what and when?\" the paper writes.The ex-Royal's protection chief's \"calls to question 'silence' over Andrew scandal\" also leads the Sunday People.The Observer leads with a zoomed-in photograph of Andrew leaving the police station earlier this week, under the headline of \"nowhere to hide\" and \"monarchy in peril\". Former prime minister Gordon Brown \"demands civil servants face questions over taxpayer-funded flights\" used by Andrew to meet Epstein during his time as a \"trade envoy between 2001 and 2011\", the Sunday Telegraph reports. Brown wrote letters to six police forces urging \"a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's government work to Epstein\", the paper says.The Sunday Times says \"Metropolitan police officers were instructed to provide security for a celebrity dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein's New York home\", citing newly-released emails. According to the paper, the 2010 dinner party was held in Manhattan to honour Andrew, where \"two royal protection officers from Scotland Yard\" were stationed outside. \"Parliament should decide if Andy & Mandy have committed treason\", reads the Sun on Sunday's headline, leading with Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat's calls for an investigation into Andrew and former ambassador Peter Mandelson. The paper quotes Tugendhat's calls for a \"special committee\" to probe both men's \"links to Jeffrey Epstein\", which \"would have the power to summon witnesses and demand documents\". The Mail on Sunday reports \"King Charles was warned as long ago as 2019 that the Royal Family was being 'abused' by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's business associations\", quoting a whistleblower's emails to Buckingham Palace seen by the paper. It reports the emails tipped off the palace that \"the former Duke had secret financial links to controversial millionaire financier David Rowland\", as the emails \"threaten to draw Charles further into the crisis\". The BBC cannot verify the claims made by the Mail on Sunday and the former prince has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Melvyn Downes, the SAS Who Dares Wins star, leads the Daily Star on Sunday's front page with his criticism of Andrew, calling him \"arrogant and ignorant\". The paper reports that the TV star and author met the then-prince while serving as a soldier in the Staffordshire Regiment. The Independent leads with a \"harrowing dispatch\" from one of its journalists who  travelled to Nikopol, southern Ukraine, marking the four-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. \"The only place to hide from Putin's killer drones is our underground school\", reads the headline, featuring a photograph of teachers and students \"using a cellar as a makeshift classroom\".And finally, the Sunday Express leads with Dame Priti Patel's \"mission to save Chagos\". The shadow foreign secretary \"flies into Washington today on a mission to stop the Chagos Islands surrender,\" the paper writes, adding that if she succeeds in brokering a U-turn on the current deal, which Donald Trump opposes, it could cause \"fresh humiliation\" for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Iran students stage first large anti-government protests since deadly crackdown7 hours agoSiavash Mehdi-Ardalan,BBC PersianandJaroslav LukivScuffles break out at Sharif University in TehranStudents at several universities in Iran have staged anti-government protests - the first such rallies on this scale since last month's deadly crackdown by the authorities.The BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. Scuffles were later seen breaking out between them and government supporters. A sit-in was held at another Tehran university, and a rally reported in the north-east. Students were honouring thousands of those killed in mass protests in January.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.US and Iranian officials met in Switzerland on Tuesday and said progress had been made in talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme.But despite the reported progress, Trump said afterwards that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached with Iran or the US would take military action. The US leader has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\". Footage verified by the BBC shows hundreds of protesters - many with national Iranian flags - peacefully marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology at the start of a new semester on Saturday.The crowds chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and other anti-government slogans.Supporters of a rival pro-government rally are seen nearby in the video. Scuffles are later seen breaking out between the two camps.Verified photos have also emerged showing a peaceful sit-in protest at the capital's Shahid Beheshti University.The BBC have also verified footage from another Tehran university, Amir Kabir University of Technology, showing chanting against the government.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city in the north-east, local students reportedly chanted: \"Freedom, freedom\" and \"Students, shout, shout for your rights\".Sizeable demonstrations in other locations were also reported later in the day, with calls for further rallies on Sunday.It is not immediately clear whether any demonstrators have been arrested.Last month's protests began over economic grievances and soon spread to become the largest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people during that wave, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. Hrana also said it was investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Saturday's protests come as the Iranian authorities are preparing for a possible war with the US.The exiled opposition is adamantly calling on President Trump to make good on his threats and strike, hoping for a quick downfall of the current hardline government. But other opposition groups are opposed to outside intervention.The opposing sides have been involved in disinformation campaigns of social media, trying to maximise their conflicting narratives of what Iranian people want.Additional reporting by BBC Persian's Ghoncheh Habibiazad, and BBC Verify's Richard Irvine-Brown and Shayan Sardarizadeh.",

    "body": "Tories vow to lower interest on some student loansJust nowDamien Grammaticas,Political correspondentandHarry SekulichPA MediaConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party would cut the rate of interest charged on some student loans issued in the decade up to 2023.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Badenoch said the Plan 2 loans from that period \"increasingly feel like a scam\". An estimated 5.8 million people took out Plan 2 student loans between 2012 and 2023. The government is under pressure to reduce student debts, including from some Labour MPs, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has suggested it would be able to cut repayments on loans by lowering inflation.Loan interest is currently charged at the rate of Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns.Badenoch said she would cap the interest charged to RPI only, which is currently 3.8%, arguing it would help a higher number of students pay off their debts. The Conservative leader wrote: \"I am horrified at what graduates today are dealing with, and this is one of the reasons millions of young people feel they've been stitched up.\"The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government introduced Plan 2 loans in 2012 and tripled tuition fees to up to £9,000 a year. The Plan 2 loans were phased out across England in 2023 but still apply in Wales.Repayments for the loan begin once a graduate starts earning above £28,470 at roughly 9% of income earned above the threshold. Payments are largely deducted automatically through the tax system.The government announced the Plan 2 threshold would be frozen at £29,385 for three years from April, 2027.A freeze would mean workers earning above that amount will be dragged into making larger repayments on their student loans than if the thresholds had risen in line with inflation.Reeves defended the measure pledged in the November Budget, describing the student loan system as \"fair and reasonable\". Interest fees will decrease as inflation drops, Reeves said.However, some Labour MPs have criticised the Plan 2 system, including deputy leader Lucy Powell who called it \"unfair\" and \"egregious\" last week.The Liberal Democrats said the situation is \"appalling\" and the whole system needs to be \"rethought\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoImogen JamesReutersMPs on the Business and Trade Committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss launching an inquiry into the role of UK trade envoys following Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.The former prince was arrested by Thames Valley Police on Thursday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and released under investigation 11 hours later.The cross-party committee will discuss options after allegations that Andrew shared confidential government files while he was in the role, but will avoid focusing on him while he is involved in a police investigation.It comes as the government confirmed it is considering legislation to remove Andrew from the royal line of succession - he is currently eighth in line for the throne - amid pressure over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein; and he has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of millions of files in January connected to the late financier's case.On Saturday, several unmarked police cars were again seen at Andrew's former Windsor mansion Royal Lodge, where he lived for many years.Thames Valley Police is expected to continue searching the 30-room property, until Monday, the BBC understands.The discussions by MPs on the Business and Trade Committee will also look into the appointment and accountability of UK trade envoys.It is understood that any inquiry would start with a focus on possible governance issues within the wider system.There are currently 32 envoys across six continents, who play \"a crucial role in supporting the Department for Business and Trade's growth priorities\", according to the government website.Duties include engaging with host governments, leading trade delegations, and meeting businesses in the UK. Liam Byrne, chair of the committee, said earlier in the week that the MPs will also discuss a potential investigation into Andrew for his conduct in the role. MPs are taking the allegations \"acutely seriously\", Byrne said.Emails released in the latest tranche of files related to Epstein include claims that he have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein in 2010.Trade envoy role explained by BBC business editorSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, Defence Minister Luke Pollard said removing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession - which would prevent him from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Pollard said  the government had been working with Buckingham Palace on the plans, and hopes it will gain cross party support.Any action would require an act of Parliament, which would have to be approved by MPs and peers and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.It would also need to be supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where the King is head of state.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.The Liberal Democrats and the SNP say they would support government legislation to remove Andrew from the line of Royal succession.Following the latest revelations, historian David Olusoga told BBC Newsnight there is now \"a desperate desire within government and within the palace to draw a firewall… between this crisis and the wider monarchy\".",

    "body": "Final missing Lake Tahoe skier found dead 5 days after avalanche 3 hours agoChristal Hayes and Nardine SaadLos Angeles, California ReutersThe ninth and final missing skier has been found dead in California's Lake Tahoe backcountry, five days after a powerful avalanche struck several guides and a tight-knit group of friends on a trip. Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said on Saturday during a news conference that all nine bodies have now been recovered from the Castle Peak area in the Sierra Nevada mountains. She also released the names of all nine victims, which included close friends, a pair of sisters and three guides. Two people who were part of the group escaped the \"football-field sized\" avalanche - the deadliest in modern California history - and authorities said they might help piece together what happened.Sheriff Moon and others during the news conference described the harsh weather rescue crews were met with after the avalanche, and that white-out conditions stalled days of searching.Authorities said there was an ongoing avalanche risk after the Tuesday disaster and high winds prevented them from being able to utilize helicopters for days.When winds calmed on Friday, helicopters were used to pour water over the area - a tactic meant to mitigate an avalanche risk - authorities said. Crews were then sent to search for the ninth missing skier.The victims were confirmed on Saturday as: Carrie Atkin, 46, of Soda Springs, California; Lizabeth Clabaugh, 52, of Boise, Idaho; Danielle Keatley, 44, of Soda Springs and Larkspur, California; Kate Morse, 45, of Soda Springs and Tiburon, California; Caroline Sekar, 45, of Soda Springs and San Francisco, California; and Katherine Vitt, 43, of Greenbrae, California.The three Blackbird Mountain guides who died were identified as Andrew Alissandratos, 34, of Verdi, Nevada; Nicole Choo, 42, of South Lake Tahoe, California, and Michael Henry, 30, from Soda Springs.Earlier this week, a family spokesperson identified several of the skiers to the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\"While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,\" Moon said at the news conference.She said they relied on avalanche experts, who said the disaster spread across the size of an American football field and was nearly powerful enough to take out a house.Six members of the 15-person backcountry ski group were rescued early this week. The group was on its way back from a three-day guided ski trip in the backcountry when the avalanche struck, bringing with it eight feet (2.4 meters) of snow and 90 mph winds.Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown on Thursday told CBS that when the avalanche hit, the skiers went into what he called \"frantic mode\" to try to find their friends and partners.\"They were ultimately able to unbury three individuals who did not survive,\" Brown said.The Nevada County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that authorities are investigating whether there could be criminal negligence relating to the avalanche, CBS reported.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykEPA/ ShutterstockNasa has said that its 6 March launch day for its long-awaited lunar mission is now \"out of consideration\", after it spotted several last minute issues during routine checks that would prevent lift off. On Friday, the space agency said that its Artemis II mission, which would see astronauts sent to the moon for the first time in 50 years, would likely have the green light to launch within a matter of weeks. But NASA administrator Jared Isaacman announced on Saturday that setbacks would mean that further maintenance would have to be carried out. Four astronauts are preparing to be sent on the 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, marking humanity's furthest ever journey into space. Isaacman said he understood \"that people are disappointed by this development\", after almost 50-hours of checks on Thursday revealed no faults. The agency felt almost certain that its \"wet rehearsal\" had been a success, leading the team to announce that the launch could take place as soon as 6 March. But overnight on Friday, engineers observed an interruption in the flow of helium required for launch operations.Disruption to helium, which is used to pressurise fuel tanks and cool rocket systems, is treated as a serious technical issue, according to Nasa. Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the MoonThe test was the scientists' second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, having fixed earlier issues with filters and seals that had led to hydrogen leaks. The rocket was fuelled with around 730,000 ​gallons of propellant over several hours on Thursday, with the team stating that the simulation felt like \"a big step in us earning our right to fly\". But space missions are often fraught with setbacks, Isaaman said, highlighting that Neil Armstrong's 1966 Gemini 8 mission ended prematurely due to a technical issue, before his historic moon landing three years later. Three US astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hanse, are due to take off in the mega Moon rocket, which will allow them several hours to study the moon's surface up close. It is hoped that the mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but accepted this could be an ambitious time frame. ",

Teams were tasked with illustrating the theme of fair play and Unwin said the sculpture she designed was \"ridiculously complicated\".She said: \"It was so difficult to work it out but we did actually do it.\"At about four o'clock on the last day, I was sort of thinking: 'I don't know if it's going to work,' but it did. \"It was a bit rough around the edges, but it was snowing quite a bit, so it covered up the mistakes.\"She added: \"We came second which is just very exciting because there were some really good ones.\"Living in Devon she is unable to practice with snow but, as a stone sculptor by trade, she said carving both was a similar practice. \"Stone is obviously harder and, generally, I'm working much smaller, but it's taking stuff off to create the sculpture, so it's very much the same technique.\"More on this storyRelated internet links ",

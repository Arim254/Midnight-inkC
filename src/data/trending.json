    "body": "Asylum seekers will be banned from taking taxis for medical appointments3 hours agoNick Eardley,Political CorrespondentandSue Mitchell,Investigations reporterBBCA BBC investigation found asylum seekers in hotels were taking taxi journeys costing hundreds of poundsAsylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced.It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxis or minicabs, with one asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.In response, the government launched an urgent review into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September.Now the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used.On Friday, one driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys.He told File on Four that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away. Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton \"more than once\", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car.He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted. \"I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,\" he said.But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change.She said: \"I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances.\"I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel.\"She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts.Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport.There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence.Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said the current use of taxis was \"symptomatic of an asylum system that allows private contractors to make vast profits at the expense of the taxpayer\".He added that: \"It is more a consequence of government incompetence and poor contract management than people in the asylum system exploiting it.\"Mr Solomon called for an end to \"profiteering\" contracts and for more asylum seekers to be allowed to work \"so they can support themselves\".Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites.But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK - an increase compared to June.There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation, which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed.When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options.But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found.The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system, with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers.The government has recovered £74m since it came to power but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis.\"As Labour hammer working people with £26 billion in tax rises, they have allowed costs for illegal arrivals to spiral because Labour don't have the backbone to take the tough decisions needed. \"Namely, deporting all illegal arrivals and leaving the ECHR. Until that happens, the bills will keep mounting.\"",

    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes4 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

In August, she became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title - the second-highest ranking in women's chess, below grandmaster.  Yury KrylovBodhana became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title earlier this yearLast year, she made history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport, at the age of just nine. Bodhana says she wants to become the youngest grandmaster in history. The current recordholder is American chess player Abhimanyu Mishra, who claimed the title at the age of just 12. Blitz is a type of speed chess in which each game lasts no more than ten minutes.",

It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

If either Piastri or Verstappen does, then the battle will go to the final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend.Verstappen made up two places at the start as he followed team-mate Yuki Tsunoda past the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso, who had excelled in putting his uncompetitive car fourth on the grid, and the Japanese then let the Dutchman past.Verstappen challenged Norris for the first few laps, even feigning an overtaking attempt on the Briton at one point, but eventually began to drop back complaining of bouncing and jumping from his car.After the first three corners, the only overtaking move in the points positions was when Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli took advantage of Alonso running wide out of the final corner at the end of lap 12 to pass down the inside of Turn One at the start of the following lap.Both Tsunoda and Antonelli were given five-second penalties for exceeding track limits too many times, leaving both in the same fifth and sixth positions.Alonso took two valuable points for Aston Martin in seventh while Williams' Carlos Sainz earned the final point in eighth.Ferrari had a dire race. Charles Leclerc dropped from ninth on the grid to finish 13th, after two off-track moments, while Lewis Hamilton finished 17th after starting from the pit lane.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAleks PhillipsandYang TianMore than 600,000 people in the Kyiv region of Ukraine were without power on Saturday morning after an overnight Russian attack.Ukraine's energy ministry said more than 500,000 of these were in the capital itself, with the rest in the surrounding region. It attributed the power losses to missile and drone strikes on energy infrastructure in the city and several other regions.Around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones were launched on targets across Ukraine overnight, officials said, killing three and injuring dozens of others.Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure as the embattled nation heads into winter, despite US-led efforts to secure a peace deal.Russia's defence ministry said it had launched \"a massive strike... against Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises and the energy facilities that support their operation\".Dtek Energy, which serves properties in Kyiv, said later on Saturday that power had been restored to more than 360,000 families.As well as energy infrastructure, several residential buildings were hit in the overnight strikes, Ukrainian officials said.Loud explosions were heard across Kyiv early on Saturday morning. Emergency services were later seen attending to burning blocks of flats damaged by strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the 29 people injured in the capital city.Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 558 of the drones and 19 of the missiles.Kyiv is among several cities that have suffered regular aerial bombardment since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Many Ukrainians have also had to live through regular blackouts, as Moscow has targeted energy infrastructure in previous winters.On Sunday it is forecast to fall to 2C in Kyiv, which has average temperatures below freezing in December.Ukraine has targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and depots, in particular with long-range weaponry that can probe deep inside Russia. It says this is to curb revenue for Moscow's war effort from Russia's main export.Ukraine's security service said on Saturday that it had struck two oil tankers in the Black Sea thought to be part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" of vessels used to evade international sanctions.It published footage showing a waterborne drone barrelling towards one of the boats, followed by video showing fire and smoke billowing out of the vessel's side.The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend. US President Donald Trump is pushing for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily in favour of Russia but subsequently revised during talks with Ukrainians and their European allies in Geneva.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed the diplomatic efforts while stressing Kyiv's need to retain its sovereignty and ability to fend off any future attack.On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia would only halt its offensive if Ukraine's troops withdrew from territory claimed by Moscow.Russian forces currently control most - but not all - of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, as well as a portion of the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. US and European allies have called for the war to be frozen along the current front line.Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan.",

    "body": "9 hours agoYang TianandJames FitzGeraldWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromThe Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director has said.Joseph Edlow said the pause would be in place \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".It came hours after US President Donald Trump pledged to \"permanently pause migration\" from all \"third world countries\".The flurry of immigration decisions come in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, which left one soldier dead and another in a critical condition, and which officials have accused an Afghan national for perpetrating.While the first of these specifically targeted Afghans seeking to enter the US, other decisions have been far more wide-reaching.The USCIS - a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.But few details are known about Friday's directive.Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.The US president's recent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants, cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US territory.Following Wednesday's fatal attack, the Trump administration temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests from Afghans pending a review.Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries, without mentioning Wednesday's attack.The agency referred to a June proclamation that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela. Details on what re-examination would look like were not provided.Trump then pledged to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to non-citizens\" on Thursday. 'Third-world countries'Trump blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.\"Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,\" he said.\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"The phrase \"third world\" is one previously used to describe poorer, developing nations. Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan. During Trump's first term, he enacted a travel ban targeting multiple Muslim-majority countries.The UN has urged the US to observe international agreements on asylum seekers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump's reaction to the shooting amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.He told the BBC World Service's Newsday before Trump's latest remarks that the attacker's motive were unclear, and that radicalisation and mental illness could affect anyone. \"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality.\"Suspect in DC shooting is AfghanOfficials said the shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021.He travelled under a programme that offered special protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in Afghanistan before their chaotic withdrawal and the return to power of the Taliban. Mr Lakanwal had been a member of a \"Zero Unit\" - an Afghan intelligence and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA - a former Afghan defence and security forces member told CBS.The US considered Zero Units to be among the most respected domestic forces in Afghanistan.The CIA's current director has confirmed that he previously worked with the US intelligence agency.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanHe would have been vetted by the US both when he started working with the CIA and when he travelled to the US, a senior US official told CNN.A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.Mr Lakanwal was reportedly granted asylum after Trump returned to office, having applied in 2024.But his request for a green card - which shows a person has permanent residence in the US - is pending, an official told CBS.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up?5 hours agoJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent, KyivReutersAndriy Yermak was one of Ukraine's most powerful figuresAndriy Yermak was a constant, looming presence in Ukraine's government - a seemingly immovable figure on the political stage.Despite his towering frame, you might not always have spotted him. Yet, wherever President Volodymyr Zelensky was, Yermak was often not far away.As his chief of staff, Yermak wielded enormous power at the top of government and was even trusted to negotiate on Ukraine's behalf at peace talks with the US.But as his influence grew, so did public resentment of the power this unelected official held. His political career came to an abrupt end on Friday, hours after anti-corruption investigators raided his home in Kyiv.Yermak and Zelensky first met in 2011 when the former was an intellectual property lawyer and the latter a TV producer.After working together during the successful presidential campaign of 2019, Yermak became Zelensky's chief of staff. He stood next to the president as he gave his now famous \"we are still here\" speech as the Russians descended on Kyiv at the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.As Zelensky concentrated his power over time, Yermak was widely viewed as the second most powerful person in Ukraine. He reportedly helped shape foreign policy, ousted political rivals and even made battlefield decisions.ReutersYermak (right) was always at the centre of the action in Ukraine's governmentUkrainian politics is shaped by big characters, and Zelensky's administration had not one, but two of them.Despite the favourable conditions Yermak enjoyed within the sprawling Presidential Office, the same couldn't be said outside its steep walls.His popularity was nosediving.A widening scandalZelensky had successfully grappled with corruption scandals in the past, but in July a chain of events began that has shaken the current government to its core, weakening him politically and costing him his right-hand man.That month, the president convinced parliament to formally remove the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption bodies and bring them under direct government control.At the time, Zelensky said it was to limit Russian interference. But the public - as well as the European Union - disagreed, and he was forced to U-turn after mass demonstrations.Getty ImagesThe decision to strip anti-corruption bodies of their independence sparked mass protests, which in turn forced a government U-turnBy the autumn, those same agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), released the findings of a lengthy investigation that implicated members of Zelensky's inner circles.Senior figures - including two ministers, a former deputy prime minister and a one-time business partner of Zelensky's - were accused of syphoning $100m (£75m) from public projects in the energy sector.At a time when Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid with missiles and drones ahead of a fourth winter of war - forcing the entire country to endure daily power cuts - public anger at these corruption allegations has soared. Just on Friday night alone, Kyiv endured a nearly 11-hour-long Russian air raid, which left more than half a million people without power.\"We're going through one of the most difficult times in our history,\" Iryna, a Kyiv resident, told the BBC this week. \"Unfortunately, lots of families will not see their loved ones, their men, brothers or husbands, because of the war.\"Despite not being named as a suspect and denying any involvement in the scheme, Andriy Yermak couldn't distance himself. There was a suspicion he may have known something. Local media reported on Saturday that investigators were combing through several laptops and mobile phones they had seized from his flat during their search.Yermak led last week's talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva, apparently securing some concessions for his country in a US-drafted peace proposal which many feared heavily favoured Russia.Getty ImagesMr Yermak was a key figure in negotiations with the USAt a time when Ukraine is fighting and negotiating for its very survival, his resignation is hugely destabilising.Talks will continue next week. Ukraine's presidential office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov was the head of a delegation heading to the US.What is not known is whether this will be a timely reboot for Kyiv, or a costly lack of continuity.It is also not known how Yermak is taking his sudden departure from government. The New York Post reported on Saturday that he had texted their paper and vowed to go to the front line. He also declared his innocence. \"I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals,\" he reportedly said. \"I am an honest and decent person.\"But there is a feeling that Yermak's departure is a sign of positive change.\"Let's call it what it is: good news,\" says Olga Rudenko, editor of the Kyiv Independent.\"Think about it: a young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country - and to do so during the war.\"People rooting for Ukraine around the world aren't rooting for a place on the map, but for a place living by certain values - and fighting for them. Today we see these values in action.\"This shows why Ukraine is exactly the country worth supporting.\"Additional reporting by Toby Luckhurst",

    "body": "Adolescence lasts into 30s - new study shows four pivotal ages for your brain4 days agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentMonty Rakusen/GettyThe brain goes through five distinct phases in life, with key turning points at ages nine, 32, 66 and 83, scientists have revealed.Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells.Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we \"peak\".They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life.The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience – but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death.Instead, these are the five brain phases:Childhood - from birth to age nineAdolescence - from nine to 32Adulthood - from 32 to 66Early ageing - from 66 to 83Late ageing - from 83 onwards\"The brain rewires across the lifespan. It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring,\" the lead author of the research, Dr Alexa Mousley, told the BBC.Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.The five brain phasesChildhood - The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.Adolescence - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. \"It's a huge shift,\" said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was \"very interesting\" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.Adulthood - Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.Dr Mousely said this \"aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality\" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.Early ageing - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.Late ageing - Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different \"ages align with a lot of important milestones\" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.'A very cool study'The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge and part of the team responsible for the research, said: \"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours.\"The director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Prof Tara Spires-Jones, who did not work on the research paper, said: \"This is a very cool study highlighting how much our brains change over our lifetimes.\"She said the results \"fit well\" with our understanding of brain ageing, but cautioned \"not everyone will experience these network changes at exactly the same ages\".",

    "body": "1 day agoYasmin RufoGeorgia BarringtonDaisy (right) gave birth to Georgia's baby, Ottilie, in October Georgia Barrington has just become a new mother - but she isn't the one who gave birth to her daughter. Instead, that moment belonged to her best friend, Daisy Hope, who carried the baby for her after a promise made when they were teenagers.The women have been inseparable their whole lives. They call themselves \"soul sisters\" and have grown up together as their fathers are best friends. Their childhood closeness would later become the foundation for a life-changing act of generosity. At 15, Georgia was told something no young girl expects to hear - she had been born without a womb and would never carry a child.The diagnosis, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, affects around one in 5,000 women and for Georgia, it felt like her future had been rewritten in a single moment.\"It was devastating, my whole world had fallen apart,\" she recalls. \"I'd always grown up thinking I would be a mum and that was ripped out from under me and everything I ever dreamed of had gone.\"Back then, Daisy wasn't particularly maternal and she remembers the diagnosis vividly and how \"unfair\" it felt that her friend who had always wanted to have a child couldn't.\"I wanted her to feel ok and to give her some hope that it wasn't the end of the world so I said that I would carry a baby for her one day,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett.\"I don't think I understood what I was saying then but I always knew this was something I was going to do for Georgia.\"Georgia BarringtonGeorgia and Daisy (right) have been best friends since childhood and grew up together More than a decade later, Daisy followed through on that promise and in 2023 the two women began the IVF process.Georgia had trained as a midwife, immersing herself in the world she feared she could never be part of. \"I was asked once whether this was the right career for me,\" she says. \"But actually, it helped me heal and deep down I knew I'd have a child one way or another.\" Years later, Daisy had her first child – with Georgia as her midwife - and becoming a mum herself strengthened her conviction to fulfil her promise.\"The love I felt for my child was amazing and I thought everyone should be able to have that feeling,\" she says. She admits she was a \"bit naïve\" at the beginning as she had a straightforward pregnancy with her daughter and so \"assumed everything would go smoothly again\".'Hope dropped away'She became pregnant with the first embryo and everything seemed to be progressing normally and both women allowed themselves to believe the future they'd imagined was finally happening. But a scan at seven weeks revealed an empty womb.Georgia remembers the moment the nurse said she couldn't see anything on the scan.\"I had this sinking feeling, and all hope just dropped away,\" she says.A week later it was confirmed that the embryo hadn't become a baby.\"I thought it was all my fault,\" admits Daisy who found the grief overwhelming, feeling she had let her friend down, while Georgia struggled with the realisation that even their most promising attempt hadn't succeeded.Still, they tried again and on the second time, something felt different as Daisy says: \"When I found out I was pregnant again, I thought the world cannot be this cruel twice.\"Georgia BarringtonDaisy (right) says she always knew she was going to carry Georgia's baby Six weeks in, the pair sat in a hospital room holding their breath as a tiny heartbeat appeared on the screen, but later that day, Daisy began to bleed heavily.\"I thought it was happening all over again and I was terrified,\" she says.She bled for six hours and was convinced she had miscarried but when doctors checked, the heartbeat was still there and the pregnancy continued to full term.Daisy went into labour slightly earlier than expected and a few months ago gave birth to a baby girl.Georgia was so overwhelmed in the moment she \"forgot to check the sex of the baby\".\"As soon as I saw the baby's head, I just lost it and we were all crying.\"She says she still struggles to believe she really has a child and wishes she could \"take this moment and hand it to my 15-year-old self, sitting in that GP surgery\".As Georgia talks of how \"lucky and grateful\" she feels, Daisy says she always knew she would help her best friend out however she could. \"We have this bond that no one will ever have with their friends because we've been through something so personal.\"All episodes of Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett are available on BBC Sounds.

    "body": "Manchester to London train to run without passengers2 hours agoAngela FergusonNorth WestGetty ImagesAvanti says the decision by the Office of Rail and Road is \"disappointing\"A train service taking commuters from Manchester to London is to run empty for around five months following a decision by the rail regulator.A decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), means the 07:00 GMT service operated by Avanti West Coast from Manchester Piccadilly to London will still run but will only be used to carry staff from mid-December.An Avanti West Coast spokesperson said they were \"disappointed\" with the decision, which would \"clearly impact those customers who already use these services\".An ORR spokesperson said the decision was made on \"robust evidence\" from Network Rail to guard against possible service disruption on the West Coast Main Line.Network Rail declined to comment.The fast service, which gets to London in under two hours, will still set off from Manchester Piccadilly at 07:00 on four weekdays, but will not be available to commuters.It will, instead, ferry Avanti staff from Manchester to London when the new timetable launches on 15 December.The decision means the service could run for more than 100 journeys without paying passengers on board.An Avanti West Coast spokesperson said they were disappointed with the ORR's decision not to grant access rights from December for four weekday services that they currently operated, including the 07:00 fast service from Manchester to London.The ORR also required a Sunday service which currently runs from Holyhead to London to terminate at Crewe, they added. \"This will clearly impact those customers who already use these services,\" they said.\"However, we will still be delivering even more services across our network from the start of the December timetable, including further additional trains on our Liverpool route.\" The spokesperson confirmed that the services being removed were:07:00 GMT: Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston (Monday to Friday)12:52 GMT: Blackpool North – London Euston (Monday to Friday)09:39 GMT: London Euston – Blackpool North (Monday to Friday)19:32 GMT: Chester – London Euston (Monday to Friday)17:53 GMT: Holyhead – London Euston terminates at Crewe (Sunday)Getty ImagesAn ORR spokesperson said: \"Our decision on the Manchester-London service was based on robust evidence provided by Network Rail that adding services within 'firebreak' paths on the West Coast Main Line would have a detrimental impact on performance. \"We identified that this service would run in one of those paths. If Avanti operates the service as empty coaching stock (ECS), ECS can be run more flexibly (delayed or re-routed) than a booked passenger service. \"This can assist with performance management and service recovery during disruption.\"The ORR said Avanti was previously given the right to run this service from May 2025 for the duration of one timetable period only. This was on the basis that First Lumo's Stirling services were not operating at the time but the First Lumo services are expected to begin operating during the December 2025 timetable period. The ORR added that under the new timetable, new open access train services, run by First Lumo to Stirling in Scotland, were due to start.More like this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Text scammers make tens of thousands a month - and spend it on designer shoes and bags 11 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandGuy LambertBBCDet Ch Insp Curtis says as many as 10,000 pieces of evidence have been seized\"They don't keep money, they spend it here and now.\"Det Ch Insp Paul Curtis is showing us around an evidence room piled high with designer shoes and handbags. Thousands of items are neatly stacked in plastic containers on wooden shelves.The items here have been seized from financial fraudsters, some of whom send scam texts - known as smishing - to victims. \"They like to live a lavish lifestyle,\" says Curtis. \"We have got somewhere between 8,500 and 10,000 items of evidence in this one room,\" he says, something that is \"the result of house searches and raids\" carried out by officers.The smell of fresh leather goods pervades the air. Brightly coloured Gucci stilettos catch the eye from a distance; it's a treasure trove of top-label kit worth tens of thousands of pounds.These purchases are an indication of how much cash they're making from their crimes and what they're spending it on.The term \"smishing\" is a combination of \"SMS\", or \"short message service\" - the technology behind text messages - and \"phishing\". Fraudsters send fake text messages - apparently from a bank or other trusted company - to trick people into disclosing personal information such as passwords and Pin numbers. The intention is to defraud them out of their money.Curtis is part of the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit - a team made up of officers from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police service.Although they're London police forces, the unit has a national remit, and is sponsored by the banking industry. It focuses on combating financial fraud.\"In a recent smishing case of ours, the defendant was sentenced on the basis of sending 15,000 messages in a five day period. That equated to making a hundred thousand pounds a month,\" he says.The senior officer was talking about Ruichen Xiong, a student from China who was convicted of the crime after driving around London in March of this year, sending messages to tens of thousands of potential victims.Xiong was sentenced to 58 weeks in prison at Inner London Crown Court in June after pleading guilty to fraud by representation.According to Ofcom, half of UK mobile users said they received a suspicious message between November 2024 and February 2025 via text or iMessage.'I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated'Gideon Rabinowitz, 64, lives in Newbury, Berkshire, and is a recent victim of smishing.Just two months ago, the former IT manager said he was cheated out of more than a thousand pounds after receiving a fraudulent text message.\"I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated,\" he says.Gideon Rabinowitz says he received a text out of the blue\"It really shook me. For a number of days after it really left me quite shaken. I felt very vulnerable and I don't know who to trust now.\"Mr Rabinowitz was led to believe he was being contacted by his bank who were reporting a suspicious payment on his account.In reality, he was being messaged by a scammer.\"It started with a text out of the blue asking if I recognised a transaction - yes or no. Two and half hours later I was out of pocket by £1400.\"He adds: \"In part it was about the money and it was also this feeling of being defrauded, of being looked up, because these people knew who I was. They knew where I live\".Scam text messages often pretend to be from large companies such as utility companies, banks or supermarkets. They usually include a link. Once the person clicks on it, they can be sent to a fraudulent website and asked for personal and financial information. The information can then be used to convince them to transfer money from their account.Smishing is primarily done through two devices; a Sim farm which holds multiple Sim cards, allowing criminals to bombard people with thousands of scam texts.The second is what's called an SMS Blaster. It tricks mobiles nearby into connecting with it, and then sends large numbers of fraudulent texts in a matter of seconds.Sim farms hold multiple cards at once for maximum efficiencyThe government says \"smishing scams have a devastating impact on their victims\".\"Our Telecoms Charter sets out clear action to secure SMS and reduce fraud across the telecoms sector\".\"We are also banning Sim farms. Banning these devices used to send thousands of scam texts will close down a key tool for criminals and safeguard consumers,\" it says.The ban is expected to come into effect late next year. It will make the possession or supply of Sim farms, without a specified reason, illegal.'Easy to do, hard to trace'One cyber expert said smishing was a difficult crime to solve and that there needs to be more education around fraudulent text messages.\"Smishing in and of itself is very hard to police because a lot of it comes from abroad and, even when it's done from within the UK it's very easy to do and hard to trace, \" says Ciaran Martin, the former Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre.\"So while the police can sometimes take down big operations, we shouldn't look to the police as the strategic answer for this. \"The strategic answer is for people to understand that serious businesses don't ask you for money by text, and for businesses to find better ways of interacting with customers and verifying that interaction\".The advice from police is simple: do not click on the links in any unsolicited messages you receive. If you believe you're a victim of fraud, report to Action Fraud, report to your bank, and forward the message to 7726 so the mobile networks can investigate further.Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell.

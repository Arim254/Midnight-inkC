This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.",

    "body": "3 days agoJasmine SandharBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesIt will be the first time the US singer will lead a major studio movieSabrina Carpenter looks set to swap her signature Espresso for tea - with the Mad Hatter. The US pop star is going back to her acting roots with plans to star in and produce a musical movie inspired by Alice in Wonderland, BBC Newsbeat understands. The unnamed project is being made for Universal Pictures and will be written and directed by US filmmaker Lorene Scafaria.It's not clear who Carpenter will play in the adaptation or when it will go into production.A 'Busy Woman'If it goes ahead, it will be Carpenter's first time leading a major studio film.The 26-year-old singer approached Universal last year with ideas for it, according to US media outlets. As the wonderland became more of a reality, Scafaria reportedly decided to join the madness.Writer and director Scafaria is best known for her work on Hustlers, a 2019 film fronted by Jennifer Lopez about a crew of strippers in New York City. Carpenter has recently been nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the coveted album of the year prize for her seventh album, Man's Best Friend. She is currently on the last leg of her Short n' Sweet Tour, which included two headline shows at London's BST Festival this summer. The upcoming film will not be the first time she's gone down the rabbit hole of acting. Getty ImagesCarpenter began her acting career on Disney Channel, playing Maya Hart in the TV series Girl Meets WorldCarpenter started out as a child actor on Disney Channel playing a recurring role as Maya Hart on the comedy series Girl Meets World.Since then, she's appeared in Netflix films Work It and Tall Girl, as well as 20th Century Fox's The Hate U Give.More recently, she's been announced as a \"guest star\" in a one-off Muppet Show special for Disney+, which will premiere in 2026.Previous Alice in Wonderland versions include the 1951 animated movie by Disney and Tim Burton's 2010 take with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. The story comes from Victorian author Lewis Carroll, who first published Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a children's novel in 1865.It tells the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands in a fantasy world of talking animals and creatures.

    "body": "Chance of snow in UK this week after Storm Claudia clearsImage source, EPAByDarren BettLead Weather PresenterUpdated 2 hours agoThere's a battle taking place at the moment across the UK between mild air and cold air. On the front line is the band of rain which brought flooding and travel disruption on Friday.Once this rain clears away this weekend the cold air will sweep the field and bring a regime change with snow for some of us next week.When is it going to get cold?Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, Maximum temperatures by Monday will be significantly lowerFor many places it has been very mild since the start of the month. On Thursday the temperature reached 18.7 Celsius (65.6 F) in Surrey. But already the air was much colder in Scotland. Hence the battle.On Saturday the rain brought by Storm Claudia will die out and on Sunday the colder air starts to arrive from the north. By Monday that cold air will have spread to the whole of the country.Maximum daytime temperatures on Monday are expected drop by as much as 8 degrees Celsius in England and Wales compared with Thursday. There will also be a more widespread risk of frost.The cold weather is likely to continue throughout next week before temperatures start to recover next weekend and mild Atlantic air returns.The UK Health Security Agency, in partnership with the Met Office, has issued yellow cold health alerts, external for central and northern parts of England between 8am on Monday 17 November to 8am Friday 21 November. It is important to note that warnings are only issued for England.Why such a dramatic change?Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, A change in wind direction will plunge colder air southwardsThe significant drop in temperature is due to a change in wind direction.Since the start of this month there has generally been a southerly wind bringing a very mild, but cloudy, tropical maritime airmass all the way from the Canary Islands.This pattern will change, and from being on the warmer side of the jet stream the UK will be on the colder side of it.By Monday the colder air in the north will have been swept southwards on a northerly wind bringing down an arctic maritime airmass - and that means the chance of snow.Where is it likely to snow?Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, Areas of the UK in the firing line of the northerly wind are more likely to have snowIt is still a few days away and the details for next week are likely to change. But at the moment it looks as if there could be wintry showers - a mixture of rain, sleet and snow - mainly over northern Scotland, Northern Ireland, the North Yorkshire Moors, west Wales and the moors of south-west England.Essentially, areas exposed to the cold northerly wind.An Atlantic weather system coming into the cold air on Tuesday could bring some snow inland over Scotland and northern England. This could briefly spread to the Midlands and south-east England on Wednesday morning. It's too early to say though if and where the snow will settle.It is unlikely to be as bad as the snowy and icy spell this time last year which closed hundreds of schools and gave 12cm of snow in Nottingham.Over recent decades the Met Office have observed a decrease in the frequency, duration, and intensity of cold spells, clearly linked to climate change. According to the latest State of the Climate Report, external, air and ground frosts have reduced by around a quarter since the 1980s.Image source, BBCWeatherWatcher /JoJoImage caption, Snow in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire on 18 November last year",

    "body": "10 hours agoGetty ImagesThe two-child limit means many low-income families do not receive further benefits when they have a third or subsequent child.It has been the subject of intense political debate and speculation, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves hinting at changes in the Budget.So how does the system work and what might happen?What is the two-child cap and how many people does it affect?The policy, introduced by Conservative chancellor George Osborne, means parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children.It applies to third or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.A total of 1.6 million children are living in larger families who cannot claim these means-tested benefits as a result. If the cap had not been introduced, affected families could have received an average of £4,400 in benefit entitlements a year, roughly a tenth of their total disposable income, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The think tank estimates the policy will ultimately save the Treasury about £3.6bn a year.So it has nothing to do with child benefit?Correct. There is often a misconception that the two-child limit affects the payment of child benefit, because it is called the two-child benefit cap.So, take a breath between \"two-child\" and \"benefit\".This policy is specifically directed at universal credit and tax credits, not child benefit. How does the cap work?If you receive universal credit or tax credits then, generally, you won't be paid any additional benefit if you have or had a third or subsequent child born after 6 April 2017.If you have, for example, four children born before that date, then you will still receive the additional payments. That relates to children aged under 16, or young people aged under 20 who are in full-time education or training.There are other exceptions.If a parent, or parents, have one child, and the next are twins or triplets, then a claim can be made for all these children.Claims can also be made if children are born after rape, or from a coercive relationship. Payments can also go to children who are adopted, in your care rather than local authority care, or are a child of your child.Why have some criticised the cap?More than 100 charities have written to the chancellor to call for the two-child limit to be scrapped.A host of backbench Labour MPs want the chancellor to scrap it, arguing that it would bring hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.However, in doing so, a gap would be created in savings for the Treasury. The money would probably need to be found in cuts elsewhere, through tax rises, or from increases in government borrowing.The Conservatives support the cap, saying it makes the system fairer, and means parents on benefits face the same financial choices as parents who fund themselves solely through work.What could change in the Budget?The chancellor hinted at changes when she told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were \"penalised\" through \"no fault of their own\".She has options beyond simply scrapping the policy entirely.The benefit could be given to all families irrespective of the number of children, but at a lower level.The chancellor could also offer partial payments, potentially getting smaller for each additional child to reflect that these children might use the same buggy as their siblings or hand-me-down clothes.She could also cap the benefit payments at a higher number of children.",

    "body": "Pakistan's army has always been influential - now its chief has new powers13 hours agoCaroline DaviesPakistan correspondent, IslamabadEPAField Marshal Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee the navy and air forcePakistan's parliament has voted to give army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir new powers and lifetime immunity from arrest and prosecution, a move that critics say paves the way towards autocracy.The 27th constitutional amendment, which was signed into law on Thursday, will also make significant changes to the way the country's top courts operate.Those defending the changes say they provide clarity and administrative structure to the armed forces, while helping to ease a backlog in the courts. Pakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politics - sometimes seizing power in coups, and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes.Throughout its history, Pakistan has oscillated from more civilian autonomy to overt control under military leaders like General Pervez Musharraf and General Zia-ul-Haq. Analysts refer to the balance between civilian and military as hybrid rule.Some see the amendment as a sign that the balance is shifting in the military's favour.\"For me, this amendment is the latest indication, perhaps the strongest yet, that Pakistan is now experiencing not a hybrid system, but a post-hybrid system,\" says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington. \"We're essentially looking at a situation where the civil-military imbalance is about as imbalanced as it could possibly be.\"The latest amendment means that Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee Pakistan's navy and air force.His field marshal title and uniform are for life and he will be given \"responsibilities and duties\" even after retirement determined by the president with the advice of the prime minister. The expectation is that this will give him a prominent role in public life for as long as he is alive.Supporters of the bill have argued it clarifies Pakistan's military command structure.Pakistan's government-operated news agency, the Associated Press of Pakistan, cited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the changes were part of a broader reform agenda to ensure Pakistan's defence keeps pace with modern warfare requirements.But others see it as ceding power to the military.\"There is no balance between the military and the civilians,\" says Munizae Jahangir, journalist and co-chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\"They have tilted again that power dynamic towards the military and empowered the military at a time when the military needed to be reined in.\"Getty ImagesPakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politicsNo 'independent space to operate'The second controversial area of change are the courts and judiciary.Under the amendment a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) will be created which will determine constitutional questions. The FCC's first chief justice and the judges that serve in it will be appointed by the president. \"It forever changes the shape and the nature of the right to a fair trial,\" says Ms Jahangir.\"The influence of the executive has increased not just in appointing judges but also constitutional benches. When the state is dictating the constitution of those benches then what hope do I have as a litigant of getting a fair trial?\"Arifa Noor, journalist and commentator, says: \"The judiciary is now quite subservient to the executive.\"The general consensus seems to be that the judiciary is now going to not really have any independent space to operate for the moment.\"Before this amendment was passed, the Supreme Court would hear and decide on constitutional cases. Some said this created a backlog of criminal and civil cases waiting to be heard as judges had to listen to constitutional arguments as well,  arguing that separating the two has helped smooth the court process.That has some traction with some lawyers, although Salahuddin Ahmed, a Karachi-based lawyer in the Supreme Court, sees that argument as disingenuous. He points out that the majority of cases pending in Pakistan are not in the Supreme Court.\"Statistically, if you were genuinely worried about making litigation quicker, you would focus on reforms for those cases.\"In the hours after the amendment was signed into law, two Supreme Court justices handed in their resignations.\"The constitution that I swore an oath to uphold and defend is no more,\" said Justice Athar Minallah in his resignation letter.Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that the judiciary had been brought under the control of the government and that the 27th amendment had \"torn the Supreme Court to pieces\".Khawaja Asif, the defence minister, said of the resignations \"their conscience has awakened because their monopoly on the Supreme Court has been curbed and Parliament has tried to prove the supremacy of the Constitution\".Judges can also now be transferred to different courts without their consent. If they don't agree to the transfer, judges can appeal to the judicial commission and if their reasons for not moving are found invalid the judge would have to retire. Those in favour argue that this will ensure that courts in all areas of the country can be staffed, but some are worried it will be used as a threat.\"To pick a judge up from the province where he's been serving and take him to a different high court is something that will place them under further pressure to toe the government's line,\" says Mr Ahmed. He worries that the change will upset the balance in Pakistan.\"[Our judiciary] has collaborated with dictators in the past, but they've also sometimes nudged the executive. I think if you completely rob people of that hope, then that sends them into other, much uglier directions.\"Mr Kugelman agrees: \"Bottled-up grievances don't bode well for social stability.\"\"It does indicate a slide towards authoritarianism,\" says Ms Noor, adding that she sees the latest amendment as building on the 26th amendment, made last year, which gave lawmakers the power to pick Pakistan's top judge. There is already speculation of a 28th. \"It indicates that the balance of power is tilted in favour, heavily tilted in favour, of the establishment.\"",

    "body": "BBC now faces tough legal battle with world's most powerful man. What happens next?2 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorAnyone who thought the BBC's apology to Donald Trump was going to stop his threat of a lawsuit was, quite frankly, deluded.The BBC chairman Samir Shah perhaps summed it up in the interview he gave me the day after the director general and the CEO of News resigned. He called the president \"a litigious fellow\".That's an understatement, evident in the number of legal cases Trump has taken out against various US media companies.The president, based on his GB News interview, is clearly hurt by what he sees as an \"egregious\" edit, and he has now apparently upped the amount he says he will sue the corporation for. While on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump told reporters the figure would be \"anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn\".To put this in context, the BBC's annual income from the licence fee was £3.8 billion last year.On Friday, Trump said: \"They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" He wants to know why Panorama edited two clips of his speech together to give a \"totally different meaning\".He doesn't accept the BBC's response that what happened was unintentional.This is a very serious moment in the history of the BBC. It stands or falls by being viewed as impartial - a source to trust in a world where trust in institutions is falling.Instead, the corporation is being accused of the opposite - and faces an expensive and very public battle with the most powerful man in the world.So where does it go from here?Ever since the president first threatened legal action, it was clear that the corporation did not intend to offer him compensation. It believes it has a case that, whatever error was made, no harm was caused to Trump by the Panorama programme. He was elected President soon after it went out and anyway, says the BBC, the programme wasn't broadcast on any US channels, so how could it have harmed him?I think there was a certain consensus, inside and outside the corporation, that the notion of using licence fee payers' money to settle with Trump was a non-starter.As one former senior BBC executive put it to me, after the BBC had rejected offering compensation, \"they've made the right call\". But this person also said, if the president did decide to sue, the BBC would have to \"baton down - and get the best lawyers in Florida\".The reason to settle would have been to bring down costs in the long run.Now it looks as if the BBC will be involved in a protracted, costly court battle at a time when it should be 100% focussed on the discussions over the renewal of its charter, which are ramping up.The people at the top of the BBC should be fully concentrating on what is, in normal times, a fundamental moment for the corporation - when what it's for, its scope, how it will be funded, the details of its very existence are all hammered out between government and BBC in time for a new charter at the start of 2028.It's already losing the man who should have led that - Tim Davie, the Director General. Now top BBC brains will be diverted, to game out its next moves in what could be a very damaging, even existential fight with Donald Trump. The legal fees alone could get very expensive.This might all have been avoided if the BBC had been open about the error much earlier and corrected it. Instead, it faces a long road. But there may be routes off it. Might the BBC ask the UK government to step in through back channels? Would a call from Prime Minister Keir Starmer persuade Trump to change his mind? Would Starmer even want to get involved and expend his own political capital with the US president?One positive for the BBC this week was the robust nature in which the culture secretary Lisa Nandy defended the corporation. She talked about the widespread trust in BBC News and described the corporation as \"a light on the hill for people in times of darkness\" which brings the country together, whether through Celebrity Traitors or its VE Day coverage.Donald Trump, on the other hand, has called the BBC \"worse than fake news\". He claims the corporation and its journalists are corrupt.The fight is well and truly on.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsNine people have been killed and 32 injured after a stockpile of confiscated explosives accidentally blew up at a police station in Indian-administered Kashmir, police said.It comes just days after a car blast killed several people in Delhi, in what the government has called a \"terror incident\". The explosion happened on Friday evening at Nowgam police station, and the explosives were seized from Faridabad in the northern state of Haryana earlier in the week. The region's director general of police, Nalin Prabhat, said the explosives were being sent for forensic examination - but due to a \"very unfortunate\" mishap during handling they detonated at around 23:20 local time (17:50 GMT).Police said in a statement that it was an accidental detonation, not a terrorist attack. \"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" the police chief told journalists.The police station suffered severe damage in the explosion and adjacent buildings were also affected, he said.Multiple vehicles were \"engulfed in flames and reduced to charred husks, with debris scattered across the site\", according to a police statement. \"The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station,\" a source told Reuters news agency. Most of the victims were police officers, along with forensic personnel, two crime scene photographers, and a tailor who was with the team. Manoj Sinha, the region's Lieutenant Governor appointed by the Indian government, expressed his condolences and said he had ordered an investigation. \"I have ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion. Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam police station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,\" he wrote on social media.",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 3 days agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAnnabel Rackham and Emaan WarraichWatch all the best moments from Children in Need 2025The 2025 Children in Need appeal has raised more than £45m to help children and young people across the UK - with the total likely to rise even further. Hosts Paddy McGuinness, Mel Giedroyc, Lenny Rush, Rochelle Humes, Vernon Kay and Big Zuu fronted the annual fundraising show on BBC One on Friday night, live from Salford. There were sketches involving stars from Gladiators and The Apprentice, as well as a performance from some of the Strictly Come Dancing professionals.Other acts included Lewis Capaldi, McFly's Tom Fletcher and his son Buzz, and Eurovision contestants Remember Monday.The total announced at the end of the three-hour show was £45,507,536 - more than £9.5m of which was raised by Sara Cox for her 135-mile challenge.The Radio 2 DJ took part in five marathons in five days - running, jogging and walking through northern England, ending - aptly - in the town of Pudsey. Speaking to fellow Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills at the finish line on Friday afternoon, Cox said: \"It's just been the maddest, most painful, wonderful thing I've ever, ever done.\"\"I've never had shapely calves in my life,\" she joked, \"But I have now because they are so swollen, it looks like I've been hit with a bat.\"She said during the appeal show: \"It was like a rollercoaster... literally my mood was changing every three, four, seconds - it was a lot.\"Cox told the hosts she was \"absolutely exhausted\" but that it had been \"the most amazing, painful and wonderful few days of my life\". Moment Sara Cox crosses finish line after 135-mile charity runDuring The Apprentice skit, the script was flipped on Lord Sugar as he found himself on the receiving end of an intense boardroom grilling.The entrepreneur explained that he \"owed a favour to Pudsey\" and that was why he allowed eight children to ask questions like: \"Why is your name Lord Sugar when you are so salty all the time?\"\"Well Sugar is my name and that's it, what can I say?\" he replied.Lord Sugar with the mini Apprentices that grilled himPudsey Bear - the yellow bear who acts as a Children in Need mascot - and actor Rush, 16, could be seen embarking on new BBC roles as \"TV big cheeses\" in another sketch.It showed a children's takeover that aimed to put children at the heart of all BBC programming.Rush, who wore a BBC lanyard and suit, said: \"You're always going to face resistance. But remember, who runs the world? I do. Well, kids do.\"In another clip, Richard Madeley threatened to sack Rush, saying: \"We both know what's going to happen if things don't improve, don't we? Lenny is going to be fired.\"Pudsey Bear and actor Lenny Rush became the new BBC bossesFriday night's show reimagined Gladiators - with the team of elite athletes replaced by children.The so-called \"mini Gladiators\" went head-to-head with contestants in a range of tasks, but there was one small snag - they were simply too tiny to take on many of the challenges properly.The live programme also saw Giedroyc and Big Zuu led in a live workout by fitness expert Joe Wicks, which also featured some of Strictly's professional dancers. Earlier in the week Big Zuu collaborated with Pudsey Bear and a group of children from a theatre project, funded by Children in Need, to present his first CBeebies Bedtime Story.He read Basil Dreams Big by Lu Fraser and Sarah Warburton, a story about resilience, bravery, and believing in yourself. It was broadcast on Thursday night and is available to stream on BBC iPlayer.Pudsey has also taken part in a special edition of Bargain HuntThe rapper and chef said the charities that resonate most with him are \"ones that take care of carers, and also take care of parents\".  \"I know how crucial it is for young people to have a trusted adult that they can talk to who believes in them and the power this can have in helping unlock their potential,\" he said. Rush, who was hosting for his third year, added that his favourite thing about presenting, along with meeting \"so many amazing, inspiring people\" was \"having the opportunity to hear their stories\". Newscast, the BBC's daily news podcast, also got in on the action, with presenter Adam Fleming taking on a 25-hour podcasting mission between Thursday and Friday.He welcomed a host of BBC radio presenters and podcasters, including the regular Newcast team, the CBeebies Radio and 5 Live Daily podcast teams.Children in Need is the BBC's charity for disadvantaged children and young people, and has raised more than £1bn for charities and projects since its first major appeal in 1980.",

    "body": "17 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentBBCOn Valentine's Day, there's the temptation to believe that somewhere out there is \"The One\": a soulmate, a perfect match, the person you were meant to be with.Across history, humans have always been drawn to the idea that love isn't random. In ancient Greece, Plato imagined that we were once whole beings with four arms, four legs and two faces, so radiant that Zeus split us in two; ever since, each half has roamed the earth searching for its missing other, a myth that gives the modern soulmate its poetic pedigree and the promise that somewhere, someone will finally make us feel complete.In the Middle Ages, troubadours and Arthurian tales recast that longing as \"courtly love\", a fierce, often forbidden devotion like Lancelot's for Guinevere, in which a knight proved his worth through self-sacrifice for a beloved he might never openly declare.Getty ImagesPlato (left) imagined humans were once whole,  with four arms, four legs and two faces, before Zeus (right) split them, leaving each half searching for its otherBy the Renaissance, writers such as Shakespeare were talking of \"star-crossed lovers\", couples bound together by an overwhelming connection yet pulled apart by family, fortune or fate, as if the universe itself both wrote their love story and barred them from a happy ending.In more recent times, Hollywood and romance novels have sold us fairy tale love stories.But what does the latest science say about soulmates? Is there a particular special someone out there for us?How we fall for 'The One'Viren Swami, Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), in Cambridge, has traced our contemporary European understanding of romantic love back to medieval Europe and those stories of Camelot, Lancelot, Guinevere and the chivalry of the knights of the round table that swept across the continent.\"These stories first pushed the idea that you should choose one other individual as your companion and that companion is for life,\" he says.\"Before that, in much of Europe, you could love as many people as you like, and love was fluid, and it was often not about sex.\"Over time, as people are uprooted from their agricultural communities as industrialisation tears apart people's familiar attachments, individuals become \"alienated\", he says. \"They start looking for one other individual to save them, to save them from the wretchedness of their lives.\"Getty ImagesViren Swami believes today's ideas about romantic love can be traced back to medieval European stories like Lancelot and GuinevereToday's dating apps turn that story into an algorithm, which Swami calls \"relation-shopping\". The search for a soulmate turns into the opposite of what they are looking for: \"For many people, that's a really soulless experience.\"You're shopping for a partner… going through possibly dozens of people on the dating app until you get to a point where you go… I need to stop,\" he says.The OneJason Carroll, Professor of Marriage and Family Studies at the US Brigham Young University, based in Provo, Utah, is sympathetic to the longing for \"The One\".\"We are attachment-based creatures,\" he says. \"We desire that bond.\" But in his lectures, he tells students they need to leave the idea of a soulmate, without giving up their desire for The One.It sounds like a contradiction, but for Carroll, it's the difference between destiny and graft.\"A soulmate is just simply found. It's already pre‑made. But a one and only is something two people carve out together over years of adapting, apologising, and occasionally gritting their teeth,\" he says.Soulmate trapCarroll's argument draws on decades of research, which he put together in his report, The Soulmate Trap, much of which distinguishes between what psychologists call \"destiny beliefs\" - the idea that the right relationship should feel effortless - and \"growth beliefs\", which focus on what partners can do to make things work.In a widely cited series of studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s led by Professor C. Raymond Knee at the University of Houston, researchers found that people who believed relationships were \"meant to be\" were far more likely to doubt their commitment after conflict. Those with more growth-minded views tended to stay more committed, even on days when they argued.Those with growth-based views, Carroll argues, still want something special, but expect rough patches. \"They ask… what can they do to make their relationship better, have improvement and have growth?\"Getty ImagesResearch suggests people with \"growth\" beliefs about relationships still want something special, but expect challenges along the wayIn his view, the soulmate belief is a trap - not the romance itself, but the expectation that love should never be hard. The most \"soulful\" part of a long relationship, he says, is not a cinematic charge, but having \"front-row seats not only for each other's strengths, but... [their] challenges and weaknesses\".\"That's a pretty sacred space,\" he says. \"We only know those things because they've let us be there.\"For Carroll, when love is treated as fate, people become less willing to do the unshowy work that actually keeps love alive. Carroll says the soulmate trap makes it much harder when a relationship hits its first serious snag.\"The first time there's any type of struggle, the immediate thought is, 'well, I thought you were my soulmate. But maybe you're not, because soulmates aren't supposed to deal with things',\" he says. \"But if relationships are going to go long term, it's never just going to be a downhill run.\"Spark or trauma?Vicki Pavitt, a London-based love coach, often helps people who thought they'd found their soulmate, only to discover that the fairy tale came with emotional manipulation, flakiness, and a constant sense of anxiety.\"When there is a lot of chemistry and the spark, I think that can sometimes be about opening old unhealthy patterns, like old wounds\", she says.\"A person who is inconsistent or plays a bit hot and cold can make you feel 'I can't wait to see them again', but what's really happening is they're giving you so much anxiety and that it has you wanting more\".Vicki PavittLove coach Vicki Pavitt often works with people who thought they'd found a soulmate, only to find the relationship brought anxietyPavitt says what we feel to be destiny may be a pull from our nervous system recognising something that hurt us before and trying to fix it, a pattern therapists call a trauma bond.This bond can seem like love, she says, and leads to people magnetically drawn into unhealthy dynamics because they are familiar, not because they are the perfect match.One study often cited is by Canadian psychologists Donald Dutton and Susan Painter. In research published in 1993 while they were at the University of British Columbia, they followed 75 women after they had left abusive partners.The team measured how strongly the women still felt attached to their exes and compared this with what their relationships had been like.They found the strongest bonds were not in women who had consistently been abused, but in those whose partners alternated between charm and cruelty.Getty ImagesPavitt says what feels like destiny can sometimes be a trauma bondDutton and Painter argue that this trauma bond helps explain why people can feel magnetised back to relationships that are objectively bad for them – because the mix of danger and affection is familiar, not because it is healthy.It is that distinction Pavitt tries to surface in coaching: \"It's about discerning whether the chemistry you feel is showing me this person's compatible with me or if it is a familiar sense of anxiety.\"In my language, I never talk about soulmates,\" she says. \"I don't personally believe that there is one person for everybody... but I do believe that we become \"The One\" for someone.\"Real chemistryIf ruling out the existence of a soulmate sounds unromantic, the biology of attraction points in the same direction.Hormonal contraceptives may subtly reshape how partners feel about each other. Research suggests that pills which flatten the natural ebb and flow of fertility can dampen shifts in attraction that typically occur across the menstrual cycle, potentially altering initial mate choice.PA WireSome research suggests hormonal contraception may subtly influence attraction in partnersOne large study of 365 hetrosexual couples found that women's sexual satisfaction was higher when their current contraceptive status matched what it was when they first chose their partner, hinting that changes in pill use can change how a partner is experienced. These effects are small but could help explain some couples' puzzling shifts in chemistry over time.If hormones and pills can tilt who feels like \"The One\", then it becomes harder to argue there is a single, pre‑ordained match – which is where the mathematicians come in.The one but not the onlyPsychology and biology offer one way of thinking about \"The One\", but mathematics puts forward another.Dr Greg Leo, an economist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, has come up with a compatibility algorithm. It finds that not only might you have a \"One\" you have lots of \"Ones\".In his Matching Soulmates paper in the journal of Public Economic Theory, everyone is in a computer simulated dating pool, where thousands of digitally created daters rank each other. His algorithm picks \"first‑order soulmates\": pairs who choose each other in a stable matching. It removes them, and runs it again with those left, and you get second‑order soulmates, and so on.More from InDepthIn his simulations, it was extremely rare for someone to have their mutual first picks; but many people had those that were second or third picks. In this scenario a couple counts as happy if each is near the top of the other's list and neither can find someone they and that other person would both prefer more.It may only be number crunching, but the love algorithm tells us that there are many viable partners, not just The One.Sweat the small stuffSo how can a couple co-create their Ones?Jacqui Gabb, Professor of Sociology and Intimacy at The Open University, assessed this in her Enduring Love project, published in the journal Sociology in 2015.It surveyed around 5,000 people and then followed 50 couples in forensic, sometimes intrusive detail, combining statistics with diaries, interviews and \"emotion maps\" of what happened in the home.When she asked people what made them feel appreciated, it wasn't sunset proposals or surprise trips to Paris.It was \"surprise gifts, thoughtful gestures and the kindness of a cup of tea in bed\". Warming the car on a cold morning. Picking wildflowers and putting them in a vase. Sharing a private smile at a party.Quantitatively, what she describes as these \"everyday attentive acts\" turned out to be much more powerful than grand romantic gestures.In her survey, 22% of mothers and 20% of childless women picked such small gestures as one of the top two things that made them feel valued – more than big nights out or expensive presents.Relationship satisfaction in the data wasn't primarily about money or romance; it was about \"intimate couple knowledge\" and its expression in daily life.In one young couple's diary given to them for the project, Sumaira describes her partner coming home, the dinner she has cooked, the hug in the hallway, the two of them eating together at the table.\"It's perfect,\" she writes in her research diary. \"Just us and food. What more could I want?\"Then there is a spontaneous dance in the living room, a walk in long grass where she gets scared of the dark, and a photo her partner loves so much he makes it the background on his phone.It reads like a lovely every day tale, not a fairy tale: no glass slippers, but wellies.Yet Gabb points out that woven through the sweetness are money worries, family obligations and a history of depression that the couple are learning to manage together.\"The soulmate feeling here doesn't float above life; it is made, inch by inch, by life, in the way the pair meet those pressures,\" she says.Valentine's DinnerThe science doesn't steal the romance – rather it's there to help it bloom, in good times and bad, according to Carroll.\"I'm pretty comfortable with the aspiration to be in a unique special relationship as long as we remember it needs to be created,\" he says.Pavitt thinks \"it's fine, helpful, even to have faith that your person is out there, so long as you know there are many people that you could form a really great connection with and stop expecting anyone to be perfect\".As for soulmates, the science points to a paradox. The people who end up with relationships that feel uniquely \"meant to be\" are often the ones who stopped waiting for fate, turned towards the flawed person in front of them and said, in effect: shall we make something of this?Additional reporting by Florence FreemanTop image credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "GB's Weston bids for skeleton gold - Friday's guideImage caption, Updated 12 February 2026The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina.Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day seven: Friday, 13 FebruaryMedals: SevenMedal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston in prime position to win gold.The two-time world champion - and Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina - holds an advantage of 0.30 seconds over his nearest rival.The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 – is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?Good to knowWomen's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.Day eight: Saturday, 14 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a yearFreestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.Good to knowThe two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05.Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm.Day nine: Sunday, 15 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Day 10: Monday, 16 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling – Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.Day 11: Tuesday, 17 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Day 12: Wednesday, 18 FebruaryMedals: EightMedal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)\"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,\" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. \"For the past few years, it has been a little bit.\" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

He said this to a journalist at a business summit in Belgium earlier this week.\nSir Keir Starmer, who condemned Sir Jim’s comments has said that he was right to apologise for causing offence. While the businessman was also criticised by Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and other opposition parties and footballing groups, Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has defended him saying ‘Labour may try to ignore [immigration] but Reform won't.’\nJames and Alex are joined by chief football news reporter, reporter Simon Stone. \nPlus the BBC’s climate editor, Justin Rowlatt, joins James and Alex to explain the data that says China’s CO2 emissions have been falling for the past year and what it tells us about the trends for global emissions.\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

    "body": "3 hours agoAlison Holt,Social affairs editorandJames MelleyGetty ImagesA High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge to the equality watchdog's guidance on which public or workplace toilets and changing rooms transgender people should use.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued interim guidance last April and withdrew it six months later. It said single sex spaces, such as toilets and changing rooms, should only be used by people of the same biological sex.It said that a trans woman, a biological male who identifies as a woman, would be expected to use a gender-neutral toilet or the men's toilets, not those for women.Campaigners claimed the guidance for employers, such as hospitals, shops and restaurants, was \"legally flawed\" and \"overly simplistic.\"The judge, Mr Justice Swift, refused the application by campaign group, the Good Law Project (GLP),  for a judicial review, but asked for submissions from all parties on whether an appeal should be allowed.The EHRC's now withdrawn guidance was issued shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in April 2025 that under the 2010 Equality Act, the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" referred to a biological woman and biological sex.Its full guidance, or code of practice, is currently being considered by the government.",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesHello Kitty is a globally recognised brandThe designer behind Hello Kitty is stepping down after 46 years, during which time she oversaw the feline character achieving world recognition.Yuko Yamaguchi took over design duties for the character — who isn't actually a cat, but a little girl from London — in 1980, five years after she first launched.Hello Kitty was immediately popular in Japan, but over Yamaguchi's four-decade tenure has become one of the most lucrative franchises in the world.Sanrio, the firm behind Hello Kitty, said Yamaguchi has \"passed the baton to the next generation\" as it thanked her for her work.Hello Kitty launched as the Japanese 'kawaii' culture — a hyperfeminine, girlish aesthetic — gained popularity across the world.Yamaguchi herself often wore Kitty-style dresses in public and piled her hair in buns.The designer, now aged 70, \"has grown Hello Kitty into a character loved by everyone\", Sanrio said on its website.Getty ImagesYuko Yamaguchi was known to dress like Hello Kitty at eventsThe company said one of its other designers, known only by the pseudonym \"Aya\", has already been working alongside Yamaguchi and will take over by the end of 2026.Yamaguchi will stay with Sanrio to provide advice and support.The Hello Kitty character first appeared on a coin purse in 1980 and has become a global marketing phenomenon.She has appeared on clothes, accessories, video games, and even an Airbus plane. She has partnered with brands such as Unicef, Nintendo and Balenciaga. She has also appeared in float form at the Macy's thanksgiving parade.There are Hello Kitty cafes around the world and a theme park in Japan. Another park is due to open in China.Unlike other Japanese exports such as Pokemon, there is little backstory to the character of Hello Kitty. Sanrio has said she \"isn't a human, [but] she's not quite a cat either\". According to Sanrio, she was born in London and has a twin sister named Mimmy and a boyfriend named Dear Daniel.Kitty will make her cinematic debut in a Warner Bros film in 2028. She has already appeared in several animated series but has never spoken, as she doesn't have a mouth.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentEPAThe Home Office's decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation was unlawful, the High Court has ruled.But the group remains banned for now to allow for further legal arguments and to give the government time to consider an appeal.In a massive blow to the government, three senior judges said that, while Palestine Action uses criminality to promote its aims, its activities had not crossed the very high bar to make it a terrorist organisation.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government would appeal against the court's decision, adding she was \"disappointed\" by the judgment.The decision means that while the group has successfully challenged the ban, expressing support for Palestine Action or taking part in its activities remains a serious criminal offence.A critical issue in the case was whether the ban was impacting the rights of others to protest in support of Palestinian issues, according to the ruling.Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori said it was a \"monumental victory for both our freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people\".She said the Home Office's decision to proscribe the group would \"forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history\". Mahmood said: \"The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by Parliament.\"Responding to the government's intention to appeal the High Court ruling, Ammori said it would be \"profoundly unjust\" for the thousands of people who have been arrested since the ban took effect last July.She added it would be a \"draconian overreach\" to arrest more people on Friday and in the coming weeks for defying the ban, which has been ruled unlawful.After the judgment, the Metropolitan Police said it would not arrest people for expressing support for Palestine Action until court proceedings are fully concluded.But it stressed that despite the \"unusual circumstances\", expressing support is \"still a criminal offence\" and officers will continue to gather evidence of any offences.The proscription made membership of or support for Palestine Action illegal, and more than 2,000 people have been arrested at demonstrations in the months since it came into force.Some 170 of the protesters have been charged with allegedly showing support for the group, which can lead to up to six months in jail.Ammori said the ban had unjustly led to the arrest of thousands of people who had held up signs reading \"I oppose genocide – I support Palestine Action\" - although the High Court said its decision attached \"little weight\" to the circumstances of people who had knowingly supported the group and subsequently been arrested.PA MediaAt least 2,200 people have been arrested at demonstrations since the ban came into effectThe High Court said that when the former home secretary Yvette Cooper decided to ban the organisation last June, she had failed to take into account what impact that decision would have on the right to protest.She had also not fully followed her own policies regarding the test for when an organisation should be proscribed under the Terrorism Act, it added.Prior to the ban, the group's volunteers had been breaking into arms firms linked to Israel, leading to charges of criminal damage.Terrorism legislation permits ministers to ban a group which causes serious damage to property in order to further their cause.The judges said that while \"a very small number\" of Palestine Action's activities met the legal test for acts of terrorism, the standard criminal law could be used to confront the group.They added that when a group is proscribed, people are likely to \"adjust their behaviour\" to avoid the risk they might commit a crime. \"One example of this mentioned in [Ammori's] evidence is her fear that she will be 'no-platformed' – that she will not be invited to speak at events because organisers will be concerned that if someone such as her, previously very closely associated with Palestine Action, does speak that will give rise to an offence under [terrorism legislation],\" the ruling said.Ammori brought the challenge against the ban, with her lawyers arguing it was a \"blatant abuse of power\".The Home Office had tried to stop the judicial hearing from going ahead, arguing that Parliament had set out a specific and alternative process for appealing against banning orders.But ministers' Court of Appeal bid to block the challenge failed in October, paving the way for Friday's ruling.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Palestine Action had engaged in \"organised political violence and cannot be tolerated\". \"Conservatives welcome the Home Office's appeal to this ruling,\" he added.Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said the ban was a \"grave misuse of terrorism laws\" and placing the group in the same legal category as Islamic State \"risked undermining public trust and civil liberties\".Green Party leader Zack Polanski welcomed the ruling, and said those charged with supporting Palestine Action should have their charges dropped.The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said they were \"deeply concerned\" by the High Court ruling and welcomed the home secretary's plan to appeal against it.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames Cook,Scotland editorandPhil Sim,Scotland political correspondentGetty ImagesPeter Murrell is due to appear in court next Friday for a preliminary hearingFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell is facing a charge of embezzling £459,000 from the party over a period of more than 12 years, it has emerged.Details of the case against Murrell, the estranged husband of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, are contained in a copy of an indictment seen by BBC News.According to the document, Murrell is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023.He is accused of illicitly purchasing items including luxury goods, jewellery, cosmetics, two cars and a motorhome.Murrell is due to appear at the High Court in Glasgow on Friday 20 February for a preliminary hearing in the case.He made no plea during an initial appearance at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last year after which he was granted bail.PA MediaMurrell was arrested in 2023 as part of a probe into the SNP's financesMurrell was arrested in 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, a police investigation into the funding and finance of the SNP. He was charged with embezzlement in April 2024.Sturgeon was also questioned by detectives, but police have since confirmed she is no longer under investigation.BBC News has seen a copy of an indictment against Murrell ahead of the preliminary hearing next week.These papers are subject to change up until the point the accused appears in court, and can be altered throughout the judicial process.The indictment includes allegations that Murrell used party funds to buy a £124,550 motorhome \"for your own personal use\" from a dealer in Staffordshire, and that he created false documentation \"to portray the purchase as a legitimate party expense\".Murrell is further accused of using £57,500 of SNP money towards the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-PACE car in 2019.It is also alleged that he falsified an invoice \"in an attempt to disguise the true nature\" of that purchase, and that when the Jaguar was sold in 2021, more than £47,000 was paid into his personal bank account.Murrell is also alleged to have embezzled £16,489 from the SNP in part payment for a £33,000 Volkswagen Golf purchased in Newbridge, Edinburgh, in 2016.The indictment includes a list of more than 80 retailers where Murrell was alleged to have made purchases totalling more than £159,000 between December 2014 and 2022, \"for your own personal use or the personal use of others\".These range from Harrods, the Royal Mint and John Lewis to Homebase and Argos.It claims these purchases were made using credit or charge cards belonging to the SNP, and that \"false or inaccurate accounting codes and descriptions\" for the purchases had been inserted into accounting systems.The indictment also alleges Murrell made purchases with a value of over £81,600 through online retailer Amazon in the same manner.Murrell held the position of SNP chief executive for 22 years.He married Sturgeon in 2010, but the former party leader and first minister announced their separation in January 2025.",

I am heartbroken. \"We were together to the very end, at home, in our own bed and holding hands which is exactly what he wanted.\"She said that in their last conversation, she asked him how he was feeling and he had replied \"rough but in love\". \"That was so him, to the point and choosing to put aside his fears to make me feel cherished and loved\". \"John you are a class act and I will love you forever,\" she wrote.There has been an outpouring of support following the news, including from fellow influencers.Hague wrote: \"Heartbroken for you. Rest in peace John, I am so beyond sorry for your loss.\"Former This Morning presenter Willoughby said she was \"so sorry...sending love\", while ex-Saturdays singer and presenter Rochelle Humes wrote: \"I love you my darling and I'm so sorry. We are all here.\"Luxe met Andrews in a bar in Brighton through mutual friends when she was 25 and he was 46, according to the Sun, and married a year later in New York.They were married for 16 years and lived together in Warwickshire.  Luxe became well known for her fashion content but also for giving fans an insight into her life with with her husband.Andrews was first diagnosed with stage three adrenal cancer in April 2023 and underwent chemotherapy, Luxe said. He then went into remission in November 2023, but six months later, the cancer spread to his brain. A phaeochromocytoma is a rare tumour of the adrenal glands, which sit above the kidneys, the NHS says. Most do not spread to other parts of the body but about one in 10 do, according to the NHS. In December 2025 Luxe said on social media her husband had been rushed to Warwick Hospital with organ failure, and later contracted neutropenic sepsis which can be a complication of chemotherapy. Luxe said the hospital \"prepared me for the worst\", but he was later sent home two days before Christmas. \"He's not well. I'm not going to sugarcoat this and say that he's doing really well, he's still really unwell,\" she told her followers. \"But I think he's so much happier here [at home]\". Talking about the prospect of his death she told Fabulous magazine: \"Fundamentally, I'm probably going to be a widow at some point in my 40s and that's a bit of a scary place to be for any woman.\"Who is Lorna Luxe?Getty ImagesThe couple accumulated £50,000 worth of debt creating a luxurious social media presence, Luxe has saidLuxe, whose real name is Lorna Andrews, grew up on a council estate in Trafford, Greater Manchester, before working as cabin crew for Virgin Atlantic. She first rose to fame on Instagram in the late 2010s, creating content which mixed high street and luxury fashion. She has been described as the OG or original influencer who paved the way for other Instagram personalities. But it was not always glamorous.She told the We Need to Talk podcast the couple accumulated about \"£50,000 worth of debt, spending on things like trips so we could create content\".\"I was so adamant that this would be a career for me, I just needed the opportunity,\" she said. Luxe started partnering with businesses and creating fashion collections which she said made the debt worth it, earning \"like £80,000\" from one brand in a month.With one simple social media tag of a business, Luxe's influence could make products sell out. \"We'd call it the Lorna Luxe effect,\" Odd Muse fashion designer Aimee Smale told the Passenger Princess podcast.

    "body": "4 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterGetty ImagesOne clip features footage of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting in a film sceneMajor US studios have demanded that a powerful new AI video tool, launched by TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance, must \"immediately cease\" infringing copyright with its clips based on existing films and shows.Many of the clips are based on real actors, TV shows and films, and the Motion Picture Association told the BBC: \"In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale.\"The MPA represents the major US studios - Netflix, Paramount Pictures, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures, Universal Studios, The Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros Discovery.According to ByteDance, the product has already suspended the ability for people to upload images of real people, and it respects intellectual property rights and copyright protections, and takes any potential infringement seriously.The content referenced was created as part of a limited pre-launch testing phase, it said.Seedance/X/AI-generated imageAn AI-generated clip of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise fighting has gone viralThe AI tool can quickly make highly realistic clips from a short, simple text prompt, such as a fist fight between Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, Will Smith battling a red-eyed spaghetti monster or even Friends characters reimagined as otters.The MPA's chairman and CEO, Charles Rivkin, said: \"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.\"ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity.\"According to ByteDance, steps are being taken to further address risks, and it will implement robust policies, monitoring mechanisms and processes to ensure compliance with local regulations.The clips have been flooding social media, and users have also been posting scenes based on shows and films like The Lord of the Rings, Seinfeld, Avengers and Breaking Bad.ByteDance has billed its new AI tool as delivering \"an ultra-realistic immersive experience\".It immediately set alarm bells ringing in Hollywood and beyond, with Deadpool writer Rhett Reese warning: \"I hate to say it. It's likely over for us.\"A review by US magazine Forbes noted that Seedance 2.0 \"offers a level of creative control that mimics a human director\" and \"enables users to create high-end outputs without needing complicated production tools\".While many users are likely to be delighted to have its powers at their fingertips, Reese, who co-wrote and executive produced the Deadpool films among others, said he was \"terrified\" by the implications.\"So many people I love are facing the loss of careers they love. I myself am at risk,\" he wrote.\"When I wrote 'It's over,' I didn't mean it to sound cavalier or flippant. I was blown away by the Pitt v Cruise video because it is so professional. That's exactly why I'm scared.\"My glass half empty view is that Hollywood is about to be revolutionized/decimated. If you truly think the Pitt v Cruise video is unimpressive slop, you've got nothing to worry about. But I'm shook.\"'Original ideas are the hardest part'Heather Anne Campbell, who has written for Saturday Night Live and Rick & Morty, said the results were akin to fan fiction, and that people would still be required to come up with original ideas.\"All of these people who have access to the latest AI visualisation engines, like Seedance - they're being given total control to create anything they can imagine - and they're turning out fanfiction,\" she wrote. \"'Breaking bad new scene' or 'goku in live action' etc.\"Seems like it's challenging to make something new even when you have the infinite budget to make lifelike tv, film, or animation. Almost like the original ideas are the hardest part.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.\"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" he wrote on X. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers' costs by $2,400 per vehicle, the White House claimed.These regulations have been an economic strain, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during the first Trump term.\"The burden on the economy results in higher prices and manufacturing has left. It's gone to China, where it's made in a dirtier way,\" she told the BBC. \"So to say that we're reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it's made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.\"Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" Meghan Greenfield said.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

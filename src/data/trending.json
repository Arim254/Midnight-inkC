What’s really going on with Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine?AmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has posted on social media that ‘something good just may be happening’ when it comes to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, after overnight talks in Geneva.\nEuropean leaders criticised a 28-point US peace plan when it emerged last week, saying it was too favourable to Russia. A new plan has been promised, but President Zelensky has played down Trump’s hopes of progress.\nSarah, Anthony and Marianna join Matt Chorley on 5 Live to answer your questions. We look at who’s actually involved in putting the plan together? And what does Donald Trump stand to gain from the proposed deal?\nPlus, the MAGA icon and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from Congress following her bitter feud with the president last week. Could we start to see power shifts within the MAGA movement following her departure? And why did Trump say the behaviour of some Democrats was “punishable by death”?\nPlus, what happened when the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, met Donald Trump in the White House on Friday? Clips of the meeting quickly went viral, with users commenting on the warmth between the two leaders. Is this the start of a fruitful friendship between Trump and Mamdani - or is it all just for show?\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "7 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentLawyers for Palestine Action have said the group can be compared to the suffragettes, in a challenge against the government's ban.On the first day of a three day judicial review at the High Court, lawyers for the group's co-founder Huda Ammori said the votes-for-women movement would have faced the same ban if today's laws had been in place more than 100 years ago.Palestine Action was listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation after causing millions of pounds worth of damage to defence firms.The then Home Secretary Yvette Cooper proscribed the group after internal Home Office security assessments of its activity.Raza Husain KC, for Ms Ammori, told the court the ban was unprecedented.Around 200 people protested peacefully outside during the opening of the challenge - with scores of them silently holding up signs saying \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.\"Several sign-holders were then arrested by police. Since the ban, more than 2,100 people have been arrested nationwide for taking part in similar protests.In court, Mr Husain KC told a panel of three senior judges that, in the entire history of home secretaries using exceptional powers to ban a group under terrorism legislation, no minister had ever proscribed a group for being a \"direct action\" organisation.He said that Palestine Action was followed by hundreds of thousands of people on social media before it was banned. Most of its \"actionists\" - meaning people who had taken part in protests and alleged vandalism at defence firms and associated companies - had been arrested or charged with standard offences such as criminal damage.Ministers say that a series of incidents organised by the group went further than minor vandalism, by causing millions of pounds in damage, justifying the decision to ban the group.\"Palestine Action is the first direct action civil disobedience organisation that does not advocate for violence ever to be proscribed as terrorist,\" Mr Husain KC said.\"Ms Huda Ammori has explained that she was inspired by the long tradition in this country from suffragettes to anti-apartheid activists, to Iraq war activists.\"The suffragettes had resorted to direct action, property damage and even attempted arson at Westminster Abbey.\"His written submissions to the court added: \"The suffragettes would have been liable to proscription if the Terrorism Act 2000 regime had been in force at the turn of the 20th century.\"Ms Ammori's lawyers argue that the ban is unlawful because it disproportionately interferes with the right to freedom of expression and assembly - and the then home secretary failed to consider that impact.They also argue that Cooper should have consulted the group before banning it and that she failed to take into account her own policy that such a decision had to be proportionate.Owen Greenhall, another of Ms Ammori's lawyers, argued that the impact of the ban was so wide it had deterred legitimate protest outside a key defence firm that has been targeted by the group since its founding.Anyone who wanted to take part in such a disruptive protest, as had regularly happened before the ban, would risk being labelled a member of Palestine Action.The case continues on Thursday, when government lawyers will respond. In their written submissions to the court, made public on Wednesday, they argue that ministers acted lawfully in identifying incidents which they believed justified a ban under terrorism legislation - and that they did not have to take into account that the vast majority of Palestine Action's activity had fallen short of that test.The case then returns to court next Tuesday for final submissions, including a secret \"closed\" hearing for national security reasons.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterGetty ImagesKevin Spacey was cleared of nine sexual offence charges at a criminal trial in 2023Actor Kevin Spacey is set to face civil claims of sexual assault from three men at the High Court in London next October.The men have sued the star, alleging that he assaulted them between 2000 and 2013.At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge suggested a provisional trial date of 12 October 2026. The claims could be heard in a single trial, or in three consecutive trials to hear each case.Mr Spacey denies all allegations of wrongdoing. He has formally denied two of the claims and is yet to file a defence with the court in the third. He was separately cleared of nine sexual offence charges at a criminal trial in 2023.Two of the men who accused the Oscar-winning star during the criminal trial have also filed civil legal cases at the High Court.One man, known only as LNP, alleges that Mr Spacey \"deliberately assaulted\" him on about 12 occasions between 2000 and 2005.Another, referred to as GHI, says he met Mr Spacey through a workshop at London's Old Vic theatre and claims he \"suffered psychiatric damage and financial loss\" as a result of an assault in 2008.Mr Spacey was artistic director of the Old Vic between 2004 and 2013.The man originally sued Mr Spacey in 2022 but his case was paused when the criminal charges were brought.The third man, Ruari Cannon, has waived his right to anonymity.He was in Tennessee Williams' play Sweet Bird of Youth at the Old Vic in 2013, and alleges that Mr Spacey groped him at a party after the show's press night.Mr Cannon took part in a Channel 4 documentary, Spacey Unmasked, in 2024.Mr Spacey said the allegation was \"ridiculous and it never happened\".Elizabeth-Anne Gumbel KC, representing the trio, said in written submissions that the cases should be heard in a single trial to avoid the men and Mr Spacey giving evidence more than once.The US actor has previously admitted \"bad behaviour\" and \"being too handsy\" at times, but said he would not use the word \"grope\" to describe his actions.At his criminal trial in London in 2023, he was acquitted of seven counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoe McFaddenHealth reporterAn NHS resident doctor has been suspended by a medical tribunal for 15 months after posting alleged antisemitic comments on social media.Dr Rahmeh Aladwan, a 31-year-old trainee trauma and orthopaedic surgeon, was also alleged to have expressed support for \"violent action and terrorist organisations\".The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) said Dr Aladwan's posts \"may impact on patient confidence\" in both her and the profession, while patients could be \"discouraged\" from seeking treatment from her.Dr Aladwan, who is British Palestinian, denies making racist or hate speech.She is currently the subject of a fitness to practise investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), an independent body that regulates doctors, physician associates and anaesthesia associates to protect patient safety.The GMC began its investigation following complaints that Dr Aladwan had made antisemitic or offensive comments on posts that also appeared to support terrorism.The tribunal heard that Dr Aladwan's alleged posts on X included antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as posts that \"demonise, or express and encourage hatred towards Jews in general, their history and their way of life\".Her lawyer told the tribunal there was \"no evidence\" that her activities have had \"any impact on patient safety or her ability to fulfil her duties as a doctor\".Dr Aladwan's suspension will take effect from today and will be reviewed within six months.The hearing, which took place in Manchester, was an interim orders tribunal (IOT), deciding whether Dr Aladwan's practice should be restricted while the GMC's investigation takes place.It does not rule on the allegations under investigation.In the tribunal's ruling, it said it \"notes that there is no information to suggest that any patient complaints have been raised or that any patients have come to harm\".Dr Aladwan was previously subject to an IOT in September, which determined that no restrictions should be imposed upon her.On 3 October 2025, a decision was made to refer Dr Aladwan's case to an IOT hearing again after the GMC alleged an \"escalation in the tone of Dr Aladwan's social media posts\" following the September ruling and the Manchester synagogue attack in early October.Responding to the tribunal's ruling on X, Dr Aladwan said: \"Let this decision stand as the definitive proof that there is no independent British medical regulation. The 'Israeli' and Jewish lobby decide who can and cannot practise medicine in Britain.\"She added: \"This is not an end. It is the beginning of a far greater battle for the integrity of our institutions.\"The GMC's social media guidance states that medical professionals have the right to \"freedom of belief, privacy, and expression\" but that using social media \"has to be balanced with the possible impact on other people's rights and interests\".",

    "body": "13 minutes agoWall-to-wall coverage of the Budget dominates the daily papers, unpacking the tax and spend measures announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the Commons. \"High welfare, high tax\" is the Times's take, saying Reeves will \"raise taxes to the highest levels in history\". The paper explains \"one in four taxpayers, equivalent to 10.6m people, will be higher or additional-rate taxpayers by 2030\". It includes the Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR)'s forecast, which says \"the rises would hit living standards and could 'constrain economic activity'\".\"Budget goes as billed\" is the Metro's take. \"You're paying!\", it adds, writing the chancellor \"will make working people pay £26bn more tax – a year after vowing no rises\". The paper recounts a \"clanger by the Office for Budget Responsibility which posted its verdict on [the chancellor's] plan 40 minutes too early\". It caused a \"brief stock market roller-coaster\", it reports, with the Conservatives demanding \"a criminal investigation\".The Financial Times focuses on reaction to the Budget, citing official forecasts and economist views, while underlining it \"smashes tax records\" in the headline. \"The OBR said a weaker outlook and rising tax burden would squeeze household finances,\" the paper says. Meanwhile, it writes the \"bond markets welcome decision to increase Exchequer's fiscal headroom\".\"Spend now, pay later\" is the i Paper's take, as the chancellor lays out plans to \"boost benefits and tackle UK black hole\". The paper quotes Reeves saying \"ordinary people\" must \"pay a little bit more\" as \"1.8m workers are dragged into a higher income tax band\". \"Millions more to pay higher income tax\" is the Independent's headline and key takeaway. The chancellor confirms \"43 tax increases to raise a record extra £26bn\". It says Reeves \"scrapped\" the two-child benefit cap, adding £9bn to welfare spending.The Daily Mail describes Reeves's measures as \"spiteful raids on strivers\", referring to what it calls a \"Budget shambles\" and saying the chancellor's message is \"if you work hard and save prudently, I'm coming for you\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's assessment leads the Daily Express: \"A Budget for benefit street\". She believes the new measures will hit \"hard-working Britons\" hardest as the government looks to \"increase welfare spending to £406bn by 2030-31\" for measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap.The Sun headlines on what it calls a \"benefits street\" Budget, saying: \"Workers and savers were clobbered... to fund the ballooning welfare bill\". The Tories now accuse the chancellor of breaking \"Labour's manifesto promises\", it writes, and says Rachel Reeves has \"refused to rule out further punishing hikes\".Photoshop, or another image-altering programme, has assisted the Daily Star in portraying Reeves as the Christmas Grinch on its front page, a grumpy green-skin fictional character who \"stole Christmas\" in its eponymous film. The Star nicknames the chancellor \"Rachel Thieves\", accusing her of delivering a Budget that is \"all tax, tax, tax, and spend, spend, spend\".\"Budget with a Labour heart\" is the Daily Mirror's take, saying it was \"crafted with ordinary people in mind\". The paper calls the two-child benefit cap \"cruel\", saying the policy \"trapped 450,000 kids in poverty\". It also writes that \"Reeves hiked gambling taxes and placed a levy on homeowners with £2 million properties\".The Daily Telegraph says Reeves's fiscal statement contain \"broken promises\", including a \"new tax on homes worth more than £2m\" and other measure it says will affect \"pensions and savings\". Reeves gave \"assurances\" after the last Budget's \"£40bn of tax rises\" there would be \"no further increases before the next election\", according to the paper.The Guardian leads by quoting the chancellor saying \"I am asking everyone to make a contribution\" and later explaining that this was \"to repair the public finances\". Reeves says she \"avoided reckless borrowing and dangerous cuts\", while the paper notes the tax share as a proportion of GDP will hit an \"all-time high of 38%\" by 2030.Related Internet Links",

It was inspired by the strict dress code and atmosphere of London's Blitz Club during the early 1980s.Hogg told the BBC's Kirsty Wark: \"I started making clothes when I was about five years old from all the hand-me-downs from neighbours – more wealthy neighbours but they probably weren't that wealthy, just better off than us. And I was really formulating my look way back then.\"The designer's clothes, as well as her personal visual identity, embraced futuristic beauty looks, bold hair, punk sensibilities, and a strong sense of androgyny.One of her most memorable contributions to fashion is her interpretation of the catsuit.It became a signature statement of her aesthetic and she continued to create catsuits throughout her career for stars such as Minogue, Rihanna and Lady Gaga.Supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer and singers Jessie J, Björk, Siouxsie Sioux, Grace Jones and Kelly Rowland are among the other stars who wore Hogg's designs over the years.In 1989, Hogg opened her first standalone boutique on Newburgh Street, just off Carnaby Street in London.Princess Diana once wore one of Hogg's dresses, while Princess Eugenie wore one of her custom designs to Ascot in 2013.In 2016, Hogg designed the statuette for the Brit Awards, producing 13 trophies characterised by her distinctive use of glitter and metallic tones.Hogg was a music artist in her own right and supported Debbie Harry of Blondie and The Pogues, before founding the band Doll.

    "body": "6 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorThe biggest initial surprise in this Budget may have been that the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) managed to publish it all by mistake long before Chancellor Rachel Reeves got to read it out. There is no precedent for that.But actually the real surprise was that the government's financial position is nowhere near as bad as had been suggested in the run-up.I had warned in a few live appearances not to take at full face value the protestations about how dire the OBR forecast had been. There are always a lot of moving parts when you project long term.Yes the economy is forecast to grow more slowly than expected because long-term productivity has been downgraded, but it also starts from a better base thanks to outperformance and upgrades this year. On top of that, higher wages due to high inflation have boosted the Treasury's tax take. Very interestingly, the OBR has also made a judgement that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could boost productivity by a notable and growing amount by the end of the year.The net result of all that is the OBR forecasts show she could have met her self-imposed rules of only borrowing to invest and cover day-to-day spending with tax  receipts, without freezing income tax thresholds.So why did she do way more than expected? By freezing thresholds for a further three years until 2031, she is dragging most people into paying more tax including pulling almost one in four people into the higher rate tax bracket.If it wasn't for her U-turn on welfare reforms, she would have been on track to actually meet her target by a whisker before she made any changes to tax and spending.So this gets us to the big story of this Budget of two halves. A Budget that borrows to spend on political priorities in the next year or so, and then taxes hard to get borrowing down in the final years of the decade.This is about buying breathing space, politically and economically. The two factors are inseparable.By borrowing to spend, the chancellor and prime minister have shored up their immediate position in parliament and it appears to put to bed the shocking doubts  about passing their budgets. The Labour left is getting behind this Budget as it spends to help alleviate child poverty, to lower energy bills, and to freeze rail fares and prescriptions. This is important for the financial markets which need to know, whether they love the policies or not, that the government has the votes to pass its Budget.By subsequently taxing hard to double the amount of breathing space or headroom to £22bn a year around her borrowing targets, Reeves gets space from the uncomfortable glare of the markets. Add in the fact that there will now only be an annual check of the fiscal rules rather than a bi-annual one, and with a fair wind, this should put to bed the hamster wheel of speculation about missing borrowing targets. This has been a force for instability, and lack of credibility over the last year, and ultimately led to the calamitous U-turn on welfare cuts over the summer.The net result of all this and a slightly lower than expected issuance of UK government bonds, was that markets were more than calm. Despite the rollercoaster of a day, the effective interest rate on government bonds was down across the board, and on occasion was a notable 10 basis points or 0.1% down on the key bonds.The message has been heard in the markets, and at first glance in her own party.Now this has come at a price. Taxes will go up to new records in 2028. How will that be squared with the need for growth?I detect an unspoken strategy. The government hopes that growth will exceed the solid pedestrian predictions of 1.5%. If that is the case, we might not ever get to this extended threshold freeze. There is also hope the choices made will enable the Bank of England to cut interest rates further.For this to work, growth will have to come. There is some space for green shoots to sprout now, or at least for the animal spirits of the economy to emerge from non-stop chaos. This applies to business investment plans, and those older consumers who have been hoarding savings and not spending.It's no guarantee of success, but there is some space now for a more stable backdrop.",

    "body": "10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite will need to pay an extra fee, the Trump administration says.The Department of the Interior, which runs the country's national parks, said each international visitor will need to pay $100 (£76) per person on top of existing fees to access 11 of the most popular sites.From 2026, non-residents will also need to pay more than $250 for an annual pass to the parks, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80.The fee hike aims to \"put American families first\" and reflects President Donald Trump's goal to make the parks more accessible and affordable for US citizens, said the department.\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.The increase will take effect at the start of 2026, alongside the launch of an upgraded online booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, \"patriotic fee-free\" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.The fee hike follows an executive order, signed by Trump in July, to raise entrance fees at national parks for overseas visitors. The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as the Trump administration planned deep cuts to the Park Service budget.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.The country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJonny Humphries,at Liverpool Crown Court andLauren Hirst,North WestCPSPaul Doyle broke down in tears as he quietly answered guilty to all 31 chargesPaul Doyle has pleaded guilty to all 31 charges after ploughing his car into a dense crowd of supporters at the Liverpool FC victory parade. The 54-year-old admitted dangerous driving, affray, 17 charges of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, nine counts of causing GBH with intent and three counts of wounding with intent.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was an \"act of calculated violence\" when Doyle drove into the crowd on the evening of the 26 May, injuring more than 130 people. The father-of-three, of Croxteth, Liverpool, sat with his head down and sobbed as he changed his pleas on the second day of his trial at Liverpool Crown Court.  Thousands of Liverpool fans were in the city on the day of Doyle's attack to watch the parade, which started at 14:30 BST on 26 May. The team bus had travelled down The Strand, which passes the end of Water Street, before the incident and the parade was coming to a close, with supporters heading home.EPAThe incident unfolded on Water Street just after 18:00More than 130 people reported injuries after Doyle drove his Ford Galaxy Titanium into crowds on Water Street just after 18:00.He was arrested at the scene and charged later that week.Recap: Paul Doyle changes his pleas on the second day of his trialA jury was sworn in for his trial on Tuesday but he changed his pleas earlier as the prosecution case was due to be opened.The charges relate to 29 people aged between six months and 77 years.Footage of the incident was shared after the incident Doyle, a former Royal Marine, was in tears at a number of pre-trial hearings when he appeared over videolink from prison.He was supported in court by family members when he appeared earlier. The Recorder of Liverpool Andrew Menary KC told Doyle it was \"inevitable\" he would be facing a custodial sentence \"of some length\".A two-day sentencing hearing was set for 15 and 16 December at the same court.Julia QuenzlerA jury had been sworn in for Doyle's trial on TuesdaySarah Hammond, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Doyle had finally accepted that he intentionally drove into crowds of innocent people.\"Dashcam footage from Doyle's vehicle shows that as he approached Dale Street and Water Street, he became increasingly agitated by the crowds,\" she said. \"Rather than wait for them to pass, he deliberately drove at them, forcing his way through.\"She added driving a vehicle into a crowd was \"an act of calculated violence\". \"This was not a momentary lapse by Paul Doyle — it was a choice he made that day and it turned celebration into mayhem.\"In May, Merseyside Police said they believed Doyle had followed an ambulance on to Water Street after a road block was temporarily lifted for crews to attend to a person having a heart attack.Det Ch Insp John Fitzgerald said it was only \"by sheer luck that nobody was killed because of Doyle's reckless actions\".\"In just seven minutes his dangerous driving meant that his car collided with more than 100 people, including children, in some cases trapping people underneath and causing serious injuries.\"What should have been a day of celebration for the city turned into a distressing and frightening experience which we know continues to have a physical and psychological impact on many people.\"Following the hearing, councillor Liam Robinson confirmed Liverpool City Council's independent review into what happened would be published soon.",

With the legislation having been drafted as a private member's bill by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, there is a hard deadline on when agreement must be reached with peers.Approval for the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would need to be approved by both the Commons and the Lords before spring when the current session of Parliament ends.If passed, it would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales with fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.Critics and opponents of the bill have insisted the legislation requires significant re-drafting to ensure any system properly protects vulnerable people.However, peers had managed to discuss fewer than 30 of the more than 1,000 amendments lodged after two of the four days reserved for committee stage, when the bill is scrutinised line-by-line.With only two more sessions scheduled before the end of the year, Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with cancer, last week warned peers not to \"sabotage democracy\".Leadbeater has also shared her concern that \"some of the processes and procedures that can be used are being used to frustrate the bill, and that is deeply disappointing and upsetting\".Now, the government's chief whip in the Lords has announced 10 extra Fridays will be given for debate in the Lords, spread over a number of weeks in the New Year between 9 January and 24 April.Lord Roy Kennedy said it is \"clear the House needs additional time to scrutinise the Bill\" given the high number of amendments.He said: \"I have always been clear that as this government is neutral on the Bill any additional time will not come from government time.\"I also believe given the importance of the subject and the number of colleagues wishing to participate, that this scrutiny could not take place in the Grand Committee, as some have suggested to me.\"I have therefore arranged for the House to sit on an additional eight additional Fridays in the New Year in addition to the three Fridays already announced.\"He added the government is not trying to \"prescribe\" how the Bill will progress, given its neutral stance.Welcoming the decision, backbencher Leadbeater said she was pleased extra days had been granted to deal with the large number of amendments.\"It is right that peers use their expertise and experience to properly scrutinise the Bill and propose improvements to strengthen it where necessary,\" she said.\"These extra days provide an unprecedented amount of debating time for a private members' bill.  \"There is little doubt that these days, used responsibly and constructively, will allow the Bill progress through the Lords and enable Parliament to give dying people choice and dignity in their final days and protect their loved ones from the threat of prosecution.\"Lord Charlie Falconer, who is steering the Bill through the Lords, said the extra dates mean that up to 24 April, there will have been 16 days for consideration of the legislation in the Lords.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "6 hours agoColette HumeBBC WalesGwent PoliceAntonio Villafane has been jailed for eight years for his treatment of Sally Ann NormanWarning: This story contains details of physical and emotional abuse.A man who subjected his partner to seven years of violent abuse, leaving her homeless, penniless and suicidal, has been jailed for eight years.Antonio Villafane, from Tintern, Monmouthshire, imprisoned Sally Ann Norman in a caravan, forced her to wear a full face covering to hide her bruises and spent her £280,000 divorce settlement.The 67-year-old was found guilty of coercive control, strangulation, unlawful wounding, actual bodily harm and fraud.At Newport Crown Court, Judge Daniel Williams told Villafane, also known as Anthony Manson: \"You worked your way through the domestic abuser's playbook.\"The couple lived off-grid in a caravan near Tintern after meeting in 2015 as Mrs Norman's 25-year marriage was ending.A jury was told the nurse and therapist, now 64, escaped from him in July 2022 after he tried to strangle her during her 61st birthday meal.Judge Williams said Villafane charmed his partner and pretended to be caring and generous.In a statement to the court, Mrs Norman said she felt \"guilt and shame\" about \"being led down the garden path\" by Villafane.Their relationship had developed quickly, she told the court, and within seven years he had isolated her from her parents, children and friends.He would not allow her to attend a memorial service for her father in Edinburgh and took her mobile phone away, telling her it was a privilege that had to be earned.Their isolated lifestyle meant he could abuse her in secret, the court heard.She told police she was punched, kicked and hit with a walking stick and made to stay in the caravan they lived in for hours, often without food and water.She has since been diagnosed with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and the injuries he inflicted have left her walking with a stick because of balance issues.He spent her £280,000 divorce settlement and beat and imprisoned herShe recalled Villafane tying her up and pushing her head into a dirty water-filled toolbox until she almost passed out.He once forced her to stand naked in the cold and dark and \"pray for forgiveness\", a jury was told.The court heard he has 15 convictions from 37 offences going back to 1971  including violence, fraud, theft, drugs, offensive weapons and public disorder.This year, he was convicted of animal cruelty for not ensuring the welfare of a horse.Martha Smith-Higgins, defending, said Villafane had a previous diagnosis of personality disorder with psychotic features.In addition to the prison sentence, Villafane was given an indefinite restraining order, barring him from contacting Mrs Norman and those close to her.Judge Williams told Villafane: \"You chose not to give evidence or subject yourself to the discomfort of scrutiny.\"Like any hard work, you left giving evidence to Sally Ann.\"You remained in the dock, relying on your lies in your police interview that she was delusional and you had only tried to help her grow.\"The effect on her is hard to put into words. The effect is difficult to overstate.\"You set out to ruin her life and in many ways her life lies in ruins.\"If you have been affected by any issues in this report, help and support is available on the BBC Action Line.More top stories",

    "body": "Health officials in Glasgow are planning to make the case for a smoking space to be added to the city's drug consumption room.The Thistle, which opened on Hunter Street in January, is a facility in which people can inject heroin or cocaine while under medical supervision without being prosecuted.Officials involved in the three-year pilot project say a smoking space for taking cocaine is \"critical in order to realise the full benefit\" of the facility.Members of the city's integration joint board (IJB) — which oversees health and social care services — will be asked to approve the development of a business case for an inhalation space later.Since the Thistle opened, cocaine has been reported as 67% of substances injected, but officials said there is anecdotal evidence of a shift to smoking or inhalation of drugs, particularly cocaine.The IJB report states recent overdose clusters in Glasgow have been \"linked to increased smoking/inhalation of crack cocaine which has been contaminated with other substances.\"In September Glasgow's health board warned drug users against inhaling crack cocaine following a series of suspected drug incidents.It is currently not legal for Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership to operate a smoking room, but it is planning talks with the Scottish government over amending regulations to define the Thistle as an \"exempt service\".The Thistle is able to operate after the Lord Advocate announced users would not be prosecuted for possessing illegal drugs while on the site.A report to the IJB states if a smoking/inhalation room is added then the statement of prosecution policy may need to be amended, requiring further discussions with the Crown Office and the Lord Advocate.Legal issues, as well as costs and staffing and the best location for the space, would be explored during the development of the full business case.A room for smoking drugs was included in the original plans, but was dropped due to potential delays while legal issues were explored, as well as extra costs and ventilation requirements.Cocaine was implicated in 52% of drug-related deaths in Glasgow in 2024.Officials added feedback highlighted the lack of inhalation spaces as \"the main barrier to using the service\".The report said creating a smoking/inhalation space would let staff encourage clients to transition from injection to smoking, as well as reach out to users who do not use the Thistle.Inhalation rooms consist of individual enclosed booths that have a ventilation system designed to remove smoke and vapour. Community engagement on the proposed service is planned.By 31 October, 494 individuals had registered to use the Thistle, with 8,236 visits and 5,552 recorded injecting episodes. Staff had managed 69 medical emergencies and over 360 referrals to other services had been made.Most often these referrals were to housing services but also to alcohol and drug recovery services and other clinical services.Last week the UK government said it would not make changes to drug laws to allow the creation of more legal drug consumption rooms.Reporting by local democracy reporter Drew Sandelands.",

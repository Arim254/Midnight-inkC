BBC chief North America correspondent Gary O’Donoghue and the Economist’s Shashank Joshi break it all down. \nAnd the former Labour Minister Andrew Gwynne confirmed his plans to retire on medical grounds triggering a by-election that could pave the way for Andy Burnham to run and ultimately launch a leadership challenge against Keir Starmer.

    "body": "German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe.The man, named as \"Mohammad S\", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening.Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions.He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention.Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries.The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action.German authorities say \"Mohammad S\" colluded with \"Abed Al G\", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions.The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon.Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported.Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDearbail JordanGetty ImagesAlex Honnold was the first climber to perform a rope-free ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite National ParkAn American climber has postponed scaling the Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest buildings, rope-free for another 24 hours due to wet weather.     Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: \"Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing.\" The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick.Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen.\"It's obviously a conversation that everybody has,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. \"We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"The climb is now due to take place on Sunday.  Announcing the delay, Netflix said: \"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.\"Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope.Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight \"bamboo\" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Getty ImagesTaipei 101's surfaces were deemed too wet for a climb on Saturday Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was \"a lifelong dream\" to scale a skyscraper.His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award.An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.More from the BBC",

    "body": "6 hours agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

    "body": "6 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if the country's prime minister strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday. Tensions between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have escalated in recent days, after Carney gave a speech in Davos, Switzerland, pushing against the world's great powers.He recently met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and announced their countries had reached a trade deal that included electric vehicles.At the time, Trump hailed the potential deal as \"a good thing\". It is unclear if that deal has come into effect, or if Trump was referring to it specifically. The BBC has reached out to the White House, Carney's office and Canada's minister responsible for US-Canada trade for comment.In his Saturday post, Trump referred to the prime minister as \"Governor Carney\" and  wrote that if \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"Trump did not provide a timeline or more information about the threatened tariff. Last year, when he first threatened new tariffs on the US northern neighbour, Trump began calling Canada the US's \"51st state\" with Carney as its \"governor\", and suggested he may try to acquire the country entirely. While the countries' relationship had been improving in recent months, Trump's push to take control of Greenland and his comments about Nato have put him at odds with Canadian and European leaders. Carney did not mention the president by name in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week, but he warned of a \"rupture\" in US-led world order, which seemed to anger Trump.\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said in his own address, which followed Carney's.Trump then on Friday withdrew Canada's invitation to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, which is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts. At the same time, he blasted Canada in a social media post for being \"against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland\", referring to the anti-missile shield he has planned, and for \"doing business with China\".In discussing the deal with China, where Canada would ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and China would lower levies on Canadian agricultural products,  earlier this month, Carney told reporters that  \"the world has changed\" and progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".He added that Canada's relationship with China has become \"more predictable\" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration.Experts told the BBC Canada's policy on China has undergone a significant shift, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner.When he returned to office last year, Trump put new tariffs on goods from Canada, including a 35% tax on all items that don't fall under a free trade agreement between the two countries that is currently under mandatory review.Carney pushed back on Trump son Thursday saying that Canada and the US \"have built a remarkable partnership\" over many decades.\"But Canada doesn't live because of the United States,\" he said. \"Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"",

    "body": "A new NHS database of genes linked to cancer could enable patients and their families in England to find out whether they are at risk of developing the disease.People will be able to have their genetic information compared to the world-first register of 120 genes known to increase the likelihood of getting cancer, NHS England has said.Those identified as having an inherited risk will be offered routine check-ups and screening for certain cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Patients could also be tested to see whether they would respond better to particular treatments, allowing for personalised care.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"life-changing and life-saving\" tool would fast-track screening and allow more cancers to be caught sooner.Tens of thousands of cancer patients and those with a family history of the disease already undergo genetic testing on the NHS every year. Those known to have a higher risk profile will be added to the new register.They will be given tailored information about what they can do to lower their chance of developing cancer or detect it early.The NHS said it was building the register as part of a 10-year plan to improve prevention and treatment of cancer. NHS England's national cancer director told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"the first time any health care system has brought together all the information about all the genetic risk into a single place.\"Prof Peter Johnson said it pulled together the tests patients were already offered to check their cancer susceptibility into a single register, \"so that we can contact people to offer them screening and in some cases preventative treatment\".This will allow practitioners to \"keep tabs on people\" and offer them new tests and treatments as they are rolled out, he added, while stressing it would be \"incredibly confidential and secure\".Johnson said that while it could be \"very daunting\" for people to find out their cancer risk, it meant the disease could be picked up as early as possible.The NHS National Inherited Cancer Predisposition Register follows a similar database for Lynch syndrome which saw more than 12,000 people offered routine preventative screening after they were identified as being at higher risk, according to the NHS.Charlie Grinstead, a 32-year-old diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2020, said his Lynch syndrome diagnosis gave him access to immunotherapy after unsuccessful chemotherapy - and proved to be the \"the key to my recovery\".Streeting said: \"One in every two people will get cancer in their lifetime but that does not mean the chances are random - many people face a higher risk through the genes they inherit.\"And while we cannot do anything about inherited genes, we can do something about what we do with that information.\"He said the \"world-leading genetic register\" would allow personalised and preventative care to be provided sooner.\"This register won't just supercharge innovation - it will be life changing and life-saving, allowing the NHS to develop individual care, fast-track screening and tailored information to enable more cancers to be caught earlier.\"Claire Rowney, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said the move would \"transform the lives of women who are at increased risk of breast cancer due to their family history or genetics\".She said it had to be accessible to all clinicians and designed to ensure those with an increased risk profile received \"joined-up care\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoKate WhannelPA MediaAndy Burnham has announced that he is seeking permission to stand in the upcoming Gorton and Denton parliamentary by-election.If he won and became an MP, Burnham could mount a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer but the BBC has been told that allies of the prime minister may try and block him from standing in the constituency. Burnham is currently mayor of Greater Manchester and in a statement insisted that he wants to back the Labour government \"not undermine it\", adding that the decision had been \"difficult\".The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after Andrew Gwynne stood down on Friday as an MP on health grounds.As a directly-elected mayor, Burnham has to get approval from Labour's ruling national executive committee before he can enter the race to be the party's candidate. That decision is expected on Sunday.Several Labour MPs have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Burnham could be blocked from standing in the by-election.Burnham had until Saturday afternoon to submit his application and on the dot of the 5pm deadline, he shared his letter to the NEC on social media, ending days of speculation over what he was planning. In his letter, Burnham said there was a \"direct threat to everything Greater Manchester has always been about from a brand of politics which seeks to pit people against each other\".\"I see this by-election as the frontline of that fight for the Manchester Way and I feel I owe it to a city which has given me so much to lead it from the front, despite the risks involved.\"He said he had left Westminster nearly a decade ago because he believed \"it wasn't working for people in our part of the world\" and that as mayor he had \"tried to pioneer a different way of doing things\".However, he added that he believed Manchester \"won't be able to be everything it should be without similar changes at a national level.\"This is why I feel the need to go back.\"There has been speculation that the prime minister could face a leadership challenge, after the May elections, which will see votes take place in the Welsh Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and in some local councils in England.Burnham has been touted as a possible leadership contender but can only mount a challenge if he is an MP in the Commons.In his letter to the NEC, Burnham insisted he would be in Parliament \"to support the work of the government, not undermine it\".\"I have passed this assurance on to the prime minister.\"Some senior Labour figures in the party have said they believe Burnham should be allowed to enter the contest. London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said: \"If Andy Burnham wants to be a member of Parliament, Andy Burnham should be allowed to be a member of Parliament\".Indicating her support for Burnham, deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell said the by-election would be \"difficult\" and that she wanted \"to make sure we are putting the best team out on the pitch week after week\".\"I don't want to see [Erling] Haaland on the bench\" in a reference to the Manchester City football player. She also said Labour members should \"get behind Keir Starmer\" adding that she did not want to see the by-election develop into \"in-fighting and talking about ourselves\".Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Burnham would be \"a massive asset\" in Parliament and that he hoped Gorton and Denton party members would have \"the option\" of selecting him as a candidate.Burnham's fate now lies in the hands of the officers on the NEC which include Starmer and Powell alongside Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, party chair Ellie Reeves and trade union representatives.A decision to turn down his application risks infuriating those MPs in Parliament who support the Greater Manchester mayor.Blackpool South MP Chris Webb said blocking Burnham would have \"serious lasting consequences\" adding: \"When you're 2-0 down at half time, you bring on the super sub to help the team win.\"East Hull MP Karl Turner said it would \"cause the most raving row\".If he were to be selected and won the Gorton and Denton seat, Burnham would have to resign as Greater Manchester mayor, triggering a new election for that role.Several Labour sources have said the NEC could block Burnham's application on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive for the party. It would also be costly for the taxpayer with the last mayoral election costing around £4.7m. The area of Gorton and Denton has traditionally voted Labour and the party won the seat in 2024 with a majority of 13,000.However, since then the party's popularity has declined and Labour could face challenges from Reform UK and the Green Party who came second and third at the general election.Shortly after, Burnham made his intentions clear, Reform's Lee Anderson posted a picture of himself campaigning in Gorton and Denton with the message \"bring it on\".",

Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

That was our Dakar over,\" Kirk said.However, the pair managed to get to the end without further issues despite not having spare tyres and the \"steering being out\".\"A lot of people thought we wouldn't get here. \"It's been awesome, all the support has just been out of this world. \"All the messages kept us going and it gave us a big push to the end,\" said Kirk.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Every police officer in England and Wales will be required to hold a licence to be able to continue working, the Home Office has said. They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their job, under the terms of a phased scheme similar to ones for lawyers or doctors. Some senior figures in policing fear the scheme will be \"expensive\" and \"time consuming,\" and could undermine vetting processes already in place. Under separate proposals announced on Friday, ministers will be granted new powers to dismiss chief constables and intervene in forces deemed to be failing. The plans are part of a raft of reforms expected from Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who is promising to oversee the biggest shake-up of policing in decades. Officers will have to renew what the Home Office calls a 'licence to practice' throughout their career by keeping up to date with latest methods and guidance. Training will be rolled out in phases. The aim is that the new standardised programme will be clearer to follow across all 43 police forces in England and Wales. \"Every police officer needs to remain match fit to protect their communities. As crime evolves, we expect police to evolve more quickly\", Crime and Policing Minister Sarah Jones said. \"The licence to practise will equip every officer with the skills and capabilities to do the job – whether new to the force or a policing veteran.\" But Matt Cane, general secretary of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he feared the licence would become \"an expensive, time-consuming, tick-box exercise\".He said that training was \"already inadequate\", and pointed out that police already carry warrant cards and go through vetting processes in order to practice. Last week it was announced the home secretary will be given new powers to sack police chiefs. On Friday, additional statutory powers were extended to ministers, who will be able to force the \"retirement, resignation, or suspension\" of police chief constables if they are performing poorly. Currently, only police and crime commissioners hold that power. Ministers will also be able to send in \"specialist teams\" to turn around forces if crime solving rates or police response times are poor.The government said that new targets on policing will also be introduced, and made available to the public. \"It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces,\" Mahmood said in a statement. It comes after Mahmood last week said she had lost confidence in West Midlands Police's chief constable Craig Guildford after Israeli football fans were banned from a match against Aston Villa. He later retired from the force. Sir Andy Cooke, who leads His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), welcomed the plans. The body independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces. \"Where a police force is failing the public, there must be a clear, fair system to make sure concerns are acted upon. The inspectorate is a vital part of that system,\" he said. \"These reforms will help make sure under-performance is more quickly addressed whilst supporting forces to respond to our recommendations more effectively, so that every community gets the policing it deserves.\"On Monday, as part of her reforms plan, the home secretary will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime.Reacting to news of the cuts, the Police Federation of England and Wales said: \"Policing's current structure has entrenched a postcode lottery in what the public see but also how officers are led, supported and treated.\"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"That body's largest branch, the Metropolitan Police Federation, also voiced its concerns about what is being proposed, saying: \"We all want the highest standards in policing but we fear this will be an expensive, time-consuming, tick-box exercise and become bureaucratic and burdensome\" on a service it says is \"already stretched\".",

    "body": "'I have to go home and tell my children it's not nice to lie'5 hours agoRebekah WilsonBBC News NI PA MediaRachel Duffy is the first female traitor to win the gameSpoiler warning: This article contains details about what happened in The Traitors final.\"I've to go home now and tell my children: 'By the way it's not nice to lie'.\"Nonetheless, lying as part of the hit BBC series The Traitors helped Newry woman Rachel Duffy last 12 episodes and become the only female traitor to win the show and take home £47,875. From a poker faces to genuine shock, Rachel's game face was on par to get her through some serious heat amongst fellow competitors. \"When it comes to a game... the competitive side comes out,\" she told BBC News NI. Faith in humanityRachel managed to deceive and conquer throughout the game with her right-hand man, fellow traitor and fellow winner Stephen, who was someone she trusted from the start. \"From the minute he dropped his hood… I thought aw he's lovely, really nice person. I felt relaxed,\" said Rachel. The element of the finale that struck the audience was more than likely the cliff-hanger of whether either traitor would betray each other to take home the £97,750 prize, or would they split it?But both stayed true to each other and restored our faith in humanity - by one promise, to never write each others names on the black slate at the round table.\"As we made our promise, I just fell in love with him in the castle. We have a really nice friendship.\"PA MediaRachel and Stephen were crowned the winners, splitting £95,750, after 12 episodes of treachery and deceptionWhy does she think she won?Apparently, it's playing the game Mafia, where a group of people are split into two groups, with one group being killers that can kill during a so-called 'night-phase' and the other group can debate and vote to eliminate a player during 'day-phase'.\"I played Mafia growing up... I played that for 15 years. I became very good at any game where I had to play a straight face.\" 'Lying is tiring'PA MediaRachel grew close bonds with some of the players, forming a particular friendship with Amanda, who was a faithfulRachel's fate was sealed in a small chest, after the round table had voted for her and James in a tie that led to sudden death, Rachel had one chance to stay in the game. By what some would say was luck, Rachel found herself in the final, to the dismay of anyone backing the faithfuls. \"I'm alright with that. I've 47 grand. I think I can take that one on the chin... I'll be alright.\"But Rachel said she did notice watching back that the lying was taking its toll. \"I can see watching the episodes… the bags under my eyes getting a little heavier.\"Rachel said she had to push the energy to stay in the game but finding the energy was \"exhausting\" as a traitor. \"You're lying to people you like…staying up late in the turret... we had less sleep than anyone else.\"Homecoming for the Newry traitor? Friends and family of Rachel watched the Traitors finale at the Canal Court in NewryRachel's family watched the Traitors finale biting their nails. She watched the video of her family's reaction: \"I cried my eyes out, it's lovely to have a lot of support.\"The filming of the season happened months ago but the secret had to be kept until the final moment of the show. \"They kept saying... just tell me tonight (before the finale). My brother... he had to go for a walk every round table and kept asking me what happened and I said 'but I can't tell you'.\"None of the cast knew the ending. None of my family knew the ending.\"Rachel woke up after the finale feeling like the weight of all those lies had been lifted. \"A sense of relief, it's been so many secrets. Forget the lies, it's the secrets, holding on to that... I feel lighter, I feel I've no secrets. No more lies!\"She laughed about how she'll have to be a hypocrite now:\"I've to go home now and tell my children by the way its not nice to lie.\"What will Rachel do with the money? When the last players got a chance to take down their cloaks, daggers and suspicions they had the opportunity to ask each other what they wanted to do if they won. For Rachel, it was all for her family and her mother in particular, who suffers from Parkinson's Disease and also dementia. \"I rang my mummy this morning… I can't wait to come home and give her a big hug and say what will we do? Anything you want lets go do it.. so yeah as long as I get to spoil my family that's all I care about.\"She (Rachel's mum) didn't get all the twists and the turns but she's enjoyed watching it. She's very proud.\"Rachel will spend the money on her family but before all that she said there's one thing she needs to do first. \"Sleep. I'm gonna put my feet up and relax… January has been crazy… I just want to get home. In February we can think about what we want to do with the money.\"",

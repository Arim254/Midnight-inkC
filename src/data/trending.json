    "body": "20 hours agoRuth CleggSenior health reporter BBCBack in the 1990s, Alan Reeves would regularly perform on stage, stripping off to thousands as a member of The Dreamboys. He was so sought after that he, along with his troupe of male dancers, popped up in the Spice Girls film, Spice World.The then 24-year-old was, by his own admission, \"a bit of a pin up\".But by the time Reeves was in his 30s, he found himself in a very different situation — his mood was low and his libido had virtually disappeared.\"I just didn't feel right,\" he says.Reeves, now aged 52, says his lack of a sex drive began to have a detrimental impact on his long-term relationship.\"We were going without sex for three, four months at a time. I just wasn't interested,\" he says.\"This kind of thing can cause couples to break up.\"Fragile Films/ Icon Entertainment International/ Polygram Filmed EntertainmentGeri Halliwell and Alan Reeves in the Spice Girls film, Spice WorldNow a fitness and lifestyle coach based in London, Reeves began testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and says it has given him his libido back, turning him \"from a grumpy old man\" to feeling like he's back in his 20s. It just \"felt phenomenal\" he says.And women too are turning to testosterone.Rachel Mason, a 37‑year‑old menopause blogger, says the hormone has been \"amazing\" for her energy levels, concentration, and libido.Prescriptions for testosterone have surged. The latest data from the NHS Business Authority, compiled by the Care Quality Commission, shows that prescribing rose by 135% between 2021 and 2024.This increase comes at a time when sex drive across the UK appears to be waning. According to the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which questions more than 10,000 people roughly each decade with new figures due out later this year, the frequency of sex has steadily declined.In 1990, people aged 16 to 44 reported having sex an average of five times a month. By 2000, that had dropped to four times, and by 2010, to three. The next set of results are due later this year, and researchers expect the downward trend to continue — though they do not point to a singular reason for the decline.Against this backdrop, a debate is gathering pace. Can boosting testosterone improve libido, or is much of the attention solely hype, profit, and placebo?Diminishing sex driveAlan Reeves' experience of declining libido is just one example of a trend researchers say is becoming increasingly common.\"Over the years, we have noticed a drop across every demographic,\" says Soazig Clifton, Natsal academic director.\"There are fewer cohabiting couples than there were in the 90s, for example, so that could help explain the reduction in sex drive, but even when we looked specifically at that group, there was a decrease.\"In fact, some of the steepest declines in sexual frequency were among older, married or cohabiting couples.Clifton says it is difficult to say conclusively why sex drive seems to be declining.\"No data we have so far can really tell us with any confidence why, as a population, we are no longer having sex as much,\" she says.There are several studies which try to understand the reason, highlighting that the digital world could be a major factor, making it harder to switch off, as well as offering more choices of things to do.Our stress levels are also generally higher than they were 30 years ago, which may be a factor, says Dr Ben Davis, a GP and sex therapist.\"People have so much going on,\" he explains, \"There's tech obviously, but there's also an increase in stress, depression, loneliness […] all of these will add to a reduction in sex drives.\"And there is another possibility that has generated lots of interest online and become big business —  that low testosterone levels could be having an impact on sex drive.\"Testosterone levels in men are definitely reducing,\" says Prof Geoffrey Hackett, consultant urologist and member of the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM).\"The rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes, the increasing number of people leading more sedentary lives — all of these reduce testosterone levels. And declining testosterone levels will be a factor in why our sex drive is diminishing.\"Several large-scale studies over the past 20 years which have measured levels in men, suggest that testosterone levels have dropped, but Hackett stresses that the picture is nuanced — having low testosterone does increase the likelihood of a low libido, but that does not mean that everyone with low testosterone will have a low sex drive.Despite this complexity, tube stations, bus stops and social media feeds are now festooned with adverts like: Low libido? Brain fog? Tired? Time to get a testosterone check! Has your man lost his spark? It might be his hormones!So, can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) really offer a cure‑all for low libido?Testosterone 'gave me my life back'Melissa Green has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. She says it not only gave \"her zest for life\" back – it saved her marriage.The 43-year-old says her low sex drive was having a huge impact on their relationship.Being perimenopausal, her GP had already prescribed her oestrogen and progesterone through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but Green says the GP would not test her testosterone levels, saying she did not need that extra hormone.The NHS says it follows guidance from the National Institute of Care Excellence which states that testosterone should only be considered for women following a trial of HRT and all other factors which explain low sexual desire have been excluded. Those with concerns should speak to their GP, they add.Eventually, Green went to a private clinic, had blood tests done, and was told her levels were low. After taking her results back to her GP, she now receives some testosterone on the NHS, and a small top up through a private prescription.\"It's given me my life back. In some ways, I feel like I'm back in my 20s,\" she says, \"I've got more energy, I feel sharper, and my sex drive has come back.\"Melissa GreenMelissa Green and her husband, MarcusWhile some are effusive about the impact testosterone has on libido, others say it has had less welcome effects.Cheryl O'Malley was on testosterone for a year. She says while it may have helped return some of the energy she had lost during the menopause, it also boosted her sex drive too much, and left her with feelings of intense rage.\"I was really horny. I wanted to have sex with my husband, but at the same time I hated him.\"That's when you know this is not a good place to be, this was not me, I felt out of control.\"Rachel Mason says when she posts about TRT she finds \"many women are so scared to start testosterone, they worry they will become manly, develop facial hair, lose themselves.\"Rachel Mason @raysecommunityRachel Mason says testosterone has been \"amazing\" for her Mason says she has a \"particularly hairy part\" of her wrist where she applies her testosterone gel on a daily basis, but that the benefits she gets from the hormone are worth it.Along with increased body hair, TRT can come with a range of other side effects. For women, the most common effects are excess hair growth, acne and weight gain, which are usually reversible with reduction in dosage or discontinuation. Alopecia and deepening of the voice are rare with testosterone replacement.For men, it can cause side effects such as weight gain, painful and prolonged erections, male pattern baldness and mood swings. It can also lead to lower sperm production which can impact fertility. There are treatments that can help, but medical advice is recommended.'It's a gravy train'Some NHS GPs and secondary care consultants have told the BBC that private clinics are profiteering by selling TRT as a quick fix to a complicated problem.Dr Paula Briggs, an NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health, describes it as a \"gravy train\" where people end up paying a lot of money for something they do not need.\"It's out of control,\" she says. \"The wellbeing industry has created this gap in the market they're using to their advantage.\"It's abusive.\"Private clinics, however, say they are improving people's lives by offering a service that the NHS is failing to provide.Jeff Foster, an NHS GP and medical director at Voy, a multi-million pound clinic specialising in men's health, says the private sector is filling a gap in care.\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone.\"TRT is offered via the NHS with most clinics functioning under either endocrinology or urology.Michael Kocsis has been offering TRT through his company, Balance My Hormones, since 2016. He says that he's seen demand grow \"exponentially\" over the past few years.Kocsis says some of his patients have gone through the NHS to be tested, and been told they do not have low levels of testosterone, so have decided to go private.\"Just because their level of testosterone might be a bit higher than the threshold set by the NHS, does not mean that TRT can't help them.\"It's not black and white, it's more nuanced than that.\"AFP via Getty Images\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone,\" says Jeff Foster, a medical director at VoyFor men, testosterone starts to decrease by around 1% from the age of 30 to 40. NHS advice states that this is a normal part of ageing and is unlikely to affect libido.Alan Reeves initially received TRT on the NHS. Two tests showed levels of 10nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) and 12nmol/L, and he was given a course of four injections, three weeks apart. But after his fourth treatment, Reeves was told it could no longer continue, \"without much of an explanation.\"\"I was back to square one,\" he explains. \"That's when I decided to go private.\"Alan Reeves @coachalreevesAlan Reeves is now a fitness and lifestyle coachSo, what is a healthy testosterone level for men? It differs depending on which organisation you ask and which study you read.Guidelines from the BSSM, which have been interpreted from major international studies, suggest that men with less than 12nmol/L, should be considered for TRT and will probably be showing symptoms of hypogonadism — a condition where the testes are not producing enough of this vital sex hormone.NHS guidance differs between trusts, but it states that a man with levels below 6 to 8nmol/L may have testosterone deficiency.For women, testosterone starts to decrease between the ages of 20 and 40 before it plateaus as they enter menopause. It's normal for levels to go down, but the question is how much that reduction has an impact on sex drive and overall wellbeing.There are tests available, but it's difficult to take accurate readings because, while testosterone is also vital for women, the amount needed is a lot less. And even if it is prescribed, it has to be given a \"off-label\" as there is currently no licensed treatments for women available on the NHS.More from InDepthBriggs is wary of the buzz around TRT. She says she has seen a huge surge in patients telling her they need testosterone because they feel low and not in the mood for sex anymore.\"They tell me they've done their research. Often that means they have seen the life changing impact this hormone has had on someone posting about it on social media.\"Just because it works for a celeb does not mean it works for the general population.\"She says GPs in her local area, Cheshire and Merseyside, are inundated with patients asking for testosterone checks. There are many, she says, that will leave with a TRT prescription, only to come back a few months later and say it's had very little impact.While it does help some people, she says, the proportion of those who say they need testosterone, and who will actually benefit from it, is small. Clinical evidence so far when it comes to women, suggests that TRT is only effective for treating those who are postmenopausal with low libido.Briggs says advertising by private clinics has \"blown everything out of proportion.\"\"I'm not against TRT when it's needed, what I am against is seeing it so over-promoted.\"GP Ben Davis also warns that TRT can have a placebo effect, leaving patients sometimes taking and paying for medication privately, that they do not need.Cheryl O'Malley has stopped taking testosterone. She says the intense anger and heightened sexual arousal she experienced during treatment have subsided, and her libido has returned to a level that feels comfortable for her.\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it,\" she says.'It's not a silver bullet'\"For some, medication can be really transformative,\" Davis says, but he adds that it is more than just handing out medication.\"GPs might not have time to discuss with a patient what is behind their low sex drive, could it be their relationship with their partner, could it be how they view themselves, could it be the sex they are currently having is longer turning them on?\"He says that there are so many factors that play into a low libido and testosterone is not the only answer.Cheryl O'Malley\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it [testosterone],\" says Cheryl O'Malley Alan Reeves, however, has been on TRT for seven years now and is prescribed testosterone by the private clinic, Balance My Hormones. He says his life has dramatically improved.\"My libido came back, so much so at first, I wanted sex every night for 10 nights.\"But now that's calmed down and I am just in a good place.\"Nonetheless, Reeves believes \"it is not a silver bullet\" and there is no point in taking testosterone without making other changes to your lifestyle.Otherwise, he says, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a \"clapped out car\".\"I walk… taller now, that's partly down to testosterone, partly down to me.\"Additional reporting: Nat WrightTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "39 minutes agoMax MatzaTwitter/@DeptofWarFootage posted by the Pentagon appears to show troops boarding the tankerThe US military has boarded a second oil tanker in the Indian Ocean, after tracking it from the Caribbean Sea where it was suspected of helping Venezuela avoid US sanctions. The boarding of the Panamanian-flagged Veronica III is the second such US interception in the Indian Ocean in the past week. It comes amid a US crackdown on sanctioned oil exports from Venezuela. \"Distance does not protect you,\" the Pentagon said in a statement, alongside video and photos which appear to show the US raid.At least seven oil tankers have been seized by the US since last year, as the Trump administration moves to control the supply of Venezuelan oil.The Pentagon statement on Sunday defined the operation as \"a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding\". The statement did not say whether the US had seized the vessel, or allowed it to continue.\"The vessel tried to defy President Trump's quarantine - hoping to slip away,\" the Pentagon statement said. \"We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.\"\"No other nation has the reach, endurance, or will to do this. International waters are not sanctuary. By land, air, or sea, we will find you and deliver justice.\"The Veronica III is currently under sanctions imposed by the US Treasury Department. According to monitoring group TankerTrackers.com, the Veronica III departed Venezuela on 3 January - the same day that the US captured Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro in a raid on his presidential compound in Caracas. The ship was carrying 1.9m barrels of crude oil at the time of departure, the group says, adding that it is believed to have been involved in the transport of Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil since 2023.Twitter/@DeptofWarIn December, US President Donald Trump said that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the Venezuelan government described as \"theft\".The US blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual.Loadings fell roughly by half in January to about 400,000 barrels per day, Matt Smith, head of US analysis at Kpler, told the BBC last month.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoel Gunter, in JerusalemandFiona NimoniGettyHamas and Israel have both repeatedly accused each other of breaching a ceasefire agreement Eleven people were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five. The Israel Defense Forces said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of the ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.Gaza's Civil Defence said 11 people had been killed in the strikes, while staff at the Al-Shifa hospital said a 12th person was killed in an exchange of gunfire, separate from the air strikes.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect. The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. The board, which is due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Sunday that members of the board had pledged $5bn (£3.6bn) to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.In a post on his Truth Social platform, he also repeated calls for Hamas to move forward with disarmament. Hamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state had been established.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes. Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme. However, Trump later said there was \"nothing definitive reached\" and that talks with Iran would continue. More on this story ",

    "body": "4 hours agoAsha PatelEast MidlandsBBCPolice said the man entered the water near the junction of Main Street and Ash Grove Lane in Egginton, DerbyshireA man has died after he entered a flooded brook during a police chase.Officers had been pursuing a vehicle towing a caravan, which was believed to have been stolen from the village of Oakerthorpe in Derbyshire, in the early hours of Saturday, Derbyshire Police said.The force said after ramming police cars and eventually coming to a stop near Egginton, two men fled the vehicle and one man was arrested, while the second man entered Egginton Brook - which was flooded.The man was recovered from the water after several hours and taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The force said it had referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).Damage has been caused to a wall on the bridge at the junction of Ash Grove Lane and Main Street Formal identification of the man who died has not yet taken place and the police said efforts were ongoing to trace his next of kin. He had entered the water near the junction of Main Street and Ash Grove Lane, according to the force, which led to \"extensive searches\" involving Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. The man was treated by ambulance crews at the scene before he was taken to hospital. BBC correspondent Jeremy Ball said from the scene: \"Smashed brickwork from the bridge over Egginton Brook lies in the water, below a broken 'Welcome to the village of Egginton' sign. \"One villager told me the road was closed until a wrecked car was removed from the bridge.\"Adrian Osiecki, 34, from Harnall Lane West in Coventry, has been charged with dangerous driving - including failing to stop for police and criminal damage to police vehicles - driving without insurance, driving while disqualified and theft of a caravan.He is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Monday.

    "body": "Gender pay gap won't close for another 30 years, warns trade unions group5 hours agoJosh MartinPA MediaThe gender pay gap is prominent even in industries where women make up the majority of employees, such as health and social careMoves to close the gender pay gap will not be successful until 2056 if progress remains at its current rate, according to the Trades Union Congress (TUC).The disparity between average wages for men and women is 12.8%, or £2,548 per year, according to TUC analysis of official pay data. It is widest in the finance and insurance industry, at 27.2%. In the leisure service sector it was only 1.5%.The gender pay gap measures the difference in salaries paid to men and women in the same industries. Employers with more than 250 UK staff must report pay data.The government said it was \"tackling the root causes of the gender pay gap and backing women to succeed at work\".Even in industries where woman make up a majority of the workforce, such as education and health and social care, the gender pay gaps are 17% and 12.8%, respectively.Pay disparity between genders meant that the average woman employee \"effectively works for 47 days of the year for free,\" the TUC said.\"Women have effectively been working for free for the first month and a half of the year compared to men,\" TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said.\"With the cost of living still biting hard, women simply can't afford to keep losing out. They deserve their fair share\".Nowak pointed to the recent Employment Rights Act as a \"an important step forward for pay parity\" but said the government needed to increase access to paid parental leave so \"mums and dads can better share care\".The gender pay gap is widest for workers aged 50-59, which the group of unions argues is partly due to the long-term effects of women pausing or reducing their career ambitions and pay to prioritise caring responsibilities.The TUC, the national federation of trade unions, wants improved access to flexible working and better access to childcare in order to help close the gap.Throughout the debate around increasing worker rights under the Employment Rights Act business groups argued that increased benefits and leave provisions would increase their costs and reduce their willingness to hire staff.\"The cost of doing business is already leading to firms cutting jobs. With major changes to employment laws coming down the line, the government must be extra careful not to add to those pressures,\" said Matthew Percival, the Future of Work and Skills Director at business group the CBI.Employers will soon have to publish plans for how they plan to reduce the gender pay gap.A government spokesperson said: \"Combined with changes to flexible working, stronger protections for expectant and new mothers, and wider action to review parental leave and to expand childcare entitlements, we are tackling the root causes of the gender pay gap and backing women to succeed at work.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersGerman Galushchenko (left) was among several figures in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government implicated in alleged corruptionA former energy minister in Ukraine has been detained while attempting to leave the country, authorities have said.German Galushchenko, who was forced out of his government role last year after being among officials named in a corruption scandal, was reportedly apprehended while on a train leaving Ukraine. It is unclear where he intended to travel to.He was one of several government figures implicated in an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scheme in November.The scandal threatened to engulf Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration, which swept to power before Russia's full-scale invasion on the promise to root out corruption.Zelensky's chief-of-staff Andriy Yermak - his closest adviser throughout the war - resigned after his home was searched. Neither the president nor Yermak have been accused of any wrongdoing.The scandal has, however, increased pressure from the US to hold elections, which have been suspended since the start of the war in 2022 due to provisions in Ukraine's constitution.The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) said in a statement on Sunday that its detectives had detained the former energy minister \"while crossing the state border\", as part of the Midas case.It did not name Galushchenko explicitly, but he has been named by several prominent Ukrainian media organisations.Galushchenko was briefly justice minister, a post he held when he was told by Zelensky to resign in November, having served as energy minister for three years prior to that. His successor, Svitlana Hrynchuk, also resigned after being implicated in the scandal.Nabu gave no further details on Galuschenko's detention, but said it would provide updates in due course.Radio Free Europe reports that he was being transported to Kyiv for further questioning, after border guards were told to alert the authorities if he attempted to flee.A massive anti-corruption probe, dubbed Operation Midas, was the culmination of 15 months of investigating, Nabu and Ukraine's other anti-corruption body, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap), said.They accused several people of orchestrating a scheme to embezzle money in Ukraine's energy sector, including at the national nuclear opertor Energoatom.Galuschenko was among those alleged to have systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Galushchenko previously said he would defend himself against the accusations.Former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was arrested in November on suspicion of \"illicit enrichment\", having already been charged with abuse of office. Timur Mindich, a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95, reportedly fled the country after he was flagged as a suspect. That the figures were accused of enriching themselves from Ukraine's energy sector caused particular outrage domestically, as the scandal broke as Russia stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of a bitterly cold winter.The former Soviet Union member has long been plagued by issues of corruption, which have continued despite Nabu and Sap operating for a decade.Cracking down on corruption is seen as a key requirement for Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBen King and Josh MartinBusiness reportersReutersAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor's time as trade envoy should be investigated for possible corruption, a former business secretary said.Files released by the US department of Justice appear to show the former prince forwarded UK government documents and other commercial information to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Speaking about reports of Andrew leaking sensitive information about the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Aston Martin while trade envoy, Sir Vince Cable, said his behaviour was \"totally unacceptable\".Andrew has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.Sir Vince, who was secretary of state for business and trade for some of the former duke's time as trade envoy, said: \"We need a police or DPP [director of public prosecutions] check on whether criminal corruption took place and a government investigation into how this was allowed to happen\".  In his role as a UK trade envoy - which ran from 2001 to 2011 - the then-Duke of York travelled globally and enjoyed privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.In 2010, he apparently passed on an email conversation about Aston Martin and the Royal Bank of Scotland to a contact, David Stern, who passed it on to disgraced financier Epstein.That conversation with Terence Allen, an investment banker based in Abu Dhabi, has some details of RBS's plans to restructure, and unflattering reflections on the chief executive, Stephen Hester.The email also describes \"conflicts between internal parties\" at Aston Martin.The BBC has contacted Stern for comment.It is not clear how much of this information came from his role as trade envoy. Andrew was a customer of RBS, and may have spoken to the management in that capacity, or in another.The bank was majority owned by the taxpayer at the time.Emails from a different source have also emerged suggesting he passed on information about Iceland from the Treasury to a banker contact of his, Jonathan Rowland.According to official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.Thames Valley Police on Wednesday said it had spoke with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about allegations that Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential reports from his role as the UK's trade envoy with Epstein.Labour MP and women and equalities committee chair Sarah Owens said Mountbatten-Windsor must face questions from police and Parliament, while her colleague Rachael Maskell told the BBC Mountbatten-Windsor had been \"conservative with the truth\".\"We need to know what was happening in those circles and therefore I think it would be right to be able to scrutinise, have transparency and to get to the bottom of all these dealings,\" Maskell said.Maskell said Andrew should also be stripped of his succession rights to the throne, as well as a councillor of state.\"All of these titles and positions need to be addressed so we're just left with Andrew the citizen and a citizen that is fully accountable,\" she said.",

    "body": "Just nowGetty ImagesEpibatidine, which can be secreted by Anthony's poison arrow frog onto its skin, was blamed for Alexei Navalny's death by five European nationsRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, the UK and some of its European allies have said.Traces of epibatidine were found in samples from Navalny's body and highly likely resulted in his death in a Siberian penal colony two years ago, the UK Foreign Office said.The allies said only the Russian state had the \"means, motive and opportunity\" to deploy this lethal toxin.The Kremlin dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", according to Tass news agency.What is the toxin?Epibatidine is a natural neurotoxin isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog, according to toxicology expert Jill Johnson.It was \"200 times more potent\" than morphine, she told BBC Russian.Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America as well as being manufactured in a laboratory.Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia, the European allies said in their statement.Species known as Anthony's poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog are among those that secrete the toxin onto their skin.Although epibatidine has been investigated as a painkiller and for relief from painful inflammatory lung conditions, it is not used clinically because of its toxicity.How does dart frog poison work?This powerful chemical compound acts on nicotinic receptors in the nervous system, according to Johnson.Because it overstimulates these nerve receptors, if dosed correctly, it can cause muscle twitching, paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and ultimately death, she explained.Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told PA that its effects can result in breathing being blocked, and that \"any person poisoned dies from suffocation\".The toxin being found in someone's blood \"suggests deliberate administration\", he added.Epibatidine toxicity can even be \"increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched\", Hay said.How rare is the toxin?Epibatidine is extremely rare and found in only one geographic region and only in trace amounts, Johnson said.It is understood the dart frog referred to by the UK Foreign Office and others was Anthony's poison arrow frog, a species endemic to Ecuador and Peru.The frogs produce the chemical through eating the right foods to produce alkaloids - a type of organic compound - that make epibatidine and accumulate it in their skin. If the frog's diet changes, its epibatidine reserves will be depleted.\"Finding a wild frog in the right place, eating exactly the food needed to produce the right alkaloids, is almost impossible... almost,\" Johnson said.\"This is an incredibly rare method of human poisoning. The only other cases of epibatidine poisoning I know of were laboratory-based and non-fatal.\"What has Russia said?European laboratories confirmed Navalny died from the obscure poison, the allies said on Saturday.Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, though Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was \"murdered\" by poisoning.The Russian embassy in London denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as \"feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists\" and \"necro-propaganda\".Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years and had latterly been transferred to an Arctic penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.",

    "body": "7 hours agoFiona NimoniandParham Ghobadi,BBC PersianAFP via Getty ImagesPolice in Munich estimated that 250,000 turned out to hear Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's former leader, give an addressHundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations around the world against the Iranian government on Saturday, following calls from the exiled son of the late shah for a \"global day of action\".Addressing an estimated 250,000 people in Munich, Reza Pahlavi - who has called for the overthrow of Iran's Islamic regime - denounced a crackdown on recent protests there.Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto saw the largest crowds, with smaller protests in cities including Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Sydney and London.Activists say more than 6,000 people were killed after joining nationwide protests in Iran against the rising cost of living and the government. Thousands more deaths are being investigated.Pahlavi told the crowd: \"My first message is to our brave and fighting compatriots inside the country: know that you are not alone, and today the world stands with you in this struggle.\"Criticising Iran's leadership, he said: \"In contrast to this corrupt, repressive, child-killing regime, you represent a great culture and civilisation, and in a free Iran of tomorrow you will prove to the world what a great nation we are.\"EPAReza Pahlavi and his wife Yasmine Pahlavi in Munich on Saturday Pahlavi's daughter, Noor Pahlavi, addressed a crowd in Los Angeles. The BBC's US partner CBS News reported her as saying Iranians had \"never been this close to freeing up themselves from this Islamic regime\". She called on US President Donald Trump to end ongoing nuclear talks with Iran's leadership, describing it as \"negotiation with murderers\". On Friday, Trump told reporters a change in Iran's government would be the \"best thing that could happen\", though it was unclear whether his comments were in reference to Pahlavi, who is seeking a role in Iran. Trump told news agency Reuters last month that Pahlavi seemed \"very nice\" but expressed uncertainty over whether he could muster enough support within Iran to eventually lead it.Andolu via Getty ImagesThe largest rally was held in Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 people turned out to protestLightRocket via Getty ImagesPeople gathered to protest across the world, including in LondonIn Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 joined a demonstration, participants told BBC Persian they were there to speak out on behalf of friends and family inside Iran.Street protests broke out in Iran on 28 December, initially sparked by economic turmoil and fuelled by long-running discontent with the country's leaders.Demonstrations spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 6,872 protesters, including more than 150 children.Many demonstrators in Iran have chanted Pahlavi's name and called for his return to political leadership.Groomed from birth to inherit the throne, Pahlavi was 18 years old when the 1979 Islamic revolution swept away his father's monarchy.Almost 50 years later, Pahlavi is once again seeking to shape his country's future.But critics question whether his vision for Iran would ultimately lead to a democracy.More on this story ",

Amazon said it was \"aware\" of the situation and was \"investigating\".Your SouthendThe route, said to be 600 years old covering six miles (10km), is managed by Qinetiq - a global defence and security company - which describes the area as a \"unique right of way which requires both caution and specialist knowledge to negotiate safely\". However, the route is not for vehicles, and people are advised to only walk there accompanied by a guide who knows the mudflats.According to parish council records, 100 people have died on The Broomway, with the last known death in 1919.Jodie Halford/BBCThe vehicle is expected to be removed from The Broomway on Sunday afternoonThe coastguard said it had spoken to a Qinetiq security officer who said the incident had taken place on Saturday evening and that the driver had \"removed themselves from the van and reported the incident to Amazon\". It said the vehicle had already been there during high tide and that, alongside a farmer, Amazon arranged to remove the vehicle on Sunday. Coastguard officers were stood down from the incident after the occupants of the van were confirmed to be safe and the vehicle was due to be removed. More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "'Fast-spreading' measles outbreak hits several schools in London5 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesHealth experts warn measles spreads very easily and can cause serious health complicationsAt least 34 children have been infected by a \"fast-spreading\" measles outbreak in several north London schools, health officials have said.The cases from Enfield were confirmed in laboratory tests in January, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported.A local GP surgery said one in five children who contracted the illness had been admitted to hospital, all of whom \"had not been fully immunised\".Families have been urged to ensure their children are up to date with their immunisations against the highly contagious disease, which can cause serious health complications.They are free.Enfield's NHS Ordnance Unity Centre For Health said on its website that there was a \"fast-spreading measles outbreak in several schools\" across the borough.It said infections had been confirmed in \"at least\" seven schools in Enfield and neighbouring Haringey.Enfield Councillor Alev Cazimoglu said the current outbreak had \"mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital\".She added: \"Vaccination is the most effective way to protect yourself and your family. We urge everyone who is not fully vaccinated to act now.\"Enfield Council said it was was working closely with the UKHSA, the NHS and local partners to limit further spread in accordance with national public health guidance.Dr Vanessa Saliba from the UKHSA said the \"big\" outbreak was \"mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries\".She said: \"Measles is a nasty illness for any child, but for some it can lead to long term complications and tragically death, but is so easily preventable with two doses of the MMRV [measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox] vaccine.\"Children who had missed doses should \"catch up as soon as possible\" to protect themselves and other children who are too young to be vaccinated or unable to do so for health reasons, she added.Dr Saliba also urged those travelling abroad over the Easter holidays to check their vaccination status because \"measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK, and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe\".Measles cases have been rising in the UK and in parts of the globe, with the increase blamed in part on poor uptake of the vaccine.In Enfield, UKHSA figures published last August showed that just 64.3% of five year olds had received both doses of the MMR vaccine in 2024/25 - one of the lowest rates in the country. Meanwhile across the UK as a whole, stats showed that 84.4% of children received two MMR doses by their fifth birthday. The recommended figure is 95%. The figure was 84.5% in 2023-24, down from a high of 88.8% reached in 2014-15.In January, the World Health Organization announced the UK had lost its measles elimination status following outbreaks in 2024.What is measles and what are the symptoms?Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes or by touching things that someone with measles has coughed or sneezed on.high feversore, red and watery eyescoughingsneezingSmall white spots may appear inside the mouth.A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically behind the ears and on the face, before spreading.The rash may be harder to detect on brown and black skin.",

    "body": "Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, Norway's king of cross-country skiing, became the Winter Olympics' outright most successful athlete with a record ninth gold medal.Klaebo led his nation to the top of the podium in the men's 4x7.5km relay - alongside team-mates Emil Iversen, Martin Loewstroem Nyenget and Einar Hedegart - for his fourth title of the Milan-Cortina Games.At 29 years old, it adds to the three golds he won in Pyeongchang in 2018 and two in Beijing four years later, while he is also a 15-time world champion.His medal haul could yet grow further, with two further opportunities for gold in the men's team sprint on Wednesday and 50km classic race on Saturday.In Sunday's relay, the Norwegian quartet won by a 22.2 second margin, with France and hosts Italy winning silver and bronze respectively.Klaebo said it was perfect to share his record-breaking moment in the team event.\"Being able to do that and take the ninth one with the team is special and it couldn't be a better way to do that,\" he said afterwards.He said being relaxed and enjoying himself is the key to his success, particularly at these Games.\"I've hit my right shape as well,\" he said.\"It was a little bit easier to prepare myself for these Olympics than the last Olympics, and the world championships last year.\"Having fun on the way is also important and I think it shows in the results.\"",

    "body": "'Trump will be gone in three years': Top Democrats try to reassure Europe5 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, in Mar-a-LagoEPAGavin Newsom, Democratic governor of California, told attendees that \"Donald Trump is temporary\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the centre of attention at the Munich Security Summit, as European leaders wondered apprehensively what tone he would strike in his remarks on Saturday. While his speech did not fully allay their concerns, it has been viewed as a reassurance to allies that while US relations may have frayed under Donald Trump, they will not break.Rubio's was not the only US political voice at the security summit, however. And even if the secretary of state's remarks had not been so well-received – if he had sharply criticised Europeans the way Vice-President JD Vance did at the conference last year – there were other US politicians doing their best impression of the Persian poet, counselling: \"This too shall pass.\"\"If there's nothing else I can communicate today,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a conference event on Friday, \"Donald Trump is temporary. He'll be gone in three years.\"Newsom was just one of dozens of American legislators and governors in attendance – including some Democrats, like the Californian, who may contend for their party's 2028 presidential nomination.ReutersNew York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the biggest attractions at the conferenceMany emphasised that the US would continue to be a strong partner with Europe – lines similar to those offered by Rubio, but unleavened by his criticism of cultural decline on the continent.\"The reason we're here is to provide reassurance that we understand how important our European allies are,\" Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said.A Republican in attendance, Senator Thom Tillis, echoed her, noting that the US and Europe were not in a \"civil war\". He cautioned American allies not to get caught up in the \"rhetoric of American politics\".That has been easier said than done recently, as Trump has imposed steep tariffs on many US trading partners, and he and some of his top aides have been blunt in their desire to reshape the international order, use American military power and refocus American foreign policy on the western hemisphere.The president's designs on Greenland – which he repeated before departing the White House for a weekend in Florida on Friday – have been only the most jarring example of the shift in the American outlook.Trump's willingness to push boundaries and test the limits of his power has not been limited to foreign affairs. And several Democrats took time in Munich to address more domestic concerns.Virginia Senator Mark Warner warned that the president's talk of nationalising elections and instituting stringent identity requirements for voting via executive order mean the freedom and fairness of November's midterm congressional elections are at stake.\"I never thought I would say that in 2026 America,\" he said.Trump has defended his effort – and the SAVE act, which would implement a national voter identification requirement legislatively – as both popular with a sizable majority of Americans and necessary to prevent voter impersonation at the ballot box.Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, who were the focus of a recent unsuccessful indictment attempt by the Department of Justice for their video urging US soldiers to disregard \"illegal\" orders, both commented on being in the administration's spotlight.The US, Slotkin said, was \"going through something profound\", before adding: \"We'll get through it.\"ReutersSenator Mark Kelly of Arizona spoke at the Munich Security ConferenceCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proved to be one of the biggest attractions at the conference beyond Rubio. She drew a line between growing wealth inequality – a focus of her domestic policy agenda since she won an upset victory in Congress in 2018 - and the rise of authoritarian governments.\"It is of the utmost urgency that we get our economic houses in order and deliver material gains for the working class,\" she said. \"Otherwise, we will fall into a more isolated world governed by authoritarians who also do not deliver to working people.\"Ocasio-Cortez was another of the Democrats who may have presidential ambitions. And while her appearance could build her foreign policy experience, it also underlined some of the risks associated with stepping out onto the international stage. At one point, she struggled to answer whether the US should defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.While Ocasio-Cortez comes from a different wing of the Democratic Party, her view about the need for Western democracies to provide a compelling alternative to authoritarian governments was similar to one expressed by Joe Biden during his presidency.Trump, with his \"America First\" foreign policy and talk of preserving Western culture, provided a decidedly different view of world affairs. And in 2024, a plurality of Americans voted to return Trump to the White House, setting off a tumultuous year in which Vance's confrontational Munich speech was just the scene-setter.While Rubio has smoothed over some rough edges, the Democrats who made the trip to Munich attempted to provide a more distinct counterpoint.\"Right now, Europe just wants us to be better, right? And I think this has been a very good conference to reassure nerves,\" Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego said. \"Sometimes you have to remind them that this is not all Trump... We're still here.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMarc Ashdown,Business correspondent andNick Edser,Business reporterA revamp of train timetables has come into effect across the country, involving some of the most significant changes for more than seven years.Rail operators are promising more services across the network and faster journeys on some routes as a result of the changes, with the East Coast Main Line to benefit the most.Passengers are being advised to check the new timetables before travelling.The level of change has not been seen since May 2018 when an update sparked major disruption and cancellations on some routes.Rail timetables are changed every May and December, but rarely to this degree.Network Rail is promising quicker journeys and thousands of extra seats every day, following a £4bn investment over the past decade.The changes promise a cut of 15 minutes to journey times between London King's Cross and Edinburgh, and 10 minutes between Edinburgh and York.Network Rail says the rail line, which is used by several operators, will have improved connectivity between Scotland, North East England, Yorkshire and London.One of the companies using the line, LNER, called the changes \"transformational\" and said it expected to run 10,000 additional services per year.Ellie Burrows, Eastern regional managing director for Network Rail, said: \"The industry has been preparing for many years for the new timetable.\"Our priority now is to continue working together to deliver the long-term benefits of this timetable change, the biggest in over a decade, for our passengers and the communities we serve.\"The changes will also see Northern launch a new hourly fast service between Leeds and Sheffield.Transport for Wales is introducing more services for Chester, Wrexham and Swansea.Another operator, Avanti, says there will be more trains between London and Liverpool.However, there will be cuts to some routes as well. Avanti is cutting the number of services between Blackpool and London from four to two.The changes are the biggest since May 2018 when a timetable update led to weeks of chaos on the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern networks.The number of trains cancelled each day by GTR and Northern hit up to 470 and 310 respectively.That led to a full review and eventually the Labour government's decision to create Great British Railways and bring the industry under state control.Travel expert Simon Calder said he was \"pretty confident we won't see the complete collapse of a network, as we did when the Thameslink line had its timetable completely reconfigured in 2018 - that was an absolute shambles\".\"There has been an awful lot of thought and time that has gone into this and the whole idea is to extract the maximum possible capacity from Britain's Victorian rail network without jeopardising reliability.\"Rail industry expert Tony Miles told the BBC's Broadcasting House programme that the changes in May 2018 had been based on \"using every available slot for a train on the network, and that was the mistake\".\"You need to have some wriggle room\" for when things go wrong, he added. However, Monday morning would be the \"real challenge\" for the new system, Mr  Miles said.\"Obviously Sunday morning services aren't quite as stressful for the system as a peak time on a weekday.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoWatch: Police release CCTV of Brown University shooting suspectRachel Muller-HeyndykA person of interest has been detained in connection with a US shooting at Brown University that left two people dead, police said.Nine others were injured when a gunman opened fire at the university in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.Police confirmed on Sunday a person had been detained, and an earlier order for people on the Brown campus and surrounding areas to shelter had been lifted.Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said seven people remained in stable condition, one of them was in critical but stable condition, and another was discharged.The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing on Saturday that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Paxson said that some areas of campus were still restricted as police continued their investigations. Around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, she said, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes, Paxson said. She added that the families of the two students killed were being supported. \"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" she said. Getty ImagesPolice had earlier released CCTV footage of a male suspect walking away from the scene wearing all black clothing. Officers said a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building.The suspect was arrested at a hotel overnight and taken to custody, a law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.They added that he is not currently enrolled as a student at Brown. Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez said the suspect was in his 30's but did not provide further details. Perez confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else and were working with prosecutors to collect evidence.Smiley said the city should be able to \"breathe a little easier\" after the shelter order was lifted. \"We have trained for this moment, but this is not something that any community should have to train for,\" he added. Hundreds of police officers and federal agents were sent to Providence on Saturday to find the suspect. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Saturday, President Donald Trump said the shooting was a \"terrible thing\". The attack on the Ivy League university brings the number of mass shootings to 389 in the US for this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.",

    "body": "King Charles has said he is \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack on Jewish people\" at a Hanukkah celebration in Australia.At least 11 people were killed in the shooting at Bondi Beach on Sunday and a further 29 taken to hospital, police said.The King said his and Queen Camilla's \"hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully\". He praised the \"spirit of community and love that shines so brightly in Australia\", adding that the light of the Hanukkah festival \"will always triumph over the darkness of such evil\".Rabbi Eli Schlanger, a British-born rabbi, was among those killed in the attack, his family has confirmed. The 41-year-old father of five was described as \"vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm, outgoing person\" by a cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis.He told the BBC people should \"spread light\" by doing charitable acts in Rabbi Schlanger's name: \"I know how he would have been reacting and it was something he said recently.\"Every human being on earth has a positive way to contribute to making the world a better place, and we just have to keep spreading light. The world is a positive place and we need to show that and I know Eli would be saying that.\"Sir Keir Starmer described the Bondi attack as \"sickening\" and said the government was working with Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish security organisation, on the policing of Hanukkah events in the UK.In a statement on X, the UK prime minister said: \"The United Kingdom will always stand with Australia and the Jewish community.\" The Prince and Princess of Wales have also issued a statement, saying their \"thoughts are with every Australian today,\" adding: \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives and stand with the Jewish community in grief.\"The Metropolitan Police has confirmed that it was increasing its \"police presence, carrying out additional community patrols and engaging with the Jewish community to understand what more we can do\".\"It is an awful reality that Jewish communities across the world continue to face a higher level of threat,\" the force said in a statement. \"At a time when London's Jewish communities are coming together to begin the celebration of Hanukkah, we know this attack will be the cause of not just terrible upset but also significant heightened concern about safety.\"In October, two people were killed in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.On Sunday, the UK's Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) called on the police and government to protect events celebrating Hanukkah which begins this evening and lasts for eight days.Hanukkah, also known as Chanukah, is a festival of light usually observed in December.\"We are devastated and angered that in Sydney, Jews appear to have been targeted once again for being Jewish,\" the JLC said in a statement.\"We know that such hatred also exists in this country, as we are still reeling from the attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur.\"As we prepare to celebrate Chanukah over the next eight nights, we call on government and law enforcement to work with our community to protect Jewish life in the UK and ensure that events this week can go ahead safely. We must not let hatred extinguish the festival of light.\"The mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the Met would increase its visibility in Jewish communities ahead of Hanukkah events, while Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government was working with CST on the policing of events across the UK.Police Scotland said it was carrying out additional patrols around synagogues and other Jewish venues and was \"actively communicating with faith leaders\".Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he was on his way to a Hanukkah event which \"should be a celebration but instead our community is once again mourning\".\"I will be thinking of everyone in Australia and those around the world in the Jewish Community who know this fear and loss. We stand with you.\"The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had offered its support to its Australian partners and was in touch with the government to discuss the UK response.\"The scourges of terrorism and antisemitism are shared, international challenges and need concerted and determined action to defeat them,\" it added.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has advised any British people caught up in the shooting to contact the Sydney consulate for support.",

    "body": "21 hours agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergNobody is expecting there to be a \"toilet police\" but everyone should \"follow the rules\" when guidance on single-sex spaces is released, the new head of the equality watchdog has told the BBC.Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said \"things could be sorted out if there is goodwill and recognition that everybody has rights\".The guidance, for businesses and services, was drawn up after a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in April that legally a woman should be defined by biological sex for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.The BBC interview, broadcast on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, is Dr Stephenson's first in her new role.The EHRC's guidance was passed to the government three months ago, but it has yet to publish it formally, which would give the code of practice legal force.It aims to provide advice to businesses and services - such as women's refuges, gyms, hospitals or shopping centres - about how the Supreme Court ruling should work.Seen by the BBC after it was leaked, the 300-page document says single-sex spaces should only be open to people of the same biological sex, otherwise they cease to be single-sex areas. That would mean, for instance, that a trans woman – a biological male who identifies as a woman - would not be able to use women's toilets and changing rooms.The guidance says it may be legitimate for businesses or services to ask people to provide confirmation they are of the eligible sex \"by proportionate means\".This has all caused controversy and anger among some transgender campaigners.Dr Stephenson told the BBC: \"Nobody is expecting there to be a toilet police. \"But equally if there are situations where there are complaints about regular problems, then people might need to... improve signage, improve explanations, or make sure they have got alternative provision.\"She said she expected both service providers and people using these services to \"follow the rules\". Dr Stephenson was challenged on what facilities trans people should use if there were no alternatives, or what businesses should do if they did not have the space or resources to make extra provision.She said: \"There's often unisex provision and where there isn't, as I say, we need to think more broadly about how we make sure those that those facilities are available…\"If you've got, you know, two self-contained cubicles, one of which is labelled men and one of which is labelled women, then the most sensible thing in those circumstances for a service provider to do is to make both of those unisex.\"Dr Stephenson was appointed to the role in July and she started earlier this month. It was greeted with hostility by some trans campaigners, in part because she had donated money to the case of lawyer Allison Bailey, who won part of a tribunal claim that she was discriminated against because of her gender-critical views.In our interview, Dr Stephenson was adamant she could still be objective when considering trans issues. She said she donated to the case because she was frustrated by situations where \"women were being harassed and losing their jobs on the basis of lawfully held beliefs\". She said she had been concerned by the experiences of some women \"when trying to have meetings to discuss proposed changes in the law\".\"I thought it was important that actually in a democracy, if there is a proposed change to the law, people should be able to meet and discuss those changes without violence or intimidation,\" she said.  \"If that's taking a side, it's taking a side on the side of kind of democratic norms and open discussion and dialogue.\"The full interview will be on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.

    "body": "Kemi Badenoch says the Conservatives will scrap the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles due to come into force in the UK if they win the next election.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Conservative Party leader said the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate (ZEV) was a \"well-meaning but ultimately destructive piece of legislation\".From 2030, all new cars will have to be electric or hybrid as part of government efforts to meet a legally binding aim of achieving \"net zero\" by 2050.The Conservative leader's comments come after her meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has lobbied the EU to water down its own plans for a ban.Net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere.Six EU countries, including Italy, have recently called on other member states to rethink plans to phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, saying it could hurt industrial competitiveness.Badenoch suggested the EU had signalled it would drop a full ban, adding: \"The reality is that the EU's change of heart on EVs will leave Labour even more isolated, and by pressing ahead alone, we are placing our domestic industry at a disadvantage while giving others the opportunity to dominate global supply chains.\"She said the only \"winners in this economic self-harm are China\".The Conservative leader added that her government would still move towards a \"transition to cleaner transport\" but one driven by \"affordability, practicality and technological progress\" rather than \"unrealistic mandates that weaken domestic manufacturing and empower foreign competitors\".She said scrapping the mandate would give \"space\" to rebuild the UK's car industry.UK car firms were said to have been split over the 2030 deadline, with some calling for more support to be able to meet it.In its latest Budget, the government announced an extra £1.3 billion investment into the UK's Electric Car Grant scheme to encourage drivers to make the switch to EVs.Chancellor Rachel Reeves also announced that drivers of battery electric cars, which includes plug-in hybrids, will be charged 3p per mile for the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty from April 2028, with some arguing the move could make electric cars less appealing.The ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars was originally introduced in 2020 by then Prime Minister, Conservative Boris Johnson - Badenoch, a cabinet member at the time, opposed the plans.It was later pushed back to 2035 by Rishi Sunak, with Labour pledging to bring it forward in its 2024 election manifesto.A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government remained \"committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales\".They said: \"More drivers than ever are choosing electric\".The next UK general election must be held by 15 August 2029, but the prime minister can opt to call an election at any point before this.",

    "body": "More than 700 migrants crossed the Channel on Saturday after a four-week gap in small boat crossings, according to the latest Home Office figures.The arrival in Dover of 737 migrants on 11 boats marked the end of the longest period without any small boat crossings in seven years.It brings the total number of people making the Channel crossing so far this year to 40,029, surpassing 2024, when there were 36,816 for the entire year.The last recorded arrivals before Saturday were on 14 November, marking the longest uninterrupted stretch since 2018.December is typically a quieter month for crossings due to adverse weather conditions and this is thought to have contributed to the lull. In recent months, the UK government has ramped up efforts to tackle small boat crossings but the measures are not expected to have an immediate impact.Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met ministers from other European nations last week to discuss reforms to the European Convention on Human Rights that would make it easier to deport illegal migrants.In November, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced asylum changes that include making refugee status in the UK temporary and subject to review every 30 months.The changes would also see refugees sent home if their country is deemed safe.The UK government's \"one in, one out\" agreement with France began in August and as of 27 November 2025, 153 people had been returned through the scheme.A Home Office spokesperson said previously the \"number of small boat crossings are shameful and the British people deserve better\".\"This government is taking action,\" they added. \"We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.\"",

    "body": "What we know so far about the Brown University shooting1 hour agoTom McArthurWatch: Police release CCTV of Brown University shooting suspectPolice have detained a person of interest in connection with a US shooting at Brown University that left two people dead and nine others injured. An earlier order for people on the Brown campus and surrounding areas to shelter in place has also been lifted.The attack on the campus brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 for this year, according to the independent analysis website Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.Here's what we know:What happened?The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.Final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting, the school said.The Barus and Holley engineering building is a seven-storey block that includes 117 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and three lecture halls.An economics professor told local public media outlet Ocean State Radio that the shooting had taken place during a review session for her course, which was led by her teaching assistant.\"He said that the shooter came in the doors, yelled something - he couldn't remember what he yelled - and started shooting,\" Rachel Friedberg said.\"Students started to scramble to try to get away from the shooter, trying to get lower down in the stadium seating, and people got shot,\" she added.On Saturday, investigators said they were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Mayor of Providence Brett Smiley said.Two students, who were studying in the nearby Rockefeller library when the active gunman alert came through, told the BBC they \"stayed away from the windows\" as they awaited a police escort.Officers searched the floor, made them drop their bags and raise their hands before before being led out of the library, the pair said.Brown University, one of the oldest higher education institutions in the US, is part of the Ivy League, a group of elite universities in the northeast of the country.The university, which has more than 11,000 students, is in Providence, Rhode Island's capital city, which is located about 50 miles (80km) from Boston and 180 miles (290km) from New York City.Who are the victims?Two students were killed in the incident and nine others were injured. Smiley told reporters on Sunday that one person is in a critical condition and seven others are in a stable condition in hospital. One person with less severe injuries was discharged, he added. The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.\"This is a day that we hoped never would come to our community. It is deeply devastating for all of us,\" she said in a statement.In a statement on Sunday, the university said that the families of the two students killed were being supported.\"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" Ms Paxson said.According to police, a ninth victim did not suffer a gunshot wound, but had non-life threatening injuries from fragments from a shooting \"that had occurred near them\".Who is the gunman?A person of interest was taken into custody in connection with the shooting, officials said on Sunday.Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said limited details would be released on the detained suspect, but said he was in his 30s. The suspect was arrested overnight in a hotel and is not currently enrolled as a student at Brown University, a law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS News. On Saturday police released CCTV footage of a male suspect, walking away from the scene of the shooting wearing all black clothing.There is no weapon visible in the video, and his face is covered. Officials also say a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building on Saturday.Some witnesses reportedly told officers he may have been wearing a camouflage grey mask.One person was arrested before police determined they were not involved in the shooting and released them.What is the latest?In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Ms Paxson said some areas of campus were still restricted as police continued their investigations.She said around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes. Brown University said all remaining exams, papers and projects would not take place as scheduled. US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters as he returned to the White House from attending the annual Army and Navy football game, described the shooting as \"a terrible thing\".\"All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt,\" he said.Additional reporting by Pratiksha Ghildial",

    "body": "Red post box sent to Antarctic - on King's orders7 hours agoHelen BurchellCambridgeshire BAS/Martin AllenThe post box will replace a handmade one currently used at the remote stationA shiny new red post box has been given as a gift from King Charles III to staff at a remote Antarctic research station.The Royal Mail lamp post box was sent to staff at the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey station at Rothera.The box, featuring the King Charles III cypher, was delivered after Kirsten Shaw, a station support assistant who runs the British Antarctic Territory Post Office for staff, requested an upgrade to their handmade box.\"Being in Antarctica is incredible, but it's full of extremes, so I think it's a special thing to send post back home, to communicate your experiences. It's a moment of your life that you put down on paper and give to someone else,\" she said.King shares personal message on cancer in TV broadcastThe Rothera research station, which opened in 1975, is the largest British Antarctic Survey (BAS) facility, and a renowned global hub for climatic research.It is situated 1,860km (1,155 miles) south of the Falkland Islands.Staff work and live at the station for months at a time. Ms Shaw said: \"Getting post is really special for the team at Rothera. \"If you're doing fieldwork for many months, the feeling of receiving a letter — an actual tangible, piece of paper with handwriting from friends and family — is such a lift. \"It's a wonderful way to connect people that goes beyond what an email or text message can do.\"BAS/Jake MartinKirsten Shaw and Aurelia Reichardt, station leader at Rothera, are pictured with the new post boxThe box will replace the handmade and painted one currently used at the station.The BAS said \"the Royal Household worked with Royal Mail to arrange this particularly special delivery\".It was delivered to Rothera by the UK's polar research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough, along with the first major drop of supplies to the station following the long Antarctic winter. The post box will be installed in the Discovery Building, a new scientific support and operations hub.BAS/Aurelia ReichardtThe handmade box will now be replaced by the official one from the Royal MailPostal logistics in such a remote area are understandably not straightforward.Ms Shaw's job is to oversee the formal Post Office logistics of getting mail in and out of Antarctica from Rothera, as well as getting post out to staff to other BAS stations and science field camps.Post has to be gathered and put on board the RRS Sir David Attenborough or on BAS aircraft to the Falkland Islands, where BAS maintains an office in Stanley.The final leg involves transport to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where letters enter the Royal Mail postal network for onward delivery.BAS/Jake MartinThe box will be placed in a new building at the stationJane Rumble, HM Commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory said: \"Maintaining a postal service in the British Antarctic Territory is far more than a symbolic gesture. \"It reinforces Britain's presence and heritage in Antarctica and provides a vital link to the wider world.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

Do the new Epstein files \"absolve\" Trump?AmericastAvailable for over a yearThe Department of Justice has said that their review process into files related to Jeffrey Epstein is over, after a new tranche was released on Friday.  Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "8 hours agoEmily HoltAngie EmeryAngie had a huge job tacking decades worth of family itemsWe all accumulate stuff over the years that can make our homes feel cluttered.But reclaiming the space with a clear out can feel overwhelming - it's hard to let go of items which hold sentimental value.Angie, Sarah, Susan and Jenni have all recently tackled the task and share their top tips for how they did it with BBC You and Yours.I got my daughter-in-law to helpAngie EmeryAngie and her daughter-in-law Louise who helped with the declutterAngie and her husband live in a large four bedroom house. Now contemplating downsizing, they wanted to tackle the clutter of things accumulated over decades with their two children, Katie and Simon.  Their children weren't keen to help but daughter-in-law Louise offered to step in.\"She was up for the challenge and it made it less stressful,\" says Angie. \"Decluttering brings back memories and it's hard but she made it fun.\"Louise says she was happy to help lighten the load. \"I love Angie and I wanted to help because I know the experience can be overwhelming and difficult.\"Another tip Angie shares is her technique of splitting clutter into small boxes which she tackled one at a time \"in a relaxed way\".\"I look at everything, is it rubbish? Has it got another life? Can I sell it? Should it go to the hospice?\" she says.Angie says she has got rid of hundreds of items by either selling on Vinted or donating. \"It can be such a lovely process to revisit things that you've had from your past and to be able to see it one last time before it goes.\" she says.I kept two boxes of sentimental itemsSarah ThompsonSarah and her husband Steve in their former home of the ShetlandsAuction enthusiast Sarah had bid her way to a big collection of ornaments and trinkets which filled her three-bedroom house in Shetland.She had two months to declutter before moving to a smaller house in Manchester and Sarah says putting a limit on items from each room helped.\"I made this deal with myself - you can have two boxes of sentimental items, things that you really don't want to get rid of and things that really mean something.\"She says she felt \"torn\" because she loved everything she had bought over the years but ended up making well over £100 selling her clutter. \"A lot of items were old or interesting and came with a story - I loved the enthusiasm of those buying what I sold,\" she says.\"We had various old vintage items, including an antique grain bin which was part of Shetland history, which we ending up selling to a pub on the island.\"Sarah was also able to donate to charity shops and says it felt great to move to Manchester for a fresh start without clutter. I took photos of everythingGetty ImagesSusan found taking pictures of things was the best way to keep the memory while losing the item.She did this with her ornaments, which she has donated to charity shops, and is planning to do the same thing with her physical photographs.Susan also has an abundance of cards dating all the way back to the year she got married in 1979.\"We kept all our special cards, so once a week, for an hour or two, I will scan cards in for a particular year and then [they will] always be there if I need them.\"She also reuses the old cards to make new ones and has let go of old cassettes and CDs.\"You can listen to stuff on YouTube,\" she says. \"We've only kept stuff that we can't get anymore.\"I decluttered one thing a dayJenni began her decluttering a few years ago by committing to throw away one thing every day.\"Some days I did more than one thing, some went to charity shops, some went in the bin, some went to the tip,\" she says.By practising this habit every day, she says she was able to train her brain to let go of things more easily, making decluttering a lot easier now than before she started.\"It wasn't overwhelming. If I'd said, 'I'm going to declutter the spare room', I think I would have had to go to bed for a week with shock, but because I thought, I will take one thing out of the spare room and get rid of it it was a method.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

The coastguard has not yet clarified the exact circumstances around the collision.

    "body": "3 hours agoKoh EweScreenshot/TaobaoTom Felton (pictured) is best known for his role in the Harry Potter seriesAn unlikely Lunar New Year mascot has popped up in China this year - Draco Malfoy. Tom Felton is best known for his role in the Harry Potter series, but now, the actor is also making an appearance in some Chinese houses, with e-commerce sites selling festive decor prominently featuring his face.His sudden popularity is thanks to his Chinese translation of his name Malfoy, Ma-er-fu. It contains the words for horse and fortune, ringing especially auspicious for the upcoming Year of the Horse.Harry Potter is hugely popular in China, with hundreds of millions of books sold. A re-release of the series' first film in 2020 grossed more than 90 million yuan ($13.6m; £9.4m) in three days. Ahead of Lunar New Year this month, Chinese households typically decorate their doors with couplets - a set of auspicious writings heralding health and prosperity in the new year. Others decorate their houses with fuzi - red square papers printed with the Chinese word for prosperity.The fuzi are commonly hung upside down to symbolise luck arriving in the household, as the Chinese word for upside down has the same pronunciation as the word for arrival.On Chinese social media, pictures show some users sticking couplets or upside down pictures of Malfoy's signature smirk.Merchants on e-commerce site Taobao are also seizing on the trend, coming up with  stickers and magnets featuring the Harry Potter character.Others began sharing photos of the character, saying: \"Share this image for good fortune\".\"[It's an] oriental new year with magical elements,\" one user on social media site Weibo commented. \"Felix Felicis!\" said one comment, a reference to a potion in the series that makes the drinker lucky for a period of time. Screenshot / TaobaoE-commerce merchants in China are selling Draco Malfoy-themed new year decorThe Malfoy themed Lunar New Year decor has even caught the eye of actor Felton, who reshared an Instagram story about his character becoming a \"symbol of Chinese New Year in China\".His acknowledgement sparked even more excitement on Chinese social media, with many fans praising him with the hashtag \"Malfoy himself is 100% hilarious\".The wizard franchise enjoys a fervent and huge fanbase in China - and Warner Bros Discovery has announced plans to open the largest Making Of Harry Potter studio tour in Shanghai in 2027.",

    "body": "12 hours agoChi Chi IzunduInvestigations correspondentGetty ImagesThames Valley Police says it is assessing allegations, reported by the BBC, that a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.The encounter allegedly occurred at the former prince's residence, Royal Lodge, in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.Her lawyer, Brad Edwards, has previously told BBC News: \"We're talking about at least one woman who was sent by Jeffrey Epstein over to Prince Andrew.\"The BBC asked Mountbatten-Windsor for comment about the allegations when it was first reported, but he is yet to respond, and has previously strongly denied any wrongdoing.In a statement, Thames Valley Police said it was \"aware of reports about a woman said to have been taken to an address in Windsor in 2010 for sexual purposes.\"We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.\"The statement added: \"We take any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously and encourage anyone with information to come forward.\"At this time, these allegations have not been reported to Thames Valley Police by either the lawyer or their client.\"The anti-monarchist campaign group Republic earlier said it had reported Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to the police over allegations that \"he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to the UK for sex\".Edwards, whose US law firm has been representing Epstein victims since 2008, said that after spending the night with Mountbatten-Windsor, the woman says she was given tea and a tour of Buckingham Palace.The Palace routinely records the names of tour guests, but it has not been possible for the BBC to corroborate the woman's visit without revealing her identity.Her account of spending the night at Royal Lodge is the first time an Epstein survivor has alleged a sexual encounter occurred at a royal residence.In 2014, the late Virginia Giuffre became the first woman to publicly accuse Mountbatten-Windsor of similar encounters.She alleged that as a 17-year-old she was trafficked by Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, and forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor - a claim he continues to deny.Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in the US against him in 2021, settling the case in February 2022 for an estimated £12m. She took her own life last year.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing growing criticism over his relationship with Epstein after the latest tranche of files related to the late sex offender.The documents released on Friday included pictures of him kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground, while other files repeatedly reference him. A number of exchanges between Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor came in the years after the US billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

A Tory amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill passed with 178 votes to 140, and comes just weeks after opposition peers supported legislation to ban under-16s in the UK from social media platforms.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has previously advised schools that they should be phone-free during school hours, but the guidance lacks legal force.Schools were first given directions on phone use in February 2024, but Phillipson argued it did not go far enough, and updated it last month. The education secretary wrote to heads to make it clear that all schools should be phone-free for the entire day, including breaktimes and lunchtimes.Pressing for the law change, Tory shadow education minister Baroness Barran said: \"We need to reset our own and our children's relationship with smartphones and social media, as smartphones are so often the gateway drug to social media.\"The flexibility inherent in the new guidance from the government is portrayed positively as giving schools and communities discretion to adopt an approach that suits them best, but the reality for many school heads is that it is the exercise of that discretion that's difficult, and it leaves schools facing off against pupils and parents.\"The changes made to the bill will be considered by MPs during the parliamentary tussle known as \"ping-pong\", which sees legislation move between the Commons and Lords until agreement on its wording is reached.As part of the updated guidance, Ofsted will be inspecting schools on the implementation of their mobile phone policies going forward, with the government advising teachers not to use their phones in front of pupils either.The recent debate around teenagers and phones has centred around two main areas: the place for phones in schools, and whether under-16s should be allowed on social media.There are concerns that moving towards a total ban on phone use in schools would bring more challenges.Speaking to the BBC, Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Many students need them for medical reasons, for travelling to and from school, and they are part of a daily life. \"So what we'd be asking for is a way in which that could be managed, and investment to allow schools to control those situations in a safe and appropriate way.\"But Charlotte Ashton, journalist and co-founder of Generation Focus, says she thinks a statutory ban is needed, to improve consistency between schools.\"What we need with a statutory ban is that every teacher to feel empowered and supported,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\"I struggle to concentrate with my phone in my pocket, let alone a 15-year-old who we're expecting to concentrate through maths.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesSir Brian Leveson pictured in his former role as Lord Justice Leveson in 2015The court system is \"on the brink of collapse\" as the backlogs for trials reach unprecedented levels, the head of a major review has said.Sir Brian Leveson, a senior retired judge, warned ministers, the police and others that there could not be a \"pick and mix\" response to solving the crisis.Last year, in the first stage of the review, Sir Brian called for the right to a jury trial to be scaled back and many intermediate crimes to be dealt with by a judge alone.His second and final report has recommended 130 efficiency changes, from technical measures to allowing prison vans to use bus lanes to hit court appearance deadlines.Sir Brian's two reports were commissioned by ministers as part of an attempt to reverse the backlogs that had reached record levels before Labour came into power, but have continued to worsen since then.Last September, the backlog of trials waiting to come to Crown Court in England and Wales was 79,619 cases, double the level seen before the pandemic.It is on track to hit 100,000 cases by November next year and some suspects being charged with offences today are already being told their cases won't be dealt with until 2030.That in turn has led to victims saying they are losing confidence in the system and walking away from the court process.The crisis has deep roots in cuts to spending on courts, judges and barristers. The impact of those decisions in the 2010s has been exacerbated by the pandemic, lawyers quitting criminal work over poor pay while the recruitment of extra police has led to more suspects being sent to court.Sir Brian said that his reports must not lead to a \"pick and mix job\"  but all agencies must act quickly.\"I have never seen pressure on the courts at such an unacceptable level - the system stands on the brink of collapse,\" he said.\"It is failing victims. It is failing witnesses, and on top of that, it's not even good for defendants who wish to challenge the allegations made against them, but whose lives are equally on hold waiting for the court date to appear.\"The one thing we do not have is the luxury of great time.\"Sir Brian's recommendations include appointing a dedicated criminal justice adviser working directly to the prime minister in the heart of government to oversee efficiency reforms to the courts, prisons, prosecutors and police.His 130 other recommendations include:Increasing the use of video remote hearings in courtsAllowing prison vans to use bus lanes to get defendants to courts on time - delays in delivering suspects from prisons is a huge daily problemCut the work police need to do to prepare a file for prosecutors at the start of a caseMore use of artificial intelligence tools to prepare cases and schedule themMaking better use of empty courtrooms - another daily problemSir Brian said ministers, the police, prosecutors and others could pick out some of his recommendations to act on immediately but stressed the entire system needed fixing.The Criminal Bar Association, representing barristers who work in crown and magistrates courts, reiterated its opposition to cuts to jury trials, saying there is no evidence that the proposed major constitutional reform would solve the crisis.Its leaders said local solutions in regional crown courts had shown that backlogs could be reduced and the government needed to learn lessons and fund more such programmes.\"[Sir Brian] has produced a full a MOT test report on the criminal justice system,\" said Riel Karmy-Jones KC and Andrew Thomas KC.\"His report is an 800 page list of failures and requirements for immediate action. Just like maintaining a car, you can't just fix one component and ignore the rest.\"If the MoJ and the Treasury do not act on this, the criminal justice system is going to end up on the scrapheap.\"Responding to the report, Deputy Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor David Lammy said the government would respond to the recommendations in the coming weeks.\"Efficiencies alone are not a silver bullet, but making the system more efficient and saving time across the board is a vital part of a wider package to tackle the problem of victims suffering for years for their cases to be heard,\" he said.\"We inherited a creaking justice system struggling with the burden of modern crime and using digital technology in order to make courts more efficient will be a central pillar of our approach to modernisation.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoBrian Wheeler,political reporterandAlex Partridge,political reporter Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson surprised everyone in 2008 when he arrived in Downing StreetPeter Mandelson's skills as a political operator were so highly prized by successive Labour prime ministers that they were apparently prepared to overlook past scandals to hand him a series of senior roles.Yet the release of emails by the US Department of Justice appear to show Mandelson himself was receiving advice on political strategy from US financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Crucially, Lord Mandelson appears to have kept Epstein informed of developments in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election, as Gordon Brown made a doomed attempt to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats.On 9 May, Lord Mandelson appears to tell Epstein: \"GB now having 'secret' talks with [Lib Dem leader Nick] Clegg in Foreign Office\".And then, at 09.07am on Monday 10 May, he appears to tell Epstein: \"Finally got him to go today\".Brown's resignation as Labour leader, it was later claimed, was the price demanded by Clegg to begin coalition talks with Labour.In the end, these talks went nowhere and Clegg formed a coalition government with David Cameron's Conservatives.Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment about these email exchanges, which appear to give an almost minute-by-minute account of the five days of coalition wrangling, which gripped the nation after there was no clear general election winner.On 8 May, two days after the election, while talks were taking place between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, an email appears to show Lord Mandelson telling Epstein he'd spent \"all day first with [Gordon Brown] then with Libs. They are all pretty bonkers…\"Epstein suggests \"stressing\" in negotiations that the Liberal Democrat plus Labour vote is \"15m v 10 million votes\".Later the same day, the financier suggests \"why not let tories govern with minority, no coalition\" suggesting they won't be able to get \"anything done\". It seems that Lord Mandelson, whose name and email address are redacted for most but not all of the messages, replies \"cos GB thinks British economy will collapse without [him] at helm\".Epstein also passed on advice from someone referred to as \"jess\" that \"supporting gb will be seen as bad form commercially, he has lost the confidence of the public\".He added that \"jpm\" [investment bank JP Morgan] is \"very concerned that the pound could be the next currency to falter. and big time. uncertainty is not in your favor\".At the time Greece was seeking a bailout from the EU amid its debt crisis.Lord Mandelson appears to reply \"agree but method and timing is all\" saying he's \"getting messages both from people saying to take GB out and keep him there to do deal with Libs. Ideally [should] do both. But cannot see how\".On 11 May, with negotiations still ongoing, Epstein tells Lord Mandelson \"a mere opposition party, is not in your interest\" to which Lord Mandelson seems to reply \"Not sure in my interest to father a mutual suicide pact\".Epstein then suggests making \"a real offer you can live with…if clegg won't agree, it would be on his shoulders\" and if he does \"youve bought time\".Hours later Epstein receives an email saying \"It's over. I am out of govt at the end of the day…\"Later the same day, as Lord Mandelson appears to say he is attending a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, Epstein offers a \"big hug\".The email exchanges are peppered with gossipy and sometimes indiscreet comments.On 6 May 2010, as UK voters went to the polls, Epstein asks his friend how it was going, to which Mandelson apparently replies \"we are praying for a hung parliament. Alternatively, a well hung young man\".'Third time lucky'Brown's decision to bring Lord Mandelson back into government, in October 2008, stunned Westminster.The pair had once been inseparable as they worked with Tony Blair to create New Labour.But Brown had never forgiven Lord Mandelson for what he saw as his betrayal in backing Blair for the party leadership in 1994.Explaining his decision to bring his bitter rival back into the fold as business secretary and a member of the House of Lords, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\"The appointment was seen as a daring gamble by Brown, whose government was floundering in the face of the biggest economic crisis in a generation.Lord Mandelson was a divisive figure who had twice been forced to resign from Tony Blair's government.Brown hoped that his old foe's political nous and experience as an EU trade commissioner would add much-needed heft to his government's handling of the global economic crisis.\"We are bringing together the best team possible to deal with the difficulties [that we face],\" Brown told reporters. Lord Mandelson acknowledged that the pair had had their \"ups and downs\" but said they were now \"joined at the hip\".As he bowled up Downing Street to start his new job, he joked to astonished reporters that it was \"third time lucky\".PA MediaGordon Brown turned to his old rival in his hour of needIn June 2009, Lord Mandelson's status was enhanced further when Brown gave him the honorary title first secretary of state, making him the de-facto deputy prime minister.In that same month, the DoJ emails suggest Lord Mandelson forwarded an internal memo on selling off government-held assets in order to raise public funds to Epstein.The Cabinet Office has referred material to the police after an initial review \"found that they contain likely market sensitive information surrounding the 2008 financial crash and official activities thereafter to stabilise the economy\".Part of Lord Mandelson's mystique - and one of the reasons he is despised by some in the Labour movement - is his love of political intrigue, gossip and plots.And this appears to be on full display in his alleged exchanges with Epstein.In early 2010, he appears to be discussing removing Brown as Labour leader or running for leader himself.On 6 February, he tells Epstein: \"If I continue as now people will say I am one of the few (only) big figures. And I have to deliver a reasonable campaign that only he [expletive]'s up. And that I perform well in the campaign itself. That I was bigger than the lot of them.\"Epstein allegedly replies: \"lets not dwell on him, i am only interested in how this plays out for you.\"Lord Mandelson allegedly says: \"Perhaps but either way - direct or not - he cannot take the truth. He needs 5 years of therapy...\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoPatrick JacksonEPAAn American private investigator has told the High Court he \"did unlawful stuff\" in relation to the Duke of Sussex for the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday - but could not \"recall what exactly\".Dan Portley-Hanks supplied a written statement that was given as evidence in support of the legal action being taken by Prince Harry and several other famous figures against the newspapers' publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL).Portley-Hanks said he had worked for ANL titles from the early 1990s until the early 2010s, and is now aged 79.Prince Harry is one of seven high-profile claimants accusing ANL of \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period. The publisher has denied wrongdoing.Other claimants in the case include Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. Both Sir Elton and Baroness Lawrence allege that they were the subjects of unlawful information gathering.Portley-Hanks, who started his statement by explaining he is commonly known as Detective Danno, said he had become a private investigator when he saw an advert offering full training in the profession, just a week after he had been released from prison in 1979.After setting up his own company, he was hired an as in-house private investigator for two US news shows. In the mid-1990s, because he was getting lots of calls from British newspapers, he set up a new enterprise as an \"independent supplier of data to British tabloid reporters\". He said he quickly got \"a lot of work\" from two Mail On Sunday journalists, Caroline Graham and Sharon Churcher.That paper and its sister title became his \"best client and the biggest payer\", he said, and Graham and Churcher \"frequently\" asked him to find phone numbers of people they wished to trace.\"I was the database guy. All I needed was a name or a phone number, and I could find a target's contact and other private details, usually within minutes,\" Portley-Hanks added.In his statement, he explained the work that he had done, on request by the paper, to acquire \"detailed information\" including phone records and contact between celebrity couples. They included Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton and singer Nicole Scherzinger, singer Jennifer Lopez and her then-partner Chris Judd, and singer Kylie Minogue and her then-boyfriend Olivier Martinez. Portley-Hanks' statement then named the corresponding Mail on Sunday headlines and articles that appeared in the newspaper within weeks of him providing his information.On Prince Harry, he said: \"I recall that I did stuff for the Mail On Sunday and Daily Mail in relation to Prince Harry. I know that I did unlawful stuff on him but I cannot recall what exactly.\"Churcher, he said, once asked him to send money to a former police officer, which was then used to pay a serving police officer for access to confidential files in relation to Jeffrey Epstein.Portley-Hanks said he had been asked to trace one of the paedophile financier's victims who, he discovered, was called \"Virginia\".At the end of his statement, Portley-Hanks said he was \"coming forward to do the right thing before I die\".\"The digging into the privacy of those people caused a lot of anguish in me.\"In response, Antony White KC, acting for ANL, said in written submissions that the publisher \"strongly\" denied that Prince Harry had been the subject of unlawful information gathering.White said there was an \"inability on the part of the claimants to evidence these so-called confessions\" by Portley-Hanks.\"What has emerged, and continues to emerge, through the drip feed of the claimants' disclosure and Associated's own investigations is a clear picture of purported evidence being obtained through financial inducements and threats,\" he said.\"No specific incidents\" of commissioning private investigators were alleged in relation to Graham, he added.As for the claim that \"corrupt payments\" had been made to a police officer, White said the documents had been sourced by Churcher from \"exhibits placed on the public record\" in civil proceedings involving Epstein.The incident \"provides no evidence of propensity to commission or use the product of unlawful information gathering\", the barrister said.The trial is expected to end in March, with a judgment in writing at a later date.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCAll the papers lead with the police investigation into Lord Peter Mandelson and former Prince Andrew's relocation from the Royal Lodge, all flowing from the fallout of the Epstein files revelations. \"Cops probe Mandelson\" is the Daily Star's headline, noting it comes \"hours after he quit the Lords\". In the lead up to Lord Mandelson's resignation, the prime minister \"had said he'd change the law to boot him out\", the paper reports. The BBC has contacted Lord Mandelson for comment and understands that his position is that he denies engaging in criminal behaviour.The Financial Times focuses on criminal allegations of \"misconduct in public office\" levelled against Lord Mandelson. The claims relate to emails released by the US Justice Department revealing correspondence between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Lord Mandelson. In these exchanges, \"sensitive details\" were allegedly passed on to the disgraced financier at the height of the global financial crisis, the paper says, when Lord Mandelson was UK business secretary.The criminal probe into Lord Mandelson is also the Times's top story. The paper notes that misconduct in public office, of which the former Labour grandee is accused, \"carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment\".\"Mandelson goes as Epstein crisis grows\" is the Metro's take, noting it could mark the end of the peer's \"47-year political career\". The paper reports Sir Keir Starmer told a Cabinet meeting that he was \"appalled\" by the \"gobsmacking\" revelations, adding that the former Labour minister \"let the country down\".\"He let his country down\", is the Independent's headline, quoting the prime minister, above a photo of Lord Mandelson.No 10 Downing Street has passed on a \"dossier to Met Police\" as part of its investigation, the i Paper says. It follows the Cabinet Office's assessment that Mandelson's emails to Epstein \"likely contained market sensitive information\" for the UK economy.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown \"goes to war with Government over Mandelson's leaked emails to Epstein\" leads the Daily Telegraph. The paper writes \"Brown has dragged Britain's most senior public servant into the Mandelson scandal, questioning why he failed to launch an investigation last autumn\". It also reports that Brown has passed on \"relevant\" information to the police about Lord Mandelson, who served as business secretary while Brown was PM. People close to Brown tell the BBC they object to the Daily Telegraph's headline, saying the former PM was \"in no ways... seeking to accuse No10 of a cover up in what he said in his statement\".\"Inexcusable\" is the Daily Mirror's splash, quoting Gordon Brown who describes Lord Mandelson's actions as \"inexcusable and unpatriotic\". The Daily Mail characterises Lord Mandelson as \"Labour's dark lord\", referring to his years accruing a reputation as a political fixer and \"spin doctor\". The paper adds that Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch \"piles pressure on PM\" over the Mandelson scandal.The Guardian leads with the \"Met investigation into Mandelson\", adding that the ex-business secretary has resigned from the House of Lords. The paper also reports investigators are looking into new allegations that Epstein \"provided Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with a woman to have sex with at the Royal Lodge in 2010\". While he has not responded directly to the most recent allegations, the former prince has always denied wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Sun reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"got the boot from Royal Lodge under cover of darkness\", writing that the eviction from Windsor came earlier than planned. The former prince is currently living at a temporary property on the Sandringham Estate. The Duke of Edinburgh's \"call 'to remember the victims' of evil Epstein\" leads the Daily Express. Prince Edward's intervention makes him the \"first royal to respond to the latest Epstein files release in which his brother Andrew features\", the paper writes. All of the papers lead on Lord Mandelson becoming the subject of a criminal investigation. The Times says he is expected to be interviewed under caution after being accused of passing market sensitive information to Jeffrey Epstein. The Daily Telegraph says the announcement means other senior figures from the New Labour era could also be questioned. The Guardian reports that detectives are also looking to request access to Lord Mandelson's devices. He has not responded to requests for comment about the allegations.Most of the papers also reflect on Peter Mandelson stepping down from the Lords. \"Good riddance\" says the Daily Star.The i's political editor, Hugo Gye, writes that there's \"no way back to public life\" now for the former Labour minister. The Daily Mirror highlights that No 10 says its asked officials to draft legislation to \"strip\" the New Labour architect of his title, which he currently retains.However, the Guardian argues that for Downing Street, Lord Mandelson risks \"being a headache that simply will not end\", as the focus shifts to how he was given the role of Britain's ambassador to the US last year. The Daily Telegraph says the issue is \"threatening to undermine Sir Keir Starmer's leadership\".The Sun has more details on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor moving out of Royal Lodge, after new revelations about his ties to Epstein. The paper says it happened under \"the cover of darkness\". He is also said to have been \"booted out\" earlier than planned. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing.The Daily Express focuses on Prince Edward, the brother of Mountbatten-Windsor, urging people to \"remember the victims\" of Epstein. He made the comments at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, after being asked by a reporter how he was \"coping\" with the fallout from the files.And finally, as filming gets under way for the Sir Sam Mendes Beatles movie, some of the papers carry photographs of London being made to look like New York, to recreate when the band appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. The Daily Mail says \"it would be easy to believe that Beatlemania was still alive and kicking\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate is optimistic he will be allowed to perform to music from the Minions films at the Winter Olympics after receiving copyright clearance from Universal Studios.Sabate, known for his flamboyant routines, has performed to songs from the Minions animated film series while wearing a yellow T-shirt and blue overalls, similar to the characters' outfits, throughout the 2025-26 season.He said on Monday that he would not be able to perform to the music at the Olympics as rights holders Universal Pictures had not given permission.However, on Tuesday Sabate said Universal Studios had reversed its objection and that he is \"so close\" to being allowed to perform his routine.The Milan-Cortina Games officially start on Friday, although the action starts on Wednesday.\"Huge thank you to everyone who reposted, shared and supported,\" Sabate said.\"Because of you, Universal Studios reconsidered and officially granted the rights for this one special occasion.\"There are still a couple of things to be tied up with the other two music of the program, but we are so close to accomplishing it! And it's all thanks to you.\"I'm so happy to see that the Minions hitting Olympic ice is becoming real again!\"The routine in Sabate's short program - the first of two routines in singles figure skating - has proved a hit in competitions, including in Sheffield at this year's  European Figure Skating Championships, where he finished 18th but became a fan favourite.Sabate, a six-time Spanish champion set to make his Olympic debut in Milan, said he followed all required procedures and submitted the music through the International Skating Union's (ISU) ClicknClear system in August.If he is unable to perform to the Minions mix, he may use music by the Bee Gees for his short program, as this was the routine he performed to in 2024-25. The men's event starts in Milan on Tuesday.\"As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate,\" read an ISU statement.\"Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoHarry LowHouse of CommonsBBCKatalin Kaszas says Mark Hehir helped her in a \"very, very scary\" situationA woman whose necklace was stolen by a bus passenger who was then knocked unconscious by the driver has said she is \"extremely grateful\" to him for intervening in what was a \"terrifying\" situation.Katalin Kaszas spoke to BBC London at Parliament earlier on Tuesday, where the driver Mark Hehir - who went on to be sacked over the June 2024 incident - had been invited by shadow justice minister Dr Kieran Mullan.Kaszas described how the thief snatched her necklace as she boarded the 206 bus in north-west London.Hehir, who left the bus to chase the thief, has previously explained that he struck him in an act of self-defence after the thief tried to hit him.'I was screaming'Hehir was dismissed by his employer, Metroline, for gross misconduct, a decision that went on to be upheld at an employment tribunal.Kaszas, who explained how the events unfolded, said she had initially thought the passenger was about to push her off the bus.The 46-year-old said she \"didn't even realise\" her necklace had been snatched from her neck until she looked down.\"Your brain doesn't catch up that quick. You're still trying to understand what's happened,\" Kaszas said.PA MediaKaszas says she is extremely grateful to Hehir, who now works as a barmanShe said after Hehir chased the thief and returned with her necklace, the man then came back towards her.\"I was screaming, telling him to stay away from me,\" Kaszas said, adding: \"His face was bad news. It was very, very scary at that point.\"Kaszas described how Hehir then stepped between her and the man. \"He kept the guy back,\" she said.She added: \"I'm a single mum. I'm the only one my daughter has. If something happens to me, it happens to her.\"He made me feel safe and since there is no Mark on the buses, I don't feel that safe any more because I know the next driver isn't going to step off the bus to protect me because he's going to lose his job.\"PA MediaKieran Mullan (left) introduced Hehir to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch in ParliamentCCTV evidence played at the tribunal showed the thief throwing a punch at Hehir.\"I noticed him making a left swing, so on instinct I retaliated with a right,\" the 62-year-old said.Both Hehir and the passenger were arrested over the altercation, which happened between Wembley and Maida Vale.Hehir, who is originally from County Limerick and now lives in Wembley, was later released and told he would not face further police action.The day after the incident, on 25 June 2024, Hehir was suspended from duty and told to attend an investigation. He was later dismissed. The subsequent employment tribunal heard from the Met Police, which said Hehir's response had been \"proportionate and necessary in the circumstances\".A Metroline spokesperson said: \"The Independent Employment Tribunal has upheld the dismissal as fair. \"The claimant breached protocols designed to keep staff and passengers safe, which is our priority.\"An online petition calling on Metroline to reverse its decision or compensate Hehir has received more than 125,000 signaturesMullan said he was \"shocked\" that Hehir ended up being sacked for \"stepping in\" to prevent a theft. \"That's not good for our society,\" he told BBC London. Justice Secretary David Lammy told the House of Commons on Tuesday that Hehir \"is of course a hero and deserves our support\".He added: \"I'm following this case very closely.\"As for Kaszas, who is from Neasden in north-west London, she said she felt guilty about what happened and had repeatedly apologised to Hehir following the tribunal ruling.\"I know it's not my fault,\" she said, \"but I still feel guilty because I'm in the middle of everything.\"More on this story",

    "body": "9 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesAt the Singapore Airshow, the exhibition halls are lined with scale models, mock cockpits, and interactive displays showing the latest commercial jets and aviation technology.One booth is drawing particular attention: Comac, China's state-owned planemaker, which has made significant strides since its C919 passenger jet flew to Singapore in its first trip outside of Chinese territory two years ago.The plane is designed to compete with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX and is increasingly targeting markets beyond China.In its own words \"Comac is setting sights on the Southeast Asian aviation market\".For the company, the airshow is a chance to position itself as a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing in Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, at a time when airlines are grappling with delivery delays and stretched supply chains.\"I think in time, Comac will be a global competitor... but it's going to take them time,\" Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) told the BBC.\"I think 10 years, 15 years from now, we'll be talking about Boeing, Airbus and Comac... But without question, they will be a considerable player in the future.\"Getty ImagesThe Singapore Airshow is an influential trade show in the Asia Pacific regionThere is certainly a need for another planemaker in Asia Pacific, analysts say.Airlines in the region are feeling the strain from delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, compounded by a shortage of engines and broader supply chain bottlenecks.Uncertainty over tariffs and trade tensions has further complicated challenges for the manufacturing sector, affecting procurement and growth strategy in the region.IATA data shows that global carriers are waiting longer than ever for new aircraft, pushing the average fleet age up and increasing operating costs because older planes are less fuel efficient.Walsh said that Asia Pacific airlines could see double digit growth in 2026 if planes were available. \"It's incredibly frustrating for airlines. The wait between making an order and taking delivery is about seven years,\" he said.This is why Comac is emerging as another option for many Asia Pacific airlines.The company says it has delivered more than 200 C909 and C919 jets, with around a quarter of those planes being operated by airlines in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam. Brunei's GallopAir has placed a large order for the firm's aircraft, and Cambodia is also planning to buy around 20 planes.\"We need more suppliers in the supply chain,\" said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). \"The problem with this industry is that the supply chain is an oligopoly and sometimes even a duopoly.\"\"We have been waiting for this for a long time. Comac is a welcome introduction. We need more suppliers in the Asia Pacific especially.\"The company is in a good position with strong government support, and lower prices can make its aircraft appealing to budget airlines in emerging markets.\"In the future we welcome all newcomers. We are keen to see more competition. Comac has got its certification process to go through and at some point in the 2030s, we see that it will be an offering that would be attractive to ourselves and other carriers,\" Mike Szucs, chief executive of low-cost Philippines carrier Cebu Pacific told the BBC.Getty ImagesAirbus is showcasing its flagship A350-1000 high-capacity, long haul passenger jetAs well as expanding in Asia Pacific, Comac is also pursuing European certification, with regulators conducting test flights on its C919. This would allow it to sell to European carriers.However, the road ahead remains long. European certification could take until 2028 or even 2031, regulators say. Meanwhile, harmonising a mix of Chinese and Western parts, flight controls, and software also presents technical challenges for international orders.Maintenance and repair infrastructure is another hurdle, as is pilot training - areas where manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have had infrastructure and systems set up for decades.And in Asia Pacific, Comac has some competition beyond Boeing and Airbus.Brazil's Embraer has carved out a foothold in the region with Singapore budget carrier Scoot, Virgin Australia and Japan's All Nippon Airlines (ANA) placing orders for Embraer jets.Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus still have a strong presence at the Singapore Airshow and the region as a whole. Both manufacturers are signalling to local carriers that aircraft delivery delays, which have frustrated airlines for years, are beginning to improve.\"We are pleased to say that we might be seeing light at the end of tunnel,\" Mike Szucs of Cebu Pacific said.There are questions about Comac's order numbers, too. It has previously said it has more than 1,000 C919 passenger plane orders to Chinese airlines, but only a dozen have been delivered so far. And verifying these order numbers is difficult as Comac is a state-owned Chinese company not a publicly listed one like Boeing or Airbus.Unless Comac can address some or all of these issues, Boeing and Airbus are likely to continue controlling the skies above Asia Pacific.",

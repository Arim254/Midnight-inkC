On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "6 hours agoHidayatullah,BBC Indonesian, Aceh, IndonesiaandKoh EweGetty ImagesA woman was crying during the public caning in AcehA couple in Indonesia has been caned 140 times for having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol because it violates Sharia, or Islamic religious law.The 21-year-old woman fainted after what authorities said was a record number of strokes to be meted out in a public caning session in the Aceh province.Three female officers took turns striking her with a rattan cane, while she cried. After she collapsed, she was carried off the stage by female officers to an ambulance.The couple were caned on Thursday along with four others, including an officer from the Islamic police force, who were all found guilty of violating Sharia. Caning is a common punishment for breaking Islamic law in religiously conservative Aceh, although the practice has long drawn criticism from rights groups who say it's cruel.Under Aceh's Islamic criminal code, sex outside marriage is punishable by 100 strokes of the cane, while consuming alcohol carries 40 strokes.Canings are not regulated properly, says Azharul Husna, the Aceh coordinator for Indonesian rights group Kontras, adding that the rules around such punishments should be \"improved\" to support people after they're caned.The officer from the Islamic police force was caned 23 times, as was his female partner, for being in close proximity in a private place.He was caught alone with her in her house, Muhammad Rizal, the head of Aceh's Islamic police force told BBC Indonesian, adding that the officer would be dismissed. Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia to enforce the Sharia, and punishes many of the offences with public canings. Additional reporting by Astudestra Ajengrastri",

    "body": "10 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentFamily handoutRoyal Artillery Gunner Jaysley Beck, originally from Oxen Park in Cumbria, was found dead in her barracks at Larkhill in Wiltshire after taking her own life in 2021Two serving British Army officers are to face a court martial over the handling of a case of sexual assault of the teenage soldier Jaysley Beck, who later took her own life.Gunner Jaysley Beck, 19, was found dead at her barracks at Larkhill camp in Wiltshire in 2021. She had complained she had been sexually assaulted. Last October, former Battery Sergeant Michael Webber was jailed for six months for sexual assault.An earlier inquest into her death heard the Army's handling of her complaint had played \"more than a minimal contributory part into her death\".The Army has already issued an apology, saying it was \"profoundly sorry\" for the failings identified at the inquest.The Service Prosecution Authority has now charged two officers in Beck's chain of command.The BBC has been told they are Major James Hook and Colonel Samantha Shepherd, who were both made aware of her complaint before she took her life. After the inquest, Beck's family had written to the head of the Army, General Sir Roly Walker, requesting that further action be taken against both officers.In a statement, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: \"Following an investigation by the Defence Serious Crime Command, we can confirm two individuals have been charged with offences under Section 19 of the Armed Forces Act (conduct prejudicial to good order and service discipline).\"It would be inappropriate to comment further as legal proceedings are ongoing.\"Beck's mother, Leighann McCready, said that \"more than 4 years on from the loss of our daughter we are very relieved to have finally got to this point.\"The MoD has set up a serious crime command and launched a violence against women and girls taskforce, and more recently has agreed in principle to remove the handling of serious complaints from the individual services.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "6 hours agoMalcolm PriorRural affairs producerPA MediaThere are thought to be approximately 21,000 tonnes of waste illegally dumped at the Oxfordshire siteTwo men have been arrested as part of an investigation into the dumping of thousands of tonnes of rubbish in a field in Oxfordshire.The Environment Agency (EA) said a 69-year-old man was arrested at a property in Andover, Hampshire, while a 54-year-old man has been arrested in Slough in connection with the massive pile of rubbish tipped near Kidlington.An EA spokeswoman told the BBC the arrests were for environmental and money laundering offences and were a \"vital step\" in ongoing investigations. Environment AgencyThe men were arrested in connection with money-laundering and environmental offencesBoth men have been released on bail.The dump in Kidlington, between the River Cherwell and the A34, is thought to contain approximately 21,000 tonnes of waste in a pile which is up to 150m (490ft) long and 6m (20ft) high.The mound of rubbish is made up of what appears to be processed domestic waste, shredded plastics, polystyrene, tyres and other household items.It is just one of 517 illegal dumps across England, at least 11 of which contain more than 20,000 tonnes of waste. They include a 280,000-tonne site in Cheshire, two 50,000-tonne sites in Lancashire and Cornwall and a 36,000-tonne tip in Kent.The total number of such larger sites is likely to be higher, as the Environment Agency has previously told the BBC it does not hold data on tonnage for every illegal tip.Most sites are in countryside locations, often hidden, and on what should be agricultural land.Police say many are run by organised crime gangs, who are making cash by charging much less than legitimate operators to take and bury waste.Businesses have to pay site fees to use legitimate licensed landfill sites, depending on the amount and type of waste they are trying to get rid of, and landfill tax is also charged at just over £126 per tonne.Community angerPreparation work to clear the Kidlington site started earlier this month amid concerns over the risk of fire and the impact that would have on the nearby A-road.A private waste clearance firm has been given the contract to deal with the site over the next 12 months at a cost of £9.6m.Emma Viner, enforcement and investigations manager for the EA's national environmental crime unit, told the BBC that the agency would be looking to recover the clearance costs under the Proceeds of Crime Act from anyone successfully prosecuted at the end of its ongoing investigation.She added that this week's arrests would help \"drive the investigation forward\" and allow the EA to \"follow more lines of inquiry to understand exactly what happened and who was involved\".\"The illegal dump at Kidlington was an atrocious and deliberate attack on our environment and the Environment Agency shares the community's anger at this horrific crime,\" she said.Environment secretary Emma Reynolds welcomed the arrests, adding: \"The illegal dumping of waste at Kidlington is appalling and has caused significant damage to the environment and distress to the local community.\"The government is committed to stamping out this type of criminality across the country, by boosting funds to tackle waste crime, hiring more officers and introducing tougher checks and penalties for those who break the law.\"The arrests were made on Thursday by officers from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) and follow an earlier arrest of a 39-year-old man from the Guildford area in November. He was released pending further enquiries.",

    "body": "Just nowChris Mason,Political editorandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterChina lifts sanctions on MPs and peers, PM Keir Starmer saysPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said China has lifted \"all restrictions\" on six current members of the British Parliament, after talks with President Xi Jinping.Speaking to the BBC in Shanghai, Sir Keir said a travel ban and other sanctions \"no longer apply\" to those parliamentarians, which includes four Conservative MPs and two peers in the House of Lords.The PM said the outcome \"vindicated\" his approach, suggesting his visit to China had \"provided the opportunity for a leader-to-leader discussion on sensitive issues\".But in a statement, the MPs and peers targeted said they did not want to be \"used as a bargaining chip\" and would rather remain sanctioned.The Chinese foreign ministry said: \"The two sides agreed in principle to resume normal exchanges between the legislatures of the two countries.\"China welcomes British parliamentarians who have the willingness to visit China more and experience the real China.\"China imposed the sanctions in 2021 and Conservative MPs Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani, Tom Tugendhat, Neil O'Brien, Tim Loughton - who is no longer in Parliament - were among those targeted.Labour peer Baroness Kennedy and crossbencher Lord Alton, who are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, were also sanctioned.They were banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China was frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions were prohibited from doing business with them.At the time, the then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said those sanctioned were \"shining a light\" on \"gross human rights violations\" in China.China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.The UK has not lifted sanctions on any Chinese individuals.It is not known if restrictions have been lifted on other people sanctioned by China, including Loughton who stood down at the general election in 2024.The lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the chair of the Uyghur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group, was also sanctioned, as was the  Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uyghurs.In a statement, the British parliamentarians targeted by China said they would \"rather remain under sanction indefinitely than have our status used as a bargaining chip to justify lifting sanctions on those officials responsible for the genocide in Xinjiang\".They added: \"We will not accept any reprieve that applies only to sitting lawmakers while others, including civil society organisations, remain sanctioned.\"Sir Keir's three-day trip to China - the first by a British prime minister since 2018 - is an attempt to thaw relations with the country, which is the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.The prime minister said the UK's relationship with China was in a \"good, strong place\" following his talks with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday.Downing Street regard the lifting of the sanctions as an example of what they call the \"clear wins\" they have secured on this trip.Sir Keir said he knew the sanctions on MPs and peers were \"a cause of concern, which is why I did raise it\".He said the lifting of those restrictions \"rather vindicates my approach because it's only because we're here that we have had the engagement and that has provided the opportunity for a leader-to-leader discussion on sensitive issues\".But there is disquiet among critics of China who argue the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.The Conservatives have accused Sir Keir of \"kowtowing\" to China and argued he should not have visited the country.US President Donald Trump has also criticised the UK's attempt to seek closer relations with China, telling reporters it was \"very dangerous\" to do business with the rival superpower.In response to Trump's remarks, Downing Street indicated that Washington had been aware of this trip and its objectives in advance.",

    "body": "11 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesOn paper, the job at a small PR agency looked ideal: a tight team, high-profile clients and the chance to build a fast-moving career.But what Maya (not her real name) had not anticipated was a \"toxic boss\" who set \"impossibly high standards\" and publicly berated staff who didn't meet them. \"She would regularly call people out in front of the whole team flinging insults like 'are you thick?' and 'this work is rubbish',\" she tells the BBC.Maya says her manager's behaviour often strayed way beyond performance management and into personal attacks.When a colleague said she had hired a personal trainer ahead of her wedding her boss left a photograph of a \"fat bride\" on her desk. A few months into the job, Maya realised that \"every single one of my colleagues would cry almost daily\". There was persistent sickness among the team \"due to poor mental health\", she says. Maya eventually left. Toxic or a personality clash?But, not every bad manager is toxic and understanding the difference matters, says Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute.Many leaders fall into what the institute calls the \"accidental manager\" category where people are promoted for technical skill rather than leadership ability. In those cases, poor behaviour is usually driven by inexperience or uncertainty, not intent.A toxic boss, she says, is different as \"they lack both empathy and often self-awareness\". \"They can actively undermine their team, take credit for others' work, or rule by fear and have unrealistic expectations,\" Francke explains. The impact goes beyond personality clashes, creating anxiety that can damage both mental health and performance.\"If you have a knot in your stomach on Monday morning, constantly cowering in corridors to avoid confrontation or if you are scared to speak up in meetings for fear of retribution, that is toxicity, not a personality clash,\" she says.Getty ImagesRachel McAdams stars in Send Help where she is stranded with her toxic bossJosie (not her real name) says she spent years working for a manager who kept her under constant surveillance.\"She would relentlessly call, text and voice-note me all day long, starting from 7am until 10pm at night,\" Josie tells the BBC. \"Even on days she wasn't working she wanted to know where you were at all times.\"She also took projects away from Josie and gave them to other people and excluded members of the team from group lunches.Hannah (not her real name) told the BBC she was regularly humiliated by her boss while working for a major supermarket chain.Once she arrived at a corporate event wearing the same jumper as one of the guests.\"My boss made me take my jumper off and work the event in my vest in November,\" she tells the BBC. \"I felt like such an idiot and it was humiliating.\"The tension between a toxic boss and one of their team members is explored in Send Help, a darkly comic survival thriller in which a manager and employee are forced to confront unresolved workplace tensions after becoming stranded together on a desert island following a plane crash.Speaking at the premiere, Rachel McAdams, who plays the hard done by employee, says she's experienced difficult workplaces and remembers a particularly bad boss at a summer job.“I just quit and my advice would be to quietly quit if you can and if not try and practise some zen.”Getty ImagesRicky Gervais played David Brent - the self-absorbed manager of Slough paper merchants Wernham HoggHow to deal with a toxic bossBut often quitting isn't an option until you can find another role. Francke says there are ways to manage the situation while you decide what comes next. She recommends: Tell someone: Find a mentor outside your reporting line who understands the organisation and can offer honest, independent advice.Challenge the behaviour: Don't ambush your boss but book a meeting and raise concerns calmly and formally with specific examples. If your colleagues are also affected, consider addressing it together to show the wider impact. Your boss might not realise the damage they are causing with their behaviour.Protect yourself: Set boundaries, prioritise wellbeing and create space outside work. It can be tough, but learning how to detach yourself from a situation will help you regain perspective and plan next steps.Use HR carefully: If your organisation has good HR you can certainly confide in them but it's worth checking whether they have a record of tackling bad behaviour rather than ignoring it.Know when to escalate: If behaviour is abusive or poses reputational risk, a formal whistleblowing process may be necessary but this can be harder to do for fear of retribution.

    "body": "Healthcare, visas and whisky: What did UK and China get from Starmer's visit?4 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesChina and the UK have called for a reset in economic relationsSir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic \"ice age\" that has defined their relationship.Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment.For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making.President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system.Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties.Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK.What deals were agreed?The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date.In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity.The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising.Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. \"Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity,\" he added.China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years.\"Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown,\" Sir Keir said. This is \"proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home\", he added.Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets.Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers.Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan.Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions.Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech.Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the \"potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world\".British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships.\"The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China,\" Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China.\"Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers.\"What challenges remain?Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency.These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies.\"Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice,\" Fitzgerald said.\"We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers.\"Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test.Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister.The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act.US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing.Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk.At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as \"very warm\" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs.These offer British firms \"really important access\" and are \"symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship\", he said. \"That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important.\"Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States.With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets.At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China.They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.",

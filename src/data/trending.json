    "body": "Robbie Williams: British people are good at devaluing ourselves5 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesAfter more than three decades in entertainment, Robbie Williams is back on the road and ready to celebrate.The singer, whose Long 90s tour begins this week, is taking a moment to mark his achievement. \"I think as British people we're very good at piercing the balloon of our own success and undercutting it and devaluing ourselves,\" he tells BBC News. \"It's what we do best. In many ways it's why we're great.\"But with this one, I really want to let it sink in and I really want to stand in the middle of it and go, 'OK, success, do your thing to me'.\"The tour will take in smaller venues, the kind he would have played at the start of his solo stardom. The 51-year-old says Britpop is the album he wanted to make when he first left Take That. It sees him collaborate with former bandmate Gary Barlow, Gaz Coombes from Supergrass and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.But he looks back at the Britpop era with mixed feelings - he experienced professional huge success, but was also deeply depressed. Getty ImagesRobbie pictured with Liam Gallagher at Glastonbury in 1995, at the height of BritpopHe recalls: \"I was going through my own mental illness and anything good that's happening to somebody that is in the throes of depression... they can't experience joy and there were lots of incredible things happening and I couldn't experience joy from any of it.\"But now I look back at it and think, what a decade. The last great decade for popular culture because everything since then has become quite vanilla.\"You don't know 2007 from 2023, but you know the '50s, you know the '60s, you know the '70s you know the '80s and you know the '90s and so I look back and with a wry smile and say that the '90s was an amazing time to have a bad time.\"Robbie has spoken openly about suffering from stage fright in the past, experiencing terror before walking on stage. He tells me that everything \"clicked into place\" for him when his first child, daughter Theodora, known as Teddy, who was born in 2012. \"The world started to make sense because I'd been running away from responsibility and I should have been running towards it. \"And when things stopped being about me and started to become about precious souls, I started to realise I've got the best job in the world.\"Getty ImagesRobbie with Ayda and eldest daughter Teddy, who was born in 2012Williams says he also feels much happier being back in the UK, after a torrid experience with the British press, particularly in the early stages of his solo career. \"I think that everybody knows, because we've seen it countless times, that if you are on the crest of a wave, the media comes to bring you down and attack you and malign you at every opportunity they can. And that is heavy and brings its own problems.\"But that was then, I'm in a different place now,\" he continues. \"I'm left alone just to put my songs out and be married. \"There isn't anybody at my door trying to get pictures of me 24 hours a day or trying to pop microphones and bug my house or trying to hack my phone. There isn't any of that stuff that's happening anymore. This is what I thought it would be like when I set out on my journey when I was 16, I'm having an amazing time.\"Williams, pictured with the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher, says he's glad social media was not around earlier in his careerOne thing the singer did not have deal with back then was social media, and he tells me he thinks it would have \"seen him off\". \"I get way too invested in finding the negative things, everybody does,\" he says. \"I wonder if there's something wired in us where we go, ‘let's find the problem, let's find a threat and then we'll negate the threat’.\"Then, of course, there is the eternal question, will Robbie ever rejoin Take That? The band that launched his career.Williams has spoken of them \"riding again\" and says he \"absolutely loved\" the documentary, adding that he had \"overwhelming feeling of how much I love the boys\".Getty ImagesTake That were recently the subject of a Netflix documentary, which examined their successOn February 13 it will be 30 years since Take That split (the first time), it's also Robbie's birthday. So what was he doing that day in 1996? \"Buying a Scalextric from Harrods,\" he laughs. Not the rock'n'roll answer I expected.After breaking a record held by The Beatles and winning more Brit Awards than anyone else, I ask Robbie what he wants to do next.\"I want to build hotels with my own venues in and then I want to play my own hotels,\" he replies.\"I want to do a university of entertainment and I've got the syllabus in my mind and it would be a great revenge on education for somebody that never left that left school with nothing higher than a D to go in and revolutionise education.\" Sign us up for the university of Robbie Williams. Britpop by Robbie Williams is out now. The Long 90s tour began earlier this week. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoKelly NgReutersTrump and Xi last met in October, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in South KoreaChina's leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in China-US relations during a phone call with US President Donald Trump  on Wednesday. Xi had told Trump to be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the island, state media reported, adding that he \"attaches great importance\" to ties with Washington and hoped both sides will find ways to resolve their differences.Trump cast the call as \"excellent\" and \"long and thorough\".Wednesday's call follows a flurry of visits by Western leaders, including UK's Keir Starmer, to China in recent months, hoping to reset relations with the world's second-largest economy.Trump himself is due to visit China in April, a trip he says he \"very much looks forward to\". He added that Beijing is considering buying 20 million tonnes of US soybeans, up from the current 12 million tonnes.\"The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post. The two leaders last spoke over the phone in November about a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to Trump and China's foreign ministry.Apart from Taiwan and soybeans, Trump and Xi also discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, the current situation in Iran, and China's purchase of oil and gas from the US in the call on Wednesday, the US president wrote.On Taiwan, Xi said the self-governed island was \"China's territory\" and that Beijing \"must safeguard [Taiwan's] sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\"The United States must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence,\" he warned, according to the state's Xinhua news agency.China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan's and is the island's biggest arms supplier.In December, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11bn (£8.2bn) to Taiwan, which included advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.Beijing said at the time that this \"attempt to support [Taiwan's] independence\" would only \"accelerate the push towards a dangerous and violent situation across the Taiwan Strait\".\"Just as the United States has its concerns, China for its part also has concerns,\" Xi told Trump on Wednesday.\"If the two sides work in the same direction in the spirit of equality, respect and mutual benefit, we can surely find ways to address each other's concerns,\" he said.Hours before his call with Trump, Xi held a virtual meeting with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, in which both hailed the strengthening of ties between Beijing and Moscow.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMatt TaylorLeicesterFacebookJon Ruben admitted drugging his wife Susan at Leicester Crown Court on WednesdayA man who laced sweets with tranquilliser and gave them to children at a summer camp before sexually assaulting them has admitted drugging his wife so she would not wake while the abuse took place.On Wednesday, the same court was told Ruben had admitted the offence of unlawfully and maliciously administering a noxious substance, temazepam, with intent to injure, aggrieve, or annoy, after giving a voluntary interview.Addressing the defendant, who was crying in the dock, Judge Timothy Spencer KC said \"you appear upset, unusually so\", adding that Friday - when Ruben is due to be sentenced - will be \"much more emotional\".The court heard the offence took place against his wife Susan between 26 and 29 July.While entering his guilty plea, Ruben tearfully said \"I'm so sorry\".NEMMEight children were taken from Stathern Lodge to hospital as a precaution in JulyIn November, prosecutors had set out how Ruben - who had run a holiday camp for children for at least 27 years - had played a game in which he would go into boys' rooms when they were getting ready for bed and ask them to eat sweets \"as quickly as they can\".Ruben had played this game with the boys \"for many years\", they said, and children had previously fallen ill the following morning.Mary Prior KC, prosecuting, previously told the court several of the youngsters found it difficult to walk, had slurred speech and could not wake up.The 17 charges admitted by Ruben were:One count of sexual assault of a child under 13One count of assault of a child under 13 by penetrationEight counts of cruelty to a person under 16 years, in relation to eight separate victimsOne count of acquiring or possession of dutiable goods, namely temazepam, by fraudulent intentThree counts of possession of a Class C drug, namely flubromazolam, diazepam and temazepamThree counts of making indecent photographs of childrenNEMMPolice had received a report of children feeling unwell at the summer campThe court heard at a previous hearing that Ruben's stepson raised concerns with his partner during the camp.A search of his stepfather's belongings uncovered items including baby oil, Vaseline and syringes, prompting him to notify police.Devices belonging to Ruben were later analysed by officers and found to contain more than 50 Category A indecent videos of children, the most serious category.There were also 22 Category B videos and seven Category C videos made between August 2023 and June last year.None of the images concerned relate to children who were at the summer camp.The owners and operators of Stathern Lodge are independent from those who use or hire the lodge were \"not connected to the incident\", Leicestershire Police have said.Before Ruben was sent to HMP Leicester, where he will remain until he is sentenced, Spencer said: \"I understand why you were upset earlier. I will sentence you on Friday.\"It will be a very tough day in your life and it will be a very long day.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

Officers were called to reports a man had collapsed in Oxford Street, close to the junction with Bonners Lane, just after 17:00 GMT on Tuesday.The victim, a man in his 20s, was taken to the Leicester Royal Infirmary but died a short time later, Leicestershire Police said. Prof Katie Normington, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University (DMU), said she was \"devastated by the tragic death of one of our students\". Leicester Media OnlineSeveral roads in the city were closed off following the fatal attackNormington added: \"Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. \"We are offering direct support to students, staff and the family of the victim.  \"We are working with Leicestershire Police as they investigate this tragic incident.\"Police said it believed the victim was involved in an altercation with another man in the street who left the scene.Officers will be carrying out inquiries in the area and have appealed for anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage to come forward.Tye Crofton said they heard a scream before seeing a man lying on the groundTye Crofton, a 19-year-old software engineer, said they saw the immediate aftermath of the incident unfold.They said they heard a scream not long before they finished work - but \"didn't think too much of it at the time\".\"Two or three minutes past five, as I exited the door, I saw a man lying on the ground covered with coats by around 12 or 17 bystanders,\" they said. Crofton said a person, who they believed was a member of the public, began performing CPR on the man.\"I didn't really know to react initially,\" they added.\"There was someone else there that had phones up to each ear, and I assumed that they were already on the phone to emergency services.\"PA MediaLeicestershire Police said there would be extra patrols in the area over the coming daysDet Insp Lorna Granville, senior investigating officer, said: \"We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported, as two men involved in a confrontation.\"One of the men is believed to have been stabbed and has then collapsed in the street. Despite the best efforts of medical staff he died in hospital.\"CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation.

    "body": "4 hours agoBBCMany of the papers focus on the political fallout from revelations about former Labour minister Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. \"Shaken PM abandons plans to withhold some documents detailing disgraced peer's appointment\" as UK ambassador to Washington, writes the Independent. A group of Labour MPs, including former deputy leader Angela Rayner, \"forced\" Sir Keir Starmer into a \"climbdown over the full release of vetting documents relating to Peter Mandelson's appointment\". Months after he stepped down from the post, UK police opened an investigation into whether Lord Mandelson passed on sensitive information to Epstein. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Metro reports the prime minister \"is facing a growing crisis over his leadership after admitting he knew of concerns at Lord Mandelson's long friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein – but still gave him a crucial government job.\" Headlining with \"liar, liar, pants on... hired!\", the paper refers to a photo appearing to show Lord Mandelson in his underwear, as revealed in a recent release of the Epstein files. Lord Mandelson has previously expressed regret for \"ever having known Epstein\". \"Rayner turns on Starmer\" is the Daily Telegraph's take on the pressure for the prime minister to reveal documents about Lord Mandelson's appointment. It writes \"Rayner and senior Labour MPs insisted No10 should not decide what material is published\" relating to the ex-ambassador's vetting.\"Starmer in grave peril\" writes the Daily Mail, which also focuses on the role of Angela Rayner in spearheading a \"revolt against his handling of the Peter Mandelson scandal\". The Guardian quotes Labour MPs who say \"it's over\" for Starmer's leadership. An unnamed MP who won their seat in 2024 tells the paper: \"The most terminal mood is among the super loyal.\"\"Sir Keir Starmer and his chief of staff (Morgan McSweeney) are fighting for their political futures\", according to the Times's top story. It follows Starmer telling the Commons that he and McSweeney were aware that Lord Mandelson stayed at Epstein's Manhattan apartment while he the American was \"in jail for child prostitution offences\".The i Paper also leads with \"Labour MPs losing confidence in the Prime Minister\" adding that \"allies acknowledge he's facing a sharp mood shift\". \"Revolting\" is the Sun's key takeaway as \"Epstein files outrage mounts\". The paper writes that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's staff at his new property on the Sandringham Estate \"refuse to serve him\", while the prime minister was also \"rocked by a Labour rebellion\". \"Ghislaine Maxwell email appears to say this photo of Andy Windsor with accuser Virginia Giuffre is real, and not faked,\" the Daily Star reports, next to a photo of Mountbatten-Windsor, Maxwell, and Guiffre. The former prince told the BBC in a 2019 interview the photo was doctored, saying he had been at a pizza express at the time. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied wrongdoing.Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports European spy officials \"believe two Russian space vehicles have intercepted communications with at least a dozen key satellites over the continent\". The paper writes the move \"risks compromising sensitive information\" as tensions deepen \"between the Kremlin and the west following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine\". \"Cancer patients will get personalised plans to help them cope with the psychological toll of their diagnosis\", the Daily Express reports, citing its own campaign for \"better mental health support for sufferers\".\"Snooker great John Virgo's widow paid tribute to her husband\", writes the Daily Mirror, reporting the \"legend\" of the cue sport died suddenly at 79.

    "body": "9 hours agoTiffany WertheimerRiccardo De Luca/Anadolu via Getty ImagesNow you see it, now you don't - one of the angels is left with no face at allThe face of an angel on a restored church fresco in Rome that sparked outrage because of its likeness to Italy's prime minister, has been crudely scrubbed out by the artist who painted it.Church and government officials launched an investigation after pictures of a cherub at the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina showed her newly restored face had an uncanny likeness to right-wing leader, Giorgia Meloni.The artist, Bruno Valentinetti, at first denied the claims, but on Wednesday he admitted that it was indeed the prime minister's face. He insisted that it was similar to the original, however.Valentinetti, 83, told la Repubblica that he was ordered to cover up the painting by the Vatican.The original facial features will now be restored, the office of the Diocese of Rome said on Wednesday, following a strongly worded statement from Rome's Cardinal Baldassare Reina.Expressing his \"disappointment over what happened\", Reina said \"images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited\".The Basilica of St Lawrence, which is a five minute walk from Meloni's office in the heart of Rome, has seen an influx of curious visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the now-infamous fresco.\"There was a procession of people who came to see it and take selfies, not to pray,\" the basilica's priest, Rev. Daniele Michelett, told Ansa news agency.Michelett said he had not noticed the resemblance to the prime minister when he first saw the restoration work, but agreed that it did not \"conform to the original iconography and sacred context\" of the church.Reuters/Getty ImagesGiorgia Meloni responded in a post on Instagram saying she was \"definitely not like an angel\", accompanied by a laughing emojiThe Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina is one of Rome's oldest churches and features artwork by Baroque masters Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Guido Reni.However the fresco at the centre of this controversy was not old - it was painted in 2000 and was not heritage protected. The wall painting is located in a chapel dedicated to Italy's last king, Umberto II, and shows the cherub holding a map of Italy.Bruno Valentinetti was the original artist, and had been asked to restore the artwork after water damage, Micheletti said.The government agency in charge of preserving Rome's cultural sites has now informed the church that any further restoration work will require authorisation and a sketch of the proposed image.The BBC has contacted the Vatican for comment.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentBBCA BBC investigation found asylum seekers in hotels were taking taxi journeys costing hundreds of poundsA ban on asylum seekers using taxis to attend medical appointments has come into force.The government changed the policy after a BBC investigation which showed people travelling long distances at high cost.In one case, an asylum seeker said he went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.The ban will not stop the use of taxis completely and there will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs.These cases will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.Taxis can also still be used for other reasons - such as travelling between accommodation. The Home Office is continuing to review that situation.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I have ended the wasteful use of taxis for medical appointments to protect the taxpayer's purse.\"I will stop at nothing to remove the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britian to restore order and control to our borders.\"It was revealed in November that an average of £15.8m had been spent a year on taxis for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used.One driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south-east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys.He said that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away.Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton \"more than once\", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car.He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted.\"I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,\" he said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentEPAInterest rates are expected to remain on hold as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets for the first time this year.The Bank rate is the primary tool for the committee to try to keep inflation - which charts the annual rate of rising prices - as close to 2% as possible.It heavily influences the interest charged by lenders for loans and mortgages, and what banks and building societies give in returns to savers.The majority of analysts are predicting the MPC keeps the Bank rate on hold at 3.75% when it announces its latest decision at 12:00 GMT on Thursday.Inflation remains above target at 3.4%, according to the latest data for the year to December.The nine-member committee only narrowly voted for a cut in December and gave a fairly cautious view of the situation.Analysts say there has been little data so far this year to change the balance between persistent inflation and weak economic growth.There is also an expectation that the Bank will be vague about when or by how much it will cut the Bank rate during the year as it awaits a clearer picture on inflation.Some analysts are suggesting one rate cut during 2026, while others believe the MPC could decide on two cuts.How rates affect your financesAround a third of households have a mortgage. Of those, about one million have tracker or variable mortgages that tend to change when the Bank rate changes.The vast majority of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments are not immediately affected by a rate change, future deals can be.Fixed mortgage rates, for those renewing or signing up to a new deal, fell at the start of the year as lenders competed for customers.However, broader pressures faced by lenders have shown signs of going up, with commentators saying that could stall any further cuts.The Bank rate cut in December and conditions thereafter have led to cuts in the interest paid by savings account providers to their customers.Rachel Springall, from financial information service Moneyfacts, said: \"The slaughter of savings rates will sadden hard-pressed savers. Since the start of this year, more than two-thirds (70%) of savings providers have cut their rates. \"As inflation remains well above target, real returns on cash savings are weak and this can lead to a dangerous attitude of apathy.\"The MPC has eight meetings a year and, after the latest meeting, it will also publish its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, which sets out its economic analysis and projections on which it bases its decision.",

    "body": "11 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesRyan Routh was taken into custody shortly after being fired upon by a Secret Service agent during the incident in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ryan Routh has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in September of 2024. Routh, 59, was found guilty last year of trying to kill Trump, then still a presidential candidate, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A US Secret Service agent in the area spotted a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes and fired at Routh, who then fled the scene. He was arrested nearby. In a sentencing memorandum, Judge Aileen Cannon said Routh's crimes \"undeniably warrant a life sentence\".\"[H]e took steps over the course of months to assassinate a major Presidential candidate, demonstrated the will to kill anybody in the way, and has since expressed neither regret nor remorse to his victims,\" she wrote. Routh's lawyer, Martin Ross, said they would be appealing the case. Routh pleaded not guilty and elected to represent himself during the trial, which began on 8 September. A native of North Carolina who lived in Hawaii prior to his arrest, Routh repeatedly acted erratically during the court proceedings, including challenging Trump to a game of golf and making references to Adolf Hitler and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After a jury found him guilty, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before US marshals quickly escorted him out of the courtroom. While Routh is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point during the incident, federal agents told jurors they later recovered a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and an extended magazine in the spot where he had been hiding. Additionally, jurors were told that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was likely to appear, as well as a note for a friend which described the incident as \"an assassination attempt\". In his closing statement during the trial, Routh spoke in the third person and touched on a wide variety of unrelated topics, including US history, the Russia-Ukraine war and his intention to buy a boat - prompting the judge to repeatedly interrupt him and send the jury away. The lead prosecutor in the case, John Shipley, said that a \"mountain of evidence\" was presented which points to \"how close he got to actually pulling this off\". The incident in Florida was the second attempt on Trump's life in 2024, after a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. That shooting left one person dead and several wounded, including Trump. The shooter, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was killed by officers at the scene. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandRianna Croxford,Investigations correspondentUnited States District Court Southern District of New YorkPeter Mandelson's friendship with Jeffery Epstein was known before he became US ambassadorPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said Peter Mandelson misled him about the extent of his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before he was appointed US ambassador.Emails released by the US Department of Justice illustrate the depth of that friendship and appear to confirm that it continued, and even flourished, after Epstein's 2008 conviction.In April 2009, while Epstein was still serving a prison sentence, he messages Lord Mandelson to say: \"ahh... here we go again\".A few minutes later, Lord Mandelson picks up his Blackberry and replies: \"Meaning? At least I am not involved.\"Epstein replies: \"Your romantic complexities\".On the day Epstein is released from jail, in July 2009, the two friends appear to have been in a jubilant mood.\"Free and home,\" Epstein emails the then Labour peer at 08.37am on 22 July.\"How shall we celebrate?\" writes back Lord Mandelson, who at the time was business secretary under Gordon Brown.\"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers),\" Epstein replies.\"From now on, grace and modesty sd [should] be discovered in London,\" Lord Mandelson appears to joke back a few hours later, before adding: \"How is freedom feeling?\"\"She feels fresh, firm and creamy,\" Epstein says.Lord Mandelson responds with two words: \"Naughty boy.\"The tone of the messages from this time is often jokey and indiscreet, occasionally veering into excruciatingly frank.They also suggest that the pair were in frequent phone contact in addition to emails, with one or the other saying \"call me\".The veteran Labour politician appears to have valued his wealthy friend's advice and support, on his political career as well as his private life.When Lord Mandelson tells Epstein he is out of government in May 2010, and is at Labour Party headquarters for a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, the disgraced financier offers a \"big hug\".Lord Mandelson jokingly replies \"you won't leave me will you?\"In November 2009, the pair are discussing pressure on Gordon Brown to resign as prime minister.\"What does tony [sic] say?\" Epstein emails, in what appears to be a reference to Sir Tony Blair, the previous prime minister.\"Talking to him tonight but he has said I sd [should] facilitate not initiate,\" Lord Mandelson writes back.Epstein responds, \"tell gb [Gordon Brown] you see the winds blowing and you are loyal, first second and third […] I don't suggest you tell him to step down…tell him you are his friend and am frustrated as much as he\".\"He will immed[iately] push panic button,\" replies Lord Mandelson.\"He would be stressed not knowing what you really think,\" Epstein responds, before emailing a bawdy joke about Lord Mandelson's judgement.\"Are you sure the backpressure from you[sic] lack of sex is not turning your brain into fois gras,\" Epstein writes.\"It's certainly a serious problem,\" Lord Mandelson seems to joke back. \"Cure coming to London from S'hai [Shanghai] next weekend.\"After his departure from government in May 2010, Lord Mandelson seeks Epstein's opinion on a draft of his memoir, The Third Man, which chronicles his role in New Labour's rise to power and his relationships with Brown and Blair.Epstein seems to be concerned about the impact the book could have on Lord Mandelson's future business plans, which are the subject of several other exchanges.\"I have finished my first read […] The deals you want to be involved in require discretion, trust, handshakes, privacy. This book announces that you are willing to sell all of these for a farthing,\" Epstein wrote as part of an email exchange dated 16 May 2010.\"Your friend, and boss, tony [sic], is more often described as frail, flustered, tired, weak, and Gordon, flawed, demanding, pig-headed, irrationally determined.\"Epstein adds: \"It is not uplifting, it is gossipy and defensive,\" saying he found the draft book \"troubling\" and recommending that Lord Mandelson look at his manuscript again.Lord Mandelson seems put out by his friend's assessment, saying: \"You have read it too fast. It is not those things. But nor is it yet finished.\"By 2012, the friendship between the two men appears to have soured somewhat.In one exchange, Epstein expresses his \"disappointment\" that their relationship has been a \"one way street\".\"… jeffrey can I have, jeffrey can you give jeffrey can you organize… can you call, can you arrange .. you have yet to offer real assistance, sign of gratitude or appreciation. …sorry.\"Lord Mandelson is apparently stung by Epstein's criticism and tells him in a reply \"how much I appreciate your support,\" adding \"during your trials and tribulations I never left your side, I was always there with advice and moral support, and I never turned away\".Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJack Fenwick,Political correspondentandLauren Tavriger,Political reporterUS Department of JusticeLord Mandelson offered to help Jeffrey Epstein obtain a Russian visa, which the paedophile financier planned to use to meet young women in Moscow, documents released by the US government suggest.There is no indication that the politician knew why Epstein wanted the visa, and further emails suggest the trip was cancelled because it couldn't be obtained.Epstein was awaiting charges of trafficking minors from around the world for sex when he died in his prison cell in 2019.Lord Mandelson, a senior minister in the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments, resigned from the House of Lords this week after newly released files on Epstein revealed the extent of their relationship.It is not known what the primary reason was for Epstein's planned trip to Moscow in 2010, but emails suggested he was going to meet women while there.On 9 November 2010, Epstein emailed Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate and modelling agent, to let him know he was thinking of travelling to Moscow the following week.Brunel, who killed himself in 2022 while being investigated for the trafficking of minors for sexual exploitation, appeared to reply and said: \"I am getting my visa\".Emails from the same day show that Epstein asked Mandelson, who had left government six months before, if he could help in acquiring a Russian visa.Epstein, who was in France, emailed Mandelson and said: \"I do not have a visa for Russia, it is a bank holiday in paris today... any ideas how i can get one.\"The documents released by the US Department of Justice suggest that Lord Mandelson replied hours later indicating that he was willing to help.At this point, Epstein had already served a prison sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor.BBC News has seen no evidence to suggest that Mandelson asked why Epstein needed a visa to visit Russia at short notice.The following day, Mandelson emailed Epstein again and said that an associate of his was \"helping on visas\".The days that Epstein wanted to travel to Moscow match up with email exchanges regarding obtaining a visa.On the same day that Epstein asked Mandelson for help, the financier sent an email to a woman in Russia asking if they had any \"news?\".She replied later that day and said: \"I really want to have someone very nice soon for you, working on it!\"She added: \"I have around 10 friends I'm working on now\".She also discussed a woman who they said would be \"back in Moscow in a few days\".Three days later Epstein said to the woman he would be \"back next week// any luck\".She replied and referred to what appears to be a 22-year-old woman who Epstein had previously indicated he had no interest in.She said: \"I know you didn't like photo of [redacted] 22, however if you change your mind let me know, she is a very very nice and sweet girl, just from Moscow. I'm 90 percent sure she will be interested.\"She went on to describe another \"gorgeous\" woman who was \"really interested\". They said they had \"told her everything and she is completely fine\".Later that day she was sending a picture of another woman who \"wants to be an actress, study design, was a gymnast\".She added that she had \"interviewed\" this woman, who she said was \"really nice and interesting\" and said they were \"getting friendly with her and will have a talk soon!\".She also referenced a planned brunch with another person, who it appears Epstein had already received a photograph of.The email said: \"she is bringing her girlfriend along, hopefully a good looking one! Will make photos.\"She asked Epstein to \"let us know what day you arrive so I'll come with [redacted].\"The email ended: \"I am very excited about your guests, going to the gym now to be prepared!!!\".Epstein replied to say there was \"no picture attached\" and received a response: \"sorry...here's the picture! not the best one, so I also found some others on her facebook page.\"Multiple emails suggest that Epstein planned to fly from Paris to Moscow in the days following this exchange.Emails also indicate that Mandelson visited Epstein in Paris on the day this exchange was sent.On 11 November, Epstein emailed his close friend Jes Staley to say that \"petie [Mandelson], and others in paris this weekend\".On 12 November, Mandelson received an email with the subject \"Paris\" which read: \"Hi peter, Valdson, Jeffrey's driver, will be picking you up today from the train station... see you this evening!\"There is no suggestion that Mandelson knew the reason Epstein wanted to visit Russia.The documents also show that the Moscow trip was ultimately cancelled because of delays in obtaining the necessary visas.On 15 November, an associate of Mandelson's, who had been advising Epstein's assistant on Russian visas, emailed to ask if they had obtained them yet.Epstein's assistant replied and said the Moscow trip was no longer going ahead because it was \"going to take too long to get visas in paris\".They added: \"Thank you very much for all your help in this matter and sorry that it didn't work out in the end!\"Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment. He has previously said he was not complicit or culpable in Epstein's crimes and has apologised to the women and girls who suffered.Jean-Luc Brunel always denied any wrongdoing.Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication wrongdoing.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterGetty ImagesTesting period blood for signs of cervical cancer could be an accurate and convenient way of screening for the disease, researchers say.The current NHS test involves a nurse or doctor taking a sample of cells from the cervix - but a third of women invited for screening do not attend.A study of the new test, which can be carried out at home, used blood collected on a cotton strip attached to a standard sanitary pad. Cervical cancer charities say finding new and potentially gentler ways of testing for the disease is encouraging and could improve access, although it is still early days for this research.The NHS is already sending at-home test kits to women in some areas of England who have missed several cervical screening appointments. These DIY test kits containing a vaginal swab will be sent out more widely at some point this year.Cervical screening appointments are offered to all women, and anyone with a cervix, every five years between the age of 25 and 64 in the UK. Screening looks for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cancer.A nurse or doctor carries out the test, which involves a speculum being inserted into the vagina to allow access to the cervix.But five million women are not up to date with the test, research shows, and there are many reasons why - including fear, pain and discomfort.\"Cervical screening can be difficult for some women for many reasons, like if they have had a bad previous experience, they are menopausal, they have a physical or learning disability, cultural barriers, or are a survivor of sexual violence,\" says Athena Lamnisos from charity The Eve Appeal.Younger women, those with disabilities, or those from ethnic minority communities and LGBT+ groups are more likely to miss appointments, officials say.'Encouraging'Testing period blood would be an even less invasive option, say the Chinese researchers behind the new study in the journal The BMJ, adding it could be \"a robust alternative\" to current methods.Their study, involving more than 3,000 women aged 20-54 years, compared the effectiveness of testing period blood collected on mini-pads to samples collected by clinicians. Women were told about the results via a specially designed app.When the samples were sent to the lab, the researchers found that testing blood was nearly as good at picking up people who had the disease as the other methods, and very good at picking up those who didn't.The researchers say using menstrual blood for HPV testing is \"convenient\" - not only respecting women's privacy, but also reducing their discomfort.Anyone who tests positive for HPV would be sent for a colposcopy, which uses a special magnifying instrument that allows medics to closely examine the cervix to look for pre-cancerous cells.Experts say period blood tests are not an immediate alternative to current cervical screening because only women who menstruate could use them. Others say the study could have overestimated the performance of the test because not all women had a biopsy - a more detailed test -  to double check the result.Sophie Brooks, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said it was \"encouraging\" to see research exploring new ways of making cervical screening \"more accessible\".She said testing menstrual blood for HPV was an interesting and non-invasive approach but stressed that more research in more diverse groups was needed to find out how it could fit into existing screening.Athena Lamnisos from The Eve Appeal said it was \"exciting\" to see new, more acceptable ways of offering a potentially life-saving test.\"People have different barriers and concerns about screening, so being able to offer a choice of different methods could be very positive for some who are eligible for screening but don't currently attend,\" she said.",

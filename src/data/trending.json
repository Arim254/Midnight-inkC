    "body": "David Dimbleby: Can William's 'ordinary Joe' approach win back more support for the monarchy?23 minutes agoDavid DimblebyPresenter, What's the Monarchy For?BBCI've spent much of my career commentating on royal occasions, and over the past two years I've been looking at the institution in close detail for a personal-view documentary series, interviewing former private secretaries and communications advisers, along with royal historians, friends of King Charles III and staunch anti-monarchists, trying to understand how it works and why it has had such a hold on Britain.Now, polls suggest public approval is in decline.When asked how important it was to continue having a monarchy, as part of the first British Social Attitudes survey back in 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\". In last year's survey, just 51% of people answered the same. The proportion of young people approving of the monarchy is lower still.That's not to say that people want an elected head of state instead - a majority don't. And finding an elected President who could unite Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland would, I suspect, be a good deal harder than some republicans think.But the declining support marks a problem. Getty ImagesIn 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\" to continue having a monarchy, as part of a British Social Attitudes survey. In last year's survey, 51% of people answered the same\"The only way the monarchy works is by everybody either being apathetic or feeling very affectionate towards it,\" argues Anna Whitelock, a professor of the history of monarchy at City, University of London.\"If those bonds are broken, there really is no purpose or point of monarchy.\"Plenty of people might be quick to put the most recent threat to those bonds down to scandal. There is no love lost between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, and the British public. Only 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of him in a YouGov poll in October (the same month he was stripped of his titles), followed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with ratings of 30% and 21% respectively.Yet no-one I spoke to while making these films pointed to any one individual as the sole reason for the current standing of the monarchy in the eyes of the public.AFP via Getty ImagesOnly 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of Andrew in a YouGov poll in October, the same month he was stripped of his titlesI suspect the real challenge facing the Royal Family is the fundamental question of what it stands for in the modern world - a world radically different to the one Elizabeth II reigned over when she ascended the throne in 1952.Even though there is evidence that suggests change is on the agenda, as the Prince of Wales acknowledged last month, what should he do, as heir to the throne - and what should King Charles do as reigning monarch - to win back more support for the institution?Winning the 'oxygen of public support'Three monarchs have been on the throne during my lifetime, and each understood that what matters is the impression they make on their subjects: their image.As the journalist and editor Ian Hislop put it when I interviewed him for my documentary series, What's The Monarchy For? \"They thrive on the oxygen of public support\".It is, ultimately, the key to their survival.They surround themselves with people who know this too. Lord Janvrin was the private secretary to the late queen until 2007. \"If you took public support for granted it would be a very bad day,\" he told me.Prof Whitelock takes this a step further. \"The Royal family is a brand,\" she explains. \"There is always a sense of needing to keep the brand popular.\"Getty ImagesThe Prince and Princess of Wales with their children at Westminster Abbey for the 'Together at Christmas' carol serviceOne of the boldest attempts the Royal Family has ever made to redefine its public image - and keep that brand popular - came back in 1969 when, for the first time, they invited cameras into the heart of family life.The film, titled Royal Family, which was broadcast on BBC and ITV, was an attempt to try to humanise them.The late queen was filmed in colour, buying a treat for a four-year-old Prince Edward in a shop, using money from her purse. \"What are you going to have? A lolly?\" she was filmed saying, briskly. \"An ice cream,\" Edward replied. As he settled in the front seat of the car, she suggested he might make a \"gooey mess\".Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThis documentary was, at the time, one of the boldest attempts the Royal Family had made to redefine its public imageThere was a picnic scene too, with Prince Philip and the Princess Royal seen barbecuing sausages.The public lapped it up. Across both transmissions it had almost twice as many viewers as the first moon landing when it broadcast.Yet a few years later, the late queen is reported to have ordered that it should never be seen again. Some reports have suggested there were copyright claims, though the Times also reported speculation that there were concerns, or even regrets about it being made.Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA family portrait at Buckingham Palace in 1972Certainly Princess Anne didn't mince her words about the recording. \"I never liked the idea of the royal family film,\" she reportedly once said. \"I always thought it was a rotten idea.\"But it's a good example of how the Royal Family endeavour to present themselves as they want to be seen.'The degree of control I think is staggering'In September 2022, I was at Windsor to report on the final stages of Elizabeth II's funeral. The Palace issued instructions to the broadcasters about scenes that, once shown live, should never be shown again.A number were quite small things, for example, the crown being handled, somebody looking visibly upset, Prince George touching his nose, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's handkerchiefs, and, at the lying in state, shots of the Royal Family mouthing the Lord's Prayer.These little excisions from reality - or \"perpetuity edits,\" a kind of George Orwell speak - see them remove from the world anything they don't like.On the one hand, they have the right to grieve in private; on the other, the late queen was our head of state and this is her public funeral. Do we have a right to see it all or do they have the right to control what we see?Getty Images\"The degree of control I think is staggering,\" argues Prof Whitelock. \"If Downing Street were trying to control what's being broadcast, that would be reported upon, but if the Palace is intervening in what's being shown about certain things, why is that not seen as something that should be reported?\"However, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has said: \"The events surrounding the funeral of Her Late Majesty were both State occasions and moments of profound personal sorrow for her loved ones. In striking the appropriate balance between those two factors, simple human decency pointed towards a sensitive and sympathetic approach so as not to intrude on elements of individual grief or personal religious observance.\"In particular, we do not believe it would have been fair or appropriate to focus on younger members of the family at a time of mourning.\"Prince William and the e-scooterRecently, Prince William joined forces with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy for an episode of his travel comedy series that aired last month.Mr Levy appeared particularly amused to see his entrance - zipping around Windsor Castle on an e-scooter.\"It gets around quite nicely,\" the Prince explained, later adding: \"I'm always late so I thought this was a way to keep my meetings on time.\" He chatted on about which of Levy's films he had enjoyed. (\"All of the American Pies!\")A bright idea - the image getting across is that William is just an ordinary Joe.'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William saysThe social media posts that Prince William and his family share to their 17.1 million followers have a similar approach, with many showing them off-duty, with videos shot in woods, on sand dunes. One shows the Princess of Wales sharing her relief at having finished chemotherapy treatment, and reflecting on the importance \"of simply loving and being loved\".British \"adman\" Rory Sutherland, who has spent 37 years in the heart of the advertising world, currently as vice-chairman of Ogilvy, fully approves of the Waleses' approach to striking a more modern tone.\"I think he's walked the line, which is a very narrow line between modernity and kind of absurdity extremely well,\" he says of Prince William. \"It is a very delicate path to tread.\"It is, he adds, far less crude than one memorable attempt by the generation before him, when Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Andrew took part in It's a Royal Knockout charity tournament in 1987, presiding over teams of celebrities who wore costumes and did challenges like lobbing ham at each other.And it seems to be resonating. Prince William and Catherine have public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively - higher than all other family members in last month's YouGov survey.Getty ImagesPrince William and Catherine have strong public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively,  a YouGov poll suggestsProf Whitelock, though positive about Prince William and his fellow senior Royals' attempts to seem more accessible, is less sure about whether that is enough to modernise the institution as a whole.\"If the monarchy is really to modernise in a significant way, we need to see much more transparency, much more accountability,\" she argues.Tax, politics and royal lifestylesIn talking to people as research for my documentary, there seem to me to be other factors, which are potential stumbling blocks to fuller public support.First, the fact that the monarch is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax on his personal income, because the relevant laws do not apply to the Crown, and only does so voluntarily - and that he was not legally obliged to pay inheritance tax after the death of his mother.\"I think the best way to make those concessions is voluntarily rather than under duress. It's a better look certainly,\" says Rory Sutherland.A spokesperson for Kensington Palace has also said that the Prince of Wales voluntarily pays the top rate of income and capital gains tax on all his personal income, including receipts from the Duchy. No explanation was given, when asked for the documentary series, as to why the Prince of Wales has chosen not to follow his father's example of publishing his tax returns since inheriting the role.Getty ImagesKing Charles is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax but does so voluntarilySecond, the fact that the monarch has the right to be consulted on proposed legislation that may affect the Crown and can ask to be excluded from it. The question of whether the monarch takes up this right, or the extent to which it may or may not have an impact, are other matters - some have argued that the right in itself gives any monarch potential to influence.Then there is their lifestyle - particularly  when many people in the country face a cost of living crisis.Mr Sutherland does not believe the fact the royals live in palaces to be something the public particularly cares about. But he adds: \"I always thought that skiing holidays are a bit of a bad look.\"Of course there is the economic case of the sheer amount of money that the Royal Family brings to the UK thanks to tourism - but Mr Sutherland argues that while \"you can emphatically make an economic case\", it is not the right way to justify the royal's continued existence.How European monarchies workPrince William has been forthright in stating that he has change in mind.\"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda… Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen,\" he told Mr Levy.He also said: \"There are points when you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\"So I like to question things, is what I'm really getting at.\"Getty Images'I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,' Prince William has saidIt remains unclear exactly what he means by this. Whether it is simply fewer courtiers, a bit less ceremony, no more people calling him sir, or bowing. Or is it possible William envisages much more of a rethink?There has been some debate over the years about whether or not there is merit in a bigger shift: in making the British Royal Family more in line with the Dutch royal family, or the Scandinavian ones with a much more informal and modest style.Prof Whitelock for one believes certain parts of it could well appeal to the prince. \"I don't think the idea of dressing up in all the stuff for the coronation is something that appeals to him.\"But it comes with risks. \"Those who really support the monarchy like all that comes with it, so if we got to a point where we it looks like the Scandinavian monarchies that don't have big coronations… some people might say 'what's the point now'?\"If people are asked what defines Britain,\" she adds, \"I'm sure before too long you do get to the monarch.\"Getty ImagesThe Dutch royal family - King Willem-Alexander attended schools in the Netherlands but finished his secondary education at Atlantic College in WalesGraham Smith, chief executive of pressure group, Republic, is one of those (albeit in a UK minority) who argue that no amount of reform would be enough to win his approval.\"You should not have that family in that position of privilege and status,\" he tells me. \"They are just a bunch of very ordinary people, who just happen to be related to people who, hundreds of years ago, built big castles and won a few battles.\"Essentially, it's a ridiculous institution, which… has no justification.\"AFP via Getty ImagesMany people find having a Royal Family consoling and representative of the United KingdomI put to him that over half the country don't think it's ridiculous - many people find it consoling and representative of the United Kingdom, maybe something better than politicians. The newspapers are full of talk about monarchy too.\"Yes there is an audience,\" he says pointedly. \"But there's also an audience for the Kardashians and David Beckham.\"A masterclass in reinventionI still remember firsthand one of the Royal Family's low points. It was a Sunday in 1997 and I received the news that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in the crash in Paris. I was working at the BBC at the time and we were summoned to cover what had happened.We had no inkling at the time what the public response would be - but it was soon clear that something astonishing was happening.There was an outpouring of popular grief. The press started reporting that thousands of people in London were bringing flowers to Kensington Palace but that the Royal Family had remained up in Balmoral and were not responding.Getty ImagesLord Janvrin was in Balmoral with the late queen. \"A choice had to be made between looking after the two young princes and getting back to London.\"Yet the public criticism was sharp. It was a lesson in the cruel demands of monarchy on those who belong to it. And a lesson to never again get behind the story.Support for the monarchy had already been declining. The year after Diana's death, it dipped further, with just 63.5% of people saying it was important for Britain to have a monarchy, according to the British Attitudes Survey. It took time for the approval ratings to climb back to their previous levels – but eventually they did, reaching 75% by 2012.It shows that this institution can recover from disapproval.Getty ImagesThe present and the future of the monarchy: King Charles III and the Prince of Wales\"It is highly, highly culturally adaptive,\" says Mr Sutherland, \"and obviously an 18th century monarchy might look absurd to us today but at the time it was permanently effectively adapting to changed circumstances, which is one of the reasons it is still around and lots of monarchies aren't.\"No matter what changes Prince William makes - nor Prince George after him - the bigger question of what becomes of the monarchy in the distant future may not be theirs to decide.The monarchy's existence thrives on the \"oxygen of public support\", so it is the public themselves who will decide through that support whether having this kind of head of state continues to suit us as a country.David Dimbleby's documentary series, What's the Monarchy For? starts on Tuesday 2 December on BBC1 and BBC iPlayerMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

After weeks of insulting each other during the mayoral campaign, Republicans and Democrats are still reacting to what turned out to be a very amicable and friendly meeting.\nTrump has promised to help Mamdani make New York City a success, and “great again”, but what does this actually mean, and will the US president do it? We also look at how Mamdani will be navigating the wider politics of being a mayor, particularly with midterm elections in 2026. In New York state, can Mamdani persuade his Democratic governor to put up taxes for the wealthiest? And how will he balance maintaining good relations with both Trump and Demoratic socialists in New York? \nMeanwhile, with Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik running for governor, how will the Republican campaign deal with the president’s new attitude towards Mamdani? \nSarah and Anthony are joined by Nick Reisman, POLITICO’s Albany Bureau Chief and New York politics expert.  \nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\n- Nick Reisman, Albany Bureau Chief for Politico \nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Adriana Urbano.

    "body": "Reeves denies she misled public over UK's finances in run-up to Budget3 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterLaura Kuenssberg presses Rachel Reeves on whether the public was misled before BudgetChancellor Rachel Reeves has rejected claims she misled the public about the nation's finances in the run-up to her Budget.Reeves was challenged on the BBC to explain why she had repeatedly warned about a downgrade to the UK's economic productivity forecasts - including in a speech on 4 November - ahead of Wednesday's Budget.It has since emerged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) told her in mid-September the public finances were in better shape than widely thought, with Reeves omitting to mention a forecast of higher wages.Reeves said the OBR figures were clear there had been \"less fiscal space than there was\" and that she had been \"upfront\" about her decision-making. But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch repeated her call for the chancellor to quit.When pressed on the issue on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Reeves said she did not \"accept\" she had been misleading. Badenoch, also appearing on the programme, said she was not satisfied with the chancellor's denial, however.The Conservatives have accused the chancellor of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes, with Badenoch claiming Reeves had \"lied to the public\".But Downing Street has denied the accusations and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to back Reeves' budget decisions in a speech on Monday, saying the chancellor's decisions would help tackle cost of living pressures and lower inflation.Reeves was asked by Kuenssberg if she could be trusted, responding that she could.Kuenssberg then outlined what the chancellor said in a speech on 4 November, when Reeves indicated there was less cash than previously forecast due to a productivity downgrade, and she was likely going to need to raise taxes as a result.Reeves explained that, despite what critics were saying, \"I didn't have an extra £4bn to play with\" but instead that the OBR figures had been downgraded from £9.9bn headroom in spring to £4.2bn in the autumn.Headroom is the term for money left over after the government meets its expected budget costs under its own fiscal rules, providing a financial buffer for unexpected costs.\"I clearly could not deliver a budget with just £4.2bn of headroom,\" she said, as that would have been \"the lowest surplus any chancellor ever delivered\", and she would \"rightly\" have been facing criticism for the headroom being too small.She said: \"I was clear that I wanted to build up that resilience and that is why I took those decisions to get that headroom up to £21.7bn.\"Pushed on whether she had exaggerated the situation in order to pave the way for a £16bn increase in welfare, Reeves said she also had to factor in policy choices made in the previous six months on welfare and the Winter Fuel Allowance.She said: \"I did say when those policies changed just before the summer that we would have to find that money in the Budget, so I was very upfront about that.\"Yes, I did make the decision in the Budget to scrap the two-child [benefit] limit  - that was funded by increases on online gambling taxes and also by cracking down on tax avoidance and tax evasion, fully costed and fully funded, and lifting half a million children out of poverty.\"Asked if she had broken the spirit, if not the letter, of her manifesto commitment on taxation by freezing income tax thresholds, Reeves said: \"I recognise I did not say that in the manifesto, but since then we've had both a significant downgrade in the productivity forecast but also huge global turbulence.\"She added: \"I have to respond to all those things because, if I were to lose control of the public  finances, we would be punished.\"Punished by financial markets that hold £2.6tn of public debt, and punished with higher interest rates, which wouldn't affect just the country but would also affect every single business that borrows, and every single family that has a mortgage.\"Kemi Badenoch on Reeves: 'I believe she should resign'Badenoch said she was \"absolutely not\" satisfied with Reeves' explanation and she should instead have cut welfare spending. She said: \"The chancellor called an emergency press conference telling everyone about how terrible the state of the finances were and now we have seen that the OBR was telling her the complete opposite. \"She was raising taxes to pay for welfare - the only thing that was unfunded was the welfare payments that she has made, and she's doing it on the backs of a lot of people out there who are working very hard and getting poorer - and because of that I believe she should resign.\"She accused the chancellor of trying to \"pitch-roll her budget - tell everyone how awful it would be and then they wouldn't be as upset when she finally announced it\", which could constitute \"market manipulation\".Tory shadow chancellor Mel Stride has written to the Financial Conduct Authority asking it to investigate \"possible market abuse\" by people working in the Treasury and Downing Street in the run-up to the Budget. The SNP has also written to the body.The Conservatives have also written to the prime minister calling for Reeves to come before MPs on Monday to explain her conduct surrounding the Budget and period leading to it.Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage has reported Reeves to the the independent adviser on ministerial ethics to investigate whether she broke the ministerial code over her pre-Budget interventions.Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said there were \"very serious questions to answer\" and is understood to have submitted an urgent question in Parliament on the issue.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says talks with Ukraine over a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war were productive, but there's \"more work to be done\". The talks, held in Florida, were attended by a Ukrainian delegation led by national security council secretary Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's new chief negotiator. Also at the meeting were President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Witkoff is due to visit Moscow for talks next week.  Umerov was brought in to replace the Ukrainian president's top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, after he quit following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Sunday's meeting is the latest step in two weeks of intense diplomatic activity.    It was sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago.\"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said at the meeting in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"He also told the Ukrainian delegation that the aim of peace talks with Russia is to leave Ukraine \"sovereign, independent and prosperous\".As Sunday's talks began, Umerov said: \"We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine\". \"US is hearing us,\" he said, speaking in English. \"US is supporting us. US is working beside us.\"He later described the talks as \"productive and successful\" while Rubio said they had been \"very productive and useful\".Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the talks were \"going along well\", and there was a good chance of a deal being made to end the conflict. Trump said earlier he would send Witkoff and possibly also Kushner to Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss the peace plan which has been much revised. In a post on social media, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"It is important that the talks have a constructive dynamic and that all issues were discussed openly and with a clear focus on ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and national interests.\"He added he was grateful to the US and Trump for their efforts to try and end the war. One crucial unresolved issue is the fate of Ukrainian territory that Russia has either annexed or controls.The talks in Florida were \"not easy\", a source who is said to be close to the Ukrainian delegation told AFP news agency.\"But everyone is trying to be constructive and find a solution,\" the source added.  Zelensky is due to visit Paris on Monday for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong ally.  Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured, as well as thousands of civilians, and at least seven million people have become refugees since Russia invaded on 24 February 2022.     The conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.

    "body": "3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesDo you find yourself getting increasingly irate while scrolling through your social media feed?If so, you may be falling victim to rage bait, which Oxford University Press has named its word or phrase of the year.It is a term that describes manipulative tactics used to drive engagement online, with usage of it increasing threefold in the last 12 months, according to the dictionary publisher.Rage bait beat two other shortlisted terms - aura farming and biohack - to win the title.The list of words is intended to reflect some of the moods and conversations that have shaped 2025.What is rage bait?Even if you don't know the term, if you're a social media user, it's quite likely you have been rage baited.According to Oxford University Press, which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary, it is defined as online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive.What is rage baiting and why is it profitable?Such content is typically posted in order to increase traffic to websites or social media accounts.It is similar to its internet cousin clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader in to view an article or video.But rage bait content has a more specific focus on making people cross.What do the other shortlisted words mean?Aura farming: The cultivation of an impressive, attractive, or charismatic persona or public image by behaving or presenting oneself in a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness, or mystique.Biohack: To attempt to improve or optimise one's physical or mental performance, health, longevity, or wellbeing by altering one's diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle, or by using other means such as drugs, supplements, or technological devices.The three shortlisted words were put to a public vote, the results of which helped to guide the final decision taken by OUP's language experts.\"The fact that the word rage bait exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" said Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages.\"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"It feels like the natural progression in an ongoing conversation about what it means to be human in a tech-driven world - and the extremes of online culture.\"Getty ImagesPrevious words of the year have included goblin mode, a slang term for lazy behaviourLast year's word of the year, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.Mr Grathwohl said both 2024 and 2025's winners have a similar theme.\"Together, they form a powerful cycle where outrage sparks engagement, algorithms amplify it, and constant exposure leaves us mentally exhausted,\" he said.Previous Oxford words of the year have included selfie, goblin mode and rizz.Cambridge Dictionary has declared parasocial its word of 2025, which it defined as a relationship felt by someone between themselves and a famous person they do not know.Its examples include the interest displayed by fans when pop star Taylor Swift and American footballer Travis Kelce announced their engagement.Meanwhile, Collins Dictionary went for vibe coding, which is the art of making an app or website by describing it to artificial intelligence rather than by writing programming code manually.",

Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games. A New South Wales Police spokesperson told the BBC that they were not currently looking for any other person in relation to the alleged fraud.In a subsequent search of their accommodation near the casino, officers found other \"gambling props\", high-end jewellery and €2,000 (£1,750; $2,320) in cash.The pair appeared in court on Friday and were denied bail, New South Wales police said.Mrs Israilova is due back in court in February, the Guardian Australia reports, while Mr Israilov is scheduled to appear on 11 December.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAstudestra Ajengrastri,Jakarta,Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, BangkokandPatrick JacksonReutersResidents look at flood damage in Padang on SundayRescuers in Indonesia are searching for at least 400 people who have been reported missing, many believed to be buried under landslides, after cyclonic rains caused disastrous flooding nearly a week ago.The death toll on the island of Sumatra has risen to more than 440, the government says.Aid has been sent into affected areas by air and by sea, but some villages have yet to receive anything, and there are reports of people stealing food and water to survive.Torrential rain and storms have devastated parts of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, affecting millions of people and leaving more than 900 dead across the region this month.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsAn exceptionally rare tropical storm, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.People are missing in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra, the National Disaster Management Agency said.\"There are two cities that require full attention due to being isolated, namely Central Tapanuli and Sibolga,\" agency head Suharyanto was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Ships were expected in Sibolga on Monday, he added.Some foreign aid has arrived, with Malaysia sending medical supplies to Aceh, one of the worst-hit provinces. AFP via Getty ImagesThis sick villager was evacuated in Aceh on SaturdayIn Sungai Nyalo village, about 100km (62 miles) from West Sumatra's capital Padang, floodwaters had mostly receded on Sunday, leaving homes, vehicles and crops coated in thick grey mud, AFP reports.The authorities had not yet begun clearing roads, residents said, and no outside assistance had arrived.\"Most villagers chose to stay; they didn't want to leave their houses behind,\" Idris, 55, told the news agency.Police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said there were reports of people breaking into shops on Sumatra, and police had been sent in to restore order, the Associated Press news agency reported.\"The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,\" Mr Walintukan added. \"Residents] didn't know that aid would come and were worried they would starve.\"In another development, tech billionaire Elon Musk said he would provide free Starlink services to support communications during the emergency.ReutersAid was delivered by navy helicopter to Palembayan on Sunday There has been widespread devastation across the region.At least 170 people died in floods in Thailand and there were several deaths reported in Malaysia. In Sri Lanka, more than 330 people died from floods and mudslides as the country grappled with one of its worst weather disasters in years.While the torrential rains have now subsided, low-lying areas of the capital, Colombo, are still flooded and many areas in the centre of the country remain cut off.In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people joined protests against government corruption on Sunday, for the second time this month, following a series of disastrous floods which killed more than 200 people. EPAAn effigy of President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos J could be seen at Sunday's protests in Manila The government has acknowledged that substantial funds meant to finance flood control have been lost through corruption. Public anger over the issue now threatens the administration of President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.There were two large protests in the capital Manila, one organised by the Roman Catholic Church and the other by unions, students and left-wing activists. Their complaint is the same – that money designated by the central government for flood defences was diverted into the pockets of corrupt politicians, leaving many communities dangerously exposed to this year's exceptionally heavy rainfall. But determining who is responsible is proving harder. Marcos Jr has sacked several politicians and officials he blames for stealing flood funds.However, one of those politicians, who is now in hiding, has accused the president himself of supervising the corruption - Marcos Jr has dismissed that as propaganda. His own sister, Senator Imee Marcos, has now joined opposition to him, and Vice-President Sara Duterte, a bitter rival of the president, says she is ready to take over should he be forced to resign. However, she too faces different corruption allegations. Much now depends on whether the protests continue in the coming weeks and whether any more of the president's allies desert him. He will be mindful that two of his predecessors, including his father, were ousted by popular protest movements stirred up by corruption.",

    "body": "4 hours agoImogen Foulkes,GenevaandTom BennettThe founder of the Swiss right-to-die organisation Dignitas has died by assisted suicide, the group says.Ludwig Minelli, 92, died on Saturday, days before his 93rd birthday.The group paid tribute to Minelli, saying he had led a \"life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights\".Minelli founded Dignitas in 1998, and since then it has helped thousands of people to die. In recent decades, some countries have shifted their stance on assisted dying, with Australia, Canada and New Zealand introducing laws. The UK House of Lords is currently debating the assisted dying bill. Critics of the legalisation say it could see disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives.Minelli began his career as a journalist, working as a correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, before studying law and taking an interest in human rights.Across his life, he campaigned passionately for the right to die, giving Dignitas the slogan \"dignity in life, dignity in death\". In a 2010 interview with the BBC, he said: \"I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies. And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one's own end, and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain.\"Minelli founded Dignitas after splitting from the older Swiss assisted dying organisation, Exit, because he felt its rules were too restrictive. The group became world famous because it offers assisted suicide to non-Swiss citizens who travel to Switzerland because assisted dying is not permitted in their own countries.Within Switzerland he was sometimes criticised for an alleged lack of transparency over the financial dealings of the organisation, and for offering assisted dying to those who were not terminally ill, but who wanted to end their lives.He faced numerous legal challenges, and made multiple successful appeals to the Swiss supreme courtIn a statement, Dignitas said his work had had a lasting influence, pointing to a 2011 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, in which it confirmed the right of a person capable of judgement to decide on the manner and the time of their own end of life.Euthanasia - when a lethal drug is administered by a physician to deliberately end a person's life to relieve suffering - is illegal in Switzerland.But assisted dying has been permitted under Swiss law since 1942, under strict conditions including a stipulation that there is no profit motive involved, and that the individual wishing to die is of sound mind.Dignitas said in a statement that it would continue to \"manage and develop the association in the spirit of its founder as a professional and combative international organisation for self-determination and freedom of choice in life and at the end of life\".If you've been affected by issues in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

My family did, my friends did and it was a very difficult time, not just for me, but also realising that my mistake has not only impacted my life but could impact other people's lives and impact even just broader communities around me.\"After losing the no-confidence vote at Oxford Union in October, Mr Abaraonye said the poll was \"compromised\" by \"untested\" regulations.He also claimed people campaigning to oust him had \"unsupervised access\" to the email account collecting proxy votes.Oxford Union has denied claims the poll was compromised.",

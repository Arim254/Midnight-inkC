    "body": "Media caption, Highlights: Dundee United 2-1 CelticByBBC Scotland's chief sports writerAt this point, it's not just Wilfried Nancy's Celtic team that's a hard watch, it's Nancy himself. So many explanations and justifications, so many verbal contortions as he attempts to talk through his latest defeat. It's become painful, quickly.\"I think I am in a good direction with the players,\" he said after his fourth defeat in a row in his new job, a 2-1 loss at struggling Dundee United. \"Today you saw we had a good performance,\" he stated. \"We are improving,\" he insisted. \"We were close to winning... keep the faith.\"All around him now there are football atheists. There really can't be many believers left. As Nancy spoke, it was hard to avoid wincing and wincing and wincing again. As he made his way through his post-match assessment, the temptation was to shout, 'Stop... stop talking... stop explaining because when you're explaining, you're losing, again'.The bottom line in all of this is that between his nightmarish beginning with Celtic and his low-key ending with Columbus Crew, Nancy has won just three of his past 16 games as a manager. The defeats by United, St Mirren, Roma and Hearts now joined the ones that went before in America - Cincinnati (twice), Chicago Fire, New York City and New England Revolution.Nancy finished seventh in the regular season in MLS, won 14 of 34 games, ranking joint sixth in the league for goals scored and eighth for goals conceded. After being manager of the season the year before, it was all very blah. His credentials for the Celtic job were, at best, thin, despite the excited rhetoric of some observers in America, who painted him as a special one and his capture as a coup.Is Nancy already doomed? And who's to blame?Media caption, 'Keep the faith' urges Nancy after fourth defeatThere are questions here. Many of them. Is he already doomed? If not, how long has he got? Celtic host Aberdeen on Sunday. Can he survive if he loses again? How many is too many? Five? Six? Seven?And, given his humdrum season with Columbus Crew, how did Nancy get this job in the first place? Arguably, that's the biggest question of all. He'd been a manager at Montreal and Columbus for a total of four years - then he's given the Celtic job?\"We have been aware of Wilfried and his quality of work for some time,\" said Michael Nicholson, Celtic's chief executive. \"He was our number one candidate when we began the process of appointing a new manager…\"What, exactly, was that process? Who else did Celtic talk to? How rigorous was their search? We don't know. The number one candidate?What we do know is that Nancy had Kwame Ampadu as his assistant in Columbus and that Ampadu and Celtic's director of football operations, Paul Tisdale, worked together at Exeter City more than a dozen years ago.On the back of a CV that shows spells at Bath, Exeter, MK Dons, Bristol Rovers, Colchester United and Stevenage, Tisdale has become a very significant figure at Celtic, one of the most influential characters in the place. How? Again, we're in the dark. Tisdale does not do interviews so there has been no chance to ask him anything.If he suggested to the Celtic board that Nancy was their man, on what basis did he form that conclusion? 'In three months, it's gone belly-up at Celtic, which is incredible' Scottish Football Podcast18/12/25How thoroughly were Nancy's credentials interrogated? From this remove - four games played, four games lost, three goals scored and 10 goals conceded - not thoroughly enough.From there to here was always going to be a mighty leap for Nancy, but nobody knew it was going to be Grand Canyonesque in a footballing sense.It's understandable that sections of the fans have turned on him - he seems like a good man in the wrong movie, which makes this crash in slow motion all the harder to observe - but what of the people who appointed him? What of Tisdale? He is as much to blame for the sorry mess that Celtic are in as Nancy is. More so, even. Tisdale has powerful sway over the recruitment work that Celtic do and yet, in the main, he escapes the heat of the fans who have been fixated on principal shareholder Dermot Desmond and members of the board. One of that board is leaving soon, of course. Peter Lawwell, a titan of the club for two decades, will depart at the end of the year, citing abuse and threats from a sinister element in the support that have impacted his family.Lawwell is a big enough operator to take stick on the chin, as he has done for years. When his family are drawn into it then it's another matter entirely. Celtic are in a dark place right now. Instead of more threats from zealots and incendiary statements from members of the Desmond family, it needs some healing, some understanding and some class. It needs dignity to break out where now there's just dysfunction. On the pitch and off Wednesday was a grim day for the club.'Incredible not to pick O'Neill's brain'Nancy must be wondering what the hell he's walked into and it's not hard to have some sympathy for him. He asked for context in the aftermath of Tannadice and, in his defence, there is some. Not a lot, but a little.It wasn't Nancy's fault that Johnny Kenny missed an easy chance or that Daizen Maeda spurned a sitter. The blame for having the inexperienced Kenny leading the Celtic line is not on Nancy. It lies with others way above him - the ones who orchestrated the club's slapstick transfer window in the summer.The new manager is missing key players in Alistair Johnston, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Jota, but there is no evidence that he would get the best out of them even if they weren't injured. He hasn't got the best out of the players he's had in four games now. Nothing like it. Amid a fog of tactical and selectorial confusion most of them have gone backwards.Once again, Celtic faded when it became a fight in that second half at Tannadice. Once again, an opponent spotted weakness and exploited it. Once again, Nancy was out-coached.Nancy talks about performance in the manner of a man who has time. He doesn't. The one unalienable truth about his job is that winning is everything, no matter how it happens. Martin O'Neill would have spelled that out to him had Nancy spent more than 15 minutes picking the brains of a guy who knows Celtic's past and Celtic's present better than anybody.It sounds like Nancy passed on the opportunity to mine the interim manager for information, which is incredible given he's a man at a new club in a new league in a new continent. For how much longer, it's hard to tell. Logic would say that Nancy is already on borrowed time, but logic doesn't seem to be pervasive at the club at the moment.Strange things are happening on the pitch and off. And at the weekend, Aberdeen are coming, sniffing points and smelling blood. There is no fear factor now. For the rest, against the diminished champions, opportunity knocks.Get in touchSend us your views on Celtic",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentPA MediaDiane Abbott is among those warning the prime minister Nearly 40 Labour MPs have warned the prime minister they are not prepared to support proposals to limit jury trials.In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, the MPs, largely but not wholly from the left of the party, say the plans are \"not a silver bullet\" to reducing the backlog in trials.\"To limit a fundamental right for what will make a marginal difference to the backlog, if any, is madness and will cause more problems than it solves,\" they write.Sir Keir has previously answered concerns from MPs about the plans by telling them that jury trials already make up only a small proportion of trials in the criminal courts system.In the Commons last week, he told Karl Turner - who organised the letter - that \"juries will remain a cornerstone of our justice system for the most serious cases\".The 39 MPs include prominent figures such as Diane Abbott, former whip and leading member of the Tribune group of Labour Vicky Foxcroft and Dan Carden, who leads the Blue Labour group of backbenchers.They suggest a number of other ways to reduce the courts backlog, including increasing sitting days, hiring more barristers as part-time judges called Recorders and asking the Crown Prosecution Service to consider bringing some cases in the backlog on a lower charge.The Justice Secretary, David Lammy, announced the measure on 3 December. It scraps jury trials in England and Wales for crimes that carry a likely sentence of less than three years, removing the right for defendants to ask for a jury trial where a case can be dealt with by either magistrates or a new form of judge-only Crown Court.The measure came after retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Brian Leveson was asked by the Lord Chancellor to come up with a series of proposals to reduce the backlog in the courts.The process started in December 2024. In July of this year, Sir Brian said \"fundamental\" reforms were needed to \"reduce the risk of total system collapse\". His proposals also included more out-of-court settlements like cautions.Announcing the jury trial measure, Lammy said it was necessary as current projections have Crown Court case loads reaching 100,000 by 2028, from the current backlog of almost 78,000.This means that a suspect being charged with an offence today may not reach trial until 2030. Among the impacts of this are that six out of 10 victims of rape are said to be withdrawing from prosecutions because of delays.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to unveil the agenda for the next phase of his government in the immediate aftermath of May's crucial elections.The King's Speech has been pencilled in for May 12 or 13 next year, the BBC has been told, just days after elections across Britain on 7 May.The elections in May cover the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd as well as thousands of council seats in England and a handful of directly elected mayoralties.Labour is braced for a bad night at the polls, which many Labour MPs believe could precipitate a challenge to Sir Keir's leadership.One government source told the BBC: \"It will be much harder for somebody to challenge the PM and say we need to go in a different direction when the King is about to come to parliament to announce what we're doing for the next year.\"Others dispute that there is any connection between the threat to Sir Keir's leadership and the date selected for the King's Speech, pointing out that in some recent years - most recently 2022 - the speech has taken place in May, when local elections are always held. The speech also took place very soon after local elections in 2021 and in 2016.The King's Speech is part of the state opening of Parliament, a ceremonial event marking the start of a parliamentary session, which typically lasts for a year but can run for much longer. The current session is on the long side, having begun after the general election in July 2024.The speech is written by the government but read by the Monarch from a throne in the House of Lords. It sets out the government's agenda for the coming session, specifying what pieces of legislation the government intends to pass.Cabinet ministers began the process of formally \"bidding\" for legislation they want to be included in the King's Speech around early October. Most ministers now know which bills Sir Keir wants to include in his post-May agenda, a source said.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterReutersNewly appointed BP chief executive Meg O'NeillBP has appointed a new chief executive, making Meg O'Neill the first woman to run a major global oil firm.The London-based energy giant said its current boss Murray Auchincloss would step down less than two years after he replaced Bernard Looney, who was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.BP executive vice president Carol Howle will serve as interim chief executive until Ms O'Neill, who has led Australian energy firm Woodside Energy since 2021, takes up her new role on 1 April.Ms O'Neill said she looks forward to helping BP \"do our part to meet the world's energy needs\".Mr Auchincloss, who took over from Mr Looney in September 2024, said he had told BP's chairman in September that he was open to stepping down \"were an appropriate leader identified\".\"I am confident that BP is now well positioned for significant growth and I look forward to watching the company's future progress,\" he said after Ms O'Neill's appointment was announced. He will serve in an advisory role until December 2026.Ms O'Neill said she would prioritise re-establishing the oil giant's market leadership, as well as advancing safety and driving innovation and sustainability.BP praised Ms O'Neill's time as chief executive of Woodside Energy, pointing to the firm's takeover of BHP Petroleum International in 2022.It said she had grown the business into the largest energy company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.Before joining Woodside, Ms O'Neill spent 23 years in technical, operational and leadership positions at Texas-based energy firm ExxonMobil.Mr Looney was dismissed without notice in 2023, and forfeited up to £32.4m ($43.3m) in salary and benefits, after admitting that he was not \"fully transparent\" about his past personal relationships.BP's board said they had been \"knowingly misled\" by Mr Looney.At the time, Mr Looney said in a statement that he was \"disappointed with the way this situation has been handled\".Ms O'Neill's appointment comes as BP is cutting its renewable energy investments and instead focusing on increasing oil and gas production.In February, the energy giant said it would shift its strategy following pressure from some investors who were frustrated that its profits and share price had lagged behind rivals.Rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's call to \"drill baby drill\" has encouraged firms to invest in fossil fuels.The sudden departure of Mr Auchincloss comes only three months after the appointment of a new chair of the BP board, Albert Manifold.Energy consultant and former Shell executive Robin Mills told the BBC's Today programme that the \"surprise\" appointment of Ms O'Neill was about refocusing on its core oil and gas businesses.\"The new chairman, Albert Manifold, has really decided to put his stamp on things,\" he said.\"I think the announcement that's been put here made it very clear that he felt Murray [Auchincloss] had done a decent job, but not  enough and more was needed and some new leadership, some new blood.\"",

    "body": "Sir Chris Hoy is in his kitchen, chatting about early-morning coffee and fry-ups.And mindsets.An Olympic champion's mindset to be exact.An exacting, leave-no-stone-unturned, meticulous mindset that defined a career in which he won six gold medals and one silver across four Olympic Games.This is the same mindset he is relying on more than ever to reframe his entire existence and purpose following a terminal cancer diagnosis.\"We normally have a fry-up for breakfast but, when you guys are here, we need to make an effort,\" he jokes.The \"you\" in this instance are the BBC cameras that have been following Hoy and his family and friends for the past 12 months for the documentary Sir Chris Hoy: Cancer, Courage and Me.The programme will be broadcast for the first time at 21:00 GMT on Thursday, 18 December on BBC One and available from 22:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.It shows a hopeful, yet raw, portrayal of the realities of living with stage four cancer, while it also brings to life Hoy's realisation that he can use his platform as a force for raising awareness, and money, for other people living with the illness.As he weighs his coffee – perhaps the number one area where Hoy's obsessive eye for detail manifests itself – the Scot is in an upbeat mood, laughing and joking with wife Sarra about their imagined usual morning scenario of a full English breakfast compared to the omelette and green homemade smoothie they are actually tucking into.It has not been anywhere near this rosy for much of the past two years, however, as Hoy explains a few minutes later when the cameras are rolling properly.\"It's about five miles from the hospital back home,\" he says, describing his return journey from seeing doctors after learning of his cancer diagnosis in September 2023. \"I just walked back in a daze. I don't remember the walk. I was just thinking, how am I going to tell Sarra? What am I going to say?\"As soon as I said the words, I broke down.\"What Hoy had to articulate was a terminal cancer diagnosis. Incurable secondary bone cancer. Between two and four years to live.\"In my sporting career it used to be about process, not outcome,\" he says. \"Focus on what you have control over. But if you win or lose, it's not life and death.\"[After the diagnosis] the stakes have changed dramatically. The principle is the same – but now it is life and death.\"Hoy has shrewdly taken on support for this difficult time in his life.Steve Peters is a man that Hoy knew could make a difference.The list of sportspeople that Peters has worked with - the public list he is happy to talk about on the record - is a high-profile 'who's who' ranging from Steven Gerrard to Ronnie O'Sullivan.The donkeys in the front paddock of the psychiatrist's countryside home bely that glitzy, glamourous list.But their tranquil nature make complete sense when you spend a few hours in the company of Peters and Hoy.Peters was Hoy's first port of call throughout his career when it came to training and calming his mind to be at its peak in and around Olympic competition.He was also one of the first people Hoy called when he got his terminal diagnosis last year.At first Peters was part of the firefighting phase of what Hoy's wife Sarra describes as a \"deep grief\" in the first few days post-diagnosis.But in time, with Peters' help, Hoy set about finding a new purpose.Firstly, it is to raise awareness of the limitations of the current provision for prostate cancer in the UK. Both Hoy's father and grandfather have had prostate cancer.Understandably, given an earlier diagnosis could have shifted his diagnosis from terminal to manageable, the 49-year-old Scot argues eloquently that a national screening programme should be made a priority for men from their 45th birthday onwards.But, crucially, his approach is also to show other people living with cancer that sport and exercise can still be a positive part of their lives, even through their treatment.Peters explains: \"What Chris did when he was presented with this illness is he said: 'Right, what's the plan?' After we worked through the initial stages of the shock and grief of it, then he came out the other side and he picked up on the purpose.\"And that was to reach other people. It became a mission for him.\"Peters knows all too well how unstoppable Hoy can be when a mission takes him over.The pair have now worked together for more than 20 years, with perhaps their crowning moment coming at the Athens 2004 Games.It was in the Greek capital that Peters' \"pink elephant\" technique helped Hoy win his first Olympic gold. In the run-up to Athens, Peters had encouraged Hoy to pre-empt a scenario in which his rivals broke the world record in the men's kilometre time trial before the Scot had his chance to ride. The scenario became reality on three occasions, but rather than falter, Hoy, the last to ride, responded with a world record of his own to take gold.The mindset of that moment is one he is tapping into again with his approach to cancer. Control the controllables, but don't waste time worrying about the end result.Just like in Athens.\"As I went to the start line, a personal best would have got me third,\" Hoy remembers.\"Recognising what you have control over is such an important part of life. Focus on what you have control over - but the outcome itself, you don't have control over.\"Steve helped me to access the best of myself, and get the best out of myself.\"The BBC Breakfast and BBC Sport cameras witnessed Hoy, with the help of Lady Sarra - who herself is dealing with her own diagnosis of multiple sclerosis - making the best of his cancer diagnosis in the last 12 months.They have followed Hoy and his family to doctor and physio appointments and out on mountain bike rides in Wales with a GB Olympic cycling A-list group of riders and friends.That same cast list turned out in Glasgow in September as Hoy and a host of his supporters took his cycling fundraising event the Tour de Four from concept to delivery inside a few months.'Overwhelming' response to Hoy missionIt is just after 9am in a back room of the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow – a few minutes before Hoy's charity mass participation cycling event, the Tour de Four, is due to get under way.The ride was set up, and given its title, in an effort to change perceptions around stage four cancer.Every time the door opens, a member of British Olympic and Paralympic royalty walks through it.Sir Mark Cavendish, Sir Jason Kenny, Becky James, Dani King, Sir Ben Ainslie, Sir Steve Redgrave, Dame Sarah Storey...In and among the clip-clop of cycling cleats comes another sporting knight.This one is wearing tennis shoes.Hoy goes over to check in with Sir Andy Murray about his readiness and is met with a typical sardonic quip from his fellow Scot.Hoy asks: \"Are you feeling ready mate?\"\"Well, I've got the kit,\" Murray responds.As it turns out, the two-time Wimbledon champion was woefully ill-prepared – completing the ride in tennis shoes and boxer shorts. Not typical road cycling gear, but typical of the response of Hoy's friends to his diagnosis.\"The response of friends has been quite overwhelming at times,\" Hoy says.The friend response has been mirrored by that of the public.September's Tour de Four raised more than £3m for cancer charities across the UK.However, the highs of that success were followed in November by the UK National Screening Committee's recommendation that a prostate screening cancer programme for all men in the UK was not justified.For Hoy, the fight to raise money and raise awareness is his new Olympic-sized mission and his response therefore was dignified, yet resolutely determined.\"I was quite astonished,\" he said. \"I can't believe that the answer to this situation is to sit on your hands and do nothing. There are 10,000 men a year in the UK who find out they have prostate cancer too late – it's incurable.\"We're failing these men if we don't do something proactive. Regardless, I'm going to keep pushing.\"Again, we meet his Olympic-honed mindset, targeted on a bigger mission.\"The Olympics was something that was my life for so many years and drove me on,\" Hoy says.\"I'm still incredibly proud of it now and I look back with great fondness, but this is something on an entirely different level.\"It's more important than riding bikes in anti-clockwise circles, put it that way.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterFifa will finally release its much-anticipated return to video games in 2026, several years after its acrimonious split with developer EA.But it is Netflix, rather than a major game studio, which has secured the rights to the upcoming football game.Once one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, issues including a costly licence prompted Fifa's previous publisher Electronic Arts to stop using the name in 2023 - instead naming its best-selling game EA Sports FC.Netflix said the new Fifa would be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - which has yet to release a video game - and released ahead of the 2026 World Cup.It said subscribers will be able to play online via the Netflix app on iOS and Android devices - or on select TVs by using their phone as the controller.EA Sports released the first Fifa game in 1993, and ran the franchise for 30 years until moving away from the branding to create its own.The series was estimated to have around 150 million players.But the renamed game still connected with fans - with EA FC 24 being the best-selling game in the UK in 2023.Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football governing body was \"very excited\" to team up with Netflix Games ahead of the World Cup in 2026.\"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football,\" he said. \"It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for Fifa.\"California-based Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the game, is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on a new James Bond title, 007: First Light.The firm's boss Casper Daugaard said as \"lifelong Fifa fans\" it wanted to make the game \"the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created\".Reaction to the announcement has so far been mixed, with some fans questioning whether the mobile-first focus from Netflix was the way forward for the franchise.\"FIFA should never have left EA,\" said one person on social media site X. \"Let's see what the new game's got.\"",

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will crack down on hate speech following Sunday's deadly shooting at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival.Fifteen people were killed when two gunmen opened fire at an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.New laws will target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\", Albanese told reporters in Canberra. The home affairs minister will also be given new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate and a new taskforce will be set up to ensure the education system \"prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism\".The new laws will also include penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence, a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\", and the introduction of \"hate\" as an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment.\"Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation,\" Albanese said.\"The terrorists, inspired by ISIS... sought to turn Australians against each other. Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"Albanese added that his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations put forward in July in a report by antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference. She said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\".\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. \"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoThere is a mix of stories on the front pages of Thursday's papers. Leading the Metro, the prime minister says the UK will sue former Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich unless he gives victims of the war in Ukraine the £2.5bn he made from the sale of the club. The Russian billionaire pledged in 2022 to donate the funds to benefit victims of the war, but there has been a delay in releasing the money, which is currently frozen in a British bank account, due to a standoff over how exactly it should be used.\"Abramovich clings on to $2.5bn\" is the Times' take. The paper says the Russian billionaire believes he has \"a watertight legal case\" to ensure the funds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club are donated on his terms. Alongside, police are vowing to crack down on chants for intifada, an Arabic word for uprising, by pro-Palestinian supporters, saying they will \"act decisively\" over use of the slogan, the Times reports.The UK's deal to rejoin the EU student exchange programme, Erasmus, could cost more than £8bn, according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper says the ongoing membership is set to be a lot pricier than the government previously announced because of Brussels' plans to increase funding for the scheme from 2028. Elsewhere, the Matt cartoon eyes the doctors' strike in the week before Christmas, showing a nurse telling a patient: \"Only four more sleeps till you get a visit from a resident doctor.\" The Daily Mail also stays with the Erasmus deal, quoting critics of the PM who accuse him of \"throwing billions away\" on the scheme. Sir Keir's ministers defended the decision, saying it would \"provide priceless benefits\" to students hoping to study abroad.The Financial Times leads with the continued bidding war between Paramount and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery. The paper reports Warner Bro Discovery's board is urging shareholders to reject Paramount's $108bn offer, calling it \"inferior\" to the terms agreed with Netflix. In the top picture spot, panda diplomacy is \"bearing the brunt\" of the political rift between China and Japan. For the first time in more than half a century, a panda at the Toyko zoo due to be returned to China in January will not be replaced by a new furry resident, the paper says. The UK military has begun \"advanced preparations\" to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine, the i Paper reports. Officials are hopeful that a peace deal is \"closer than ever\" and the Ministry of Defence has begun its \"notice to move\" process to deploy troops if called upon, the paper says.The Daily Express shifts its focus to the doctors' strike. The paper features Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch calling on the PM to \"show some backbone\" and ban doctors from striking. She also accuses the government of \"failing patients\" as the NHS struggles to cope with the walkouts, the paper says.The Guardian also marks the doctors' strike with their front page picture of resident doctors picketing outside St Thomas' hospital in London. Also prominent is the paper's story on Belgian politicians and senior finance executives being subject to a \"campaign of intimidation\" allegedly orchestrated by Russian intelligence.The Daily Mirror spotlights the news that scientists who helped find the first drug to fight Covid have now joined the search for treatment of the super flu that is bearing down on the NHS. The paper quotes one of the leaders of the Recovery trial as saying: \"We have got more treatments for Covid than flu.\"Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola's restaurant is shutting down, says the Sun. The team behind the venue blames the closure on \"exceptionally challenging\" trading conditions and increased costs, according to the paper.Finally, the Daily Star splashes with plans by German darts fans to take over the World Championships next year as the event moves to a bigger arena at Alexandra Palace. \"Herr we throw\" is the headline.The Daily Telegraph says the UK could face a bill of almost £9bn for rejoining the EU's student exchange programme, Erasmus. The government has agreed a deal for one year, but the paper says ongoing membership would be far more expensive, as the EU plans to significantly increase the cost. A government spokesperson says the £570m agreement for 2027 is a \"good deal\" for taxpayers.The Daily Mail has a different figure of £6bn, asserting in its front page headline that was the cost of what it calls Sir Keir Starmer's \"new bid to suck up to Brussels\".  It quotes the shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, accusing Labour of \"throwing millions away\".  In response, the minister for EU relations, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says rejoining the Erasmus scheme is a \"huge win for young people\".The Guardian says it has been told by European intelligence agencies that the Kremlin has been orchestrating a campaign of intimidation against Belgian politicians and finance executives. It says the campaign is aimed at stopping the country un-freezing billions of pounds of Russian assets and using them to help Ukraine.According to the i Paper, the British military has been preparing to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine as hopes rise that a deal to end the war with Russia is imminent. The newspaper says kit is being bought and plans for troop movements are being finalised.A call by Kemi Badenoch, for Sir Keir to \"show some backbone\" and ban doctors from striking is highlighted by the Daily Express.  Writing in the paper, Badenoch says her party would legislate to prevent doctors staging walkouts. The Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, is quoted as saying he tried his \"absolute best\" to avoid the industrial action.And the Times reports that the government has put an export ban on a 220-year-old Union flag, flown at the Battle of Trafalgar, to prevent it being purchased by an overseas buyer. The paper says it is hoped the three-month ban will give a gallery or museum time to raise the £450,000 needed so it can be kept for the nation.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington andAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondentUS President Donald Trump has announced a $1,776 (£1,329) \"warrior dividend\" payment to 1.45 million US servicemembers - paid for, in part, by his tariffs.In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday night, Trump said \"cheques are already on the way\" and should arrive before Christmas.In the address, Trump touted his record on the economy and immigration while railing against Democrats.With a forceful delivery, he seemed determined to convince Americans that the country was doing well - and things would only get better, including claiming that prices are falling, at a time when polls show that many Americans are unhappy about the cost of housing, childcare and healthcare.In the brief, 18-minute address, Trump said that the \"warrior dividend\", which totals $2.57bn (£1.9bn), will be distributed \"in honour of our nation's founding in 1776\". Trump added that the funds were drawn from his sweeping tariffs, as well as the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" that he signed into law on 4 July. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military,\" he said. The president offered little new information in the speech, and some of his assertions were either exaggerated or unfounded. Much of Trump's address focused on his economic record and the administration's efforts to bring down prices - which he blamed on former US President Joe Biden and the Democrats. Trump mentioned the former president seven times.\"Now, under our leadership, they [prices] are all coming down and coming down fast,\" he said. \"Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring, but we are solving that too.\" While fuel and egg prices have indeed fallen, many other food items are more expensive. Economic data from September shows the US inflation rate hit 3% for the first time since January, while consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since April due to concerns over the cost of living, jobs and the wider economy.Trump has previously acknowledged that concerns over rising prices have contributed to a lacklustre Republican performance in the November elections, with the Democrats having success in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, as well as more recently in Miami and Georgia. He has also acknowledged that incumbent presidents and their parties often fare poorly in midterm elections, which will take place next year. The White House has since been wrestling with how to address voter concerns about the economy, while at the same time pushing back on repeated Democratic criticism over rising prices.The political dilemma faced by the Trump administration has been highlighted by recent polling. One poll, from Politico, showed that about half of overall voters - and 4 in 10 people who voted for Trump in 2024 - felt the cost of living was the worst it has been in their lives.Another poll released in November by CBS News/YouGov suggested that Trump's approval on economic issues has dropped 15 points since March, with 36% of Americans approving his handling of the issue. More broadly, other polls show that Trump is at or near the lowest approval ratings of his second term, with concerns about the economy playing a significant role. While the president offered little in the way of empathy over prices, he did point to Republican efforts – such as tax reform legislation passed earlier this year – that will benefit many Americans in the coming year.When he ran for re-election last year, Trump promised immediate results. And after 11 months in office, many Americans say they still haven't seen substantive change, and the president's speech might be unlikely to change their minds. Trump, in part, focused his remarks on the promise of improvements during 250th birthday celebrations for American's founding next year. \"When the world looks at us next year, let them see a nation that is loyal to its citizens, faithful to its workers, confident to its identity, certain to its destiny, and the envy of the entire globe,\" he said.\"We are respected again, like we have never been respected before,\" he added.

    "body": "8 hours agoLucy CarlinBBC News NIBBCJayla Boyd worked part time in JD while studying for her A-LevelsA student who worked as a sales assistant has settled a sexual harassment case against her former employer JD Sports for £65,000. Jayla Boyd worked part time in a Belfast store while studying for her A-levels. During a shift, Ms Boyd, who was 17 at the time, was slapped on the bottom by a male supervisor and was upset that her employer failed to offer her support after the incident.In settling the case, JD Sports Fashion PLC acknowledged and apologised for the significant upset to Ms Boyd. It also agreed to liaise with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI), who supported the case, to review its policies.Muscle memoryA JD Sports Fashion plc spokesperson said the individual involved is no longer employed by the company.In a statement the company said: \"This incident occurred in July 2024 and was promptly addressed in line with our policies.\"They also apologised to Ms Boyd.Following the incident, on the same day, Ms Boyd made a report to her manager and was told that CCTV had captured the incident. However, the supervisor was allowed to continue to work alongside her for the rest of the shift. She said he approached her twice during that time to talk to her and apologised for what he had done, explaining that it was \"muscle memory\".Despite raising a complaint of sexual harassment, Ms Boyd claimed that while she made a written statement, she was not formally interviewed about her experience. She said she felt upset and distressed that her employer failed to offer her support after the incident, so she used some annual leave to take time away from her job.Upon her return, she said no return-to-work meeting was arranged. ReutersJD Sports Fashion PLC has agreed to liaise with the Equality Commission to review its policies, practices and proceduresMs Boyd said she was not updated about the investigation or outcome of her complaint. \"I didn't really ever hear much, I didn't want to ask because I thought it was standard procedure that I was kept out of an investigation... I learned that wasn't really standard procedure and I should have been involved,\" Ms Boyd told BBC News NI. She also believes that her personal information relating to the incident was seen by other staff on a manager's computer.Ms Boyd experienced further embarrassment during a staff training session when an example involving a woman being slapped on the bottom by a supervisor was discussed. She felt certain the example referred to her own experience. Ms Boyd later resigned from her job.'I never expected this to happen to me'\"I never expected this to happen to me. The initial incident was embarrassing, but it was made worse because I felt like they were trying to ignore what had happened to me instead of dealing with it properly,\" Ms Boyd said.\"I had to remain working with this male supervisor after he had sexually harassed me. Everyone deserves to feel safe and supported at work. \"It took me a long time to understand that it was really serious and I think that came from the stigma around it, I was so worried about what other people thought... because of how people would see me... but now I am so glad I said something,\" she continued.\"I hope that by speaking out I can give others the confidence to challenge this type of behaviour.\"Zero-tolerance approachIn a statement, Chief Commissioner Geraldine McGahey said a \"zero-tolerance approach\" by employers to sexual harassment in the workplace \"will remind everyone how seriously it will be dealt with should any instances arise\". \"In order to prevent it, employers must ensure that all staff know what behaviour is acceptable, and unacceptable, in the workplace,\" she added.\"Employers must have clear policies and procedures in place to deal with harassment, and managers must be trained to use them appropriately. This type of behaviour must be investigated thoroughly, with the complaint dealt with sensitively and in a timely manner.\"In settling the case, ECNI said JD Sports Fashion PLC \"acknowledged and apologised for the significant upset, distress, and injury to feelings experienced by Ms Boyd\". The company reaffirmed its strong commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity. It has also agreed to liaise with the commission to review its policies, practices and procedures, the ECNI added.",

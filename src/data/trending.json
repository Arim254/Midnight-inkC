Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "1 hour agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze.Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts.One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall.Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday \"the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\".A senior police official told the BBC that the authorities had been unable to search the building for bodies as the fire has continued to burn. More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said she was confident disagreements with campaigners over a new law designed to stop cover-ups can be resolved before it returns to Parliament on Monday.The Hillsborough Law would introduce a legal obligation for public authorities to co-operate and tell the truth in inquiries.However, bereaved families and some Labour MPs have raised concerns the heads of security services would be able to exempt MI5 and MI6 officers from disclosing information.Nandy insisted security services would not be exempt from the legislation but told the BBC that the challenge was also ensuring officers, who often held confidential information, could continue to do their jobs.The draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, would place the same \"duty of candour\" on security service personnel as other public servants.However, under a change proposed by the government, this would be subject to the approval of the head of their service.Campaigners have argued this would allow those running security services to decide whether to disclose information and said they could not support the bill in its current form.Elkan Abrahamson, a lawyer for the Hillsborough Law Now campaign, said it would leave them \"unchallengeable\".He said it should be up to the head of an inquiry to decide whether information was relevant, adding that there were already national security exemptions allowing for evidence to be heard in private.Families bereaved by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack have also called for the law to apply fully to security services.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds.On Saturday, the Labour mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotherham, said the government's proposal on the security services created \"too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation\".The government is facing the prospect of a rebellion by some of its own MPs on Monday, when the House of Commons is due to vote on the legislation.Asked if the government would be able to do a deal with campaigners before the vote, Nandy told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"I think we're going to be able to find a way to resolve it. I'm really confident about that.\"She added that the government was listening to families and \"we will find a way to get this right because in the end we want the same thing\".Challenged over whether the government was watering down the legislation, Nandy said: \"The security services won't be exempt but there is a challenge that we've got collectively.\"She said that this challenge was \"to make sure that this [law] applies to the security services, without fear or favour\" such that \"they can continue to do their jobs\" as \"the recipients of confidential information\".But also \"that we never ever end up in a situation like we did with the Manchester Arena inquiry... where the security services are able to withhold information and present an inaccurate picture to families and to a public inquiry for a very long time\".The Labour mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin said it was \"vital\" security services were subject to the duty of candour.She told the programme the government was \"95% there\" but \"without the trust and confidence of the families it's going to be very difficult\".On Friday, government sources told the BBC that, while they had the the deepest respect for bereaved families, they had gone as far as they could without compromising national security.Around 30 Labour MPs have backed a proposal by Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne that would ensure the duty of candour applies in full to individuals working for security services.Byrne - a longstanding campaigner for the law - has said he could not support it in its current form.Another Liverpool MP, Anneliese Midgeley, has accused the government of breaking its promises to Hillsborough families and urged ministers to change course.The Hillsborough Law follows campaigning by families affected by the 1989 stadium crush in Sheffield, which led to the death of 97 football fans.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about the disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.",

    "body": "Syrian troops fighting Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria have seized the country's largest oilfield.The Omar facility and nearby gas fields are under army control after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) pulled back, officials and monitors say. Earlier the army captured the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.The push came after the SDF announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates, following deadly clashes last week. That withdrawal followed talks with US officials.Ongoing fighting in the area stems from the breakdown of an agreement between SDF and the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is seeking to integrate Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.On Friday, in an apparent good-will gesture, al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language and make the Kurdish new year an official holiday. The decree is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.The US-backed SDF then announced its pullout east of the Euphrates river. Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.Over the weekend, Syrian troops continued their eastward push. They entered the town of Tabqa on the south-western bank of the Euphrates and nearby dam on Saturday.On Sunday, Syrian officials announced they had seized Omar, Syria's largest oil field, on the eastern side of the river. The facility has been a major source of revenue for the SDF.This claim was supported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. It said the SDF had withdrawn from \"entire villages and towns of the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor [province]\" as well as the Omar and Tanak oil fields early on Sunday.Meanwhile Syrian authorities accused the SDF of blowing up two bridges on the Euphrates River, including the new al-Rashid bridge in the city of Raqqa.Last week at least 12 people were reported killed in clashes between the two sides in the northern city of Aleppo.The latest fighting comes despite attempts by the US to broker a ceasefire. Washington has long backed the SDF, but it also supports the Syrian government.Following the ousting of longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate Kurdish military and civilian bodies into Syria's national institutions.In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each side blaming the other.",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US president Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely-used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

There were also times during the pandemic when he was not allowed into the ground.Waites said he still remembered when he got to 1,000 games in 2016 and his friends told him it was \"time to pack in the addiction\".\"A few people at the time threatened to kidnap me for a game,\" Waites said.\"It will come to an end, it's got to come to an end.\"I often wonder how will it end, you know, will we get stuck in a traffic jam somewhere, or a train delay or whatever?\"But yeah, we just roll on.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterEPANigel Farage has insisted Reform UK will not become the Conservative Party 2.0 following the defection of former senior Tory Robert Jenrick.The party's leader wrote in the Telegraph that Reform was \"not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP\" and any potential defectors would have to be prepared to admit publicly that the previous Conservative government \"broke the country\".Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC that Jenrick was \"a great new asset\" who brought ministerial experience.However, with around 20 former Conservative MPs joining the party in recent months, critics have argued Reform is becoming a home for failed Tories rather than a new force in British politics.Farage has said his party will not accept any more defectors after local elections are held on 7 May.\"Any Conservative MP who still clings to the hope that their party can recover and waits until May 8 to try to leave the sinking ship does not understand how rapidly things are changing out in the country,\" he wrote in the Telegraph.\"Trying to use Reform as a lifeboat to save their own political skins will not wash. We have no interest in rescuing political failures.\"He said any defectors would have to bring some benefits to the party and \"truly believe in Reform's fundamental values of family, community and country\".Senior Conservatives believe some other MPs could also defect, though they are not expecting a big wave of departures imminently.Reform has also said a \"well-known Labour figure\" will defect to the party next week.Former Labour MP and Brexit campaigner Baroness Kate Hoey, who has sat as a non-affiliated peer since 2020, is among those rumoured to be a possible defector.Asked if she could join Reform, Tice - who stood in for Farage due to illness - told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Baroness Hoey was \"a wonderful person\" and \"a good friend\" but refused to confirm whether she would defect.Baroness Hoey has not said whether she plans to defect or not, but told Sky News she had not been a Labour member for more than eight years and was \"not sure I'm that well-known\".Some commentators have suggested senior Tory defectors could prompt power struggles within Reform, with Jenrick touted as a possible shadow chancellor, along with Tice and Reform's head of policy Zia Yusuf.Asked if he would be happy to see Jenrick as shadow chancellor, Tice said the party had \"a great range of talent\" and Farage would \"make his decision about different roles at the appropriate time\".Robert Jenrick is 'a great new asset to Reform' says TiceJenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after he was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet for plotting to defect.As a former immigration, housing and health minister, Jenrick brings government experience to Reform.However, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"Bringing in Robert Jenrick, who presided over soaring NHS waiting lists and the collapse of the criminal justice system in this country, to solve the problems this country faces is like calling out the arsonists to put out the fire.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed her party was stronger and more united since Jenrick left, saying he was not \"a team player\".",

Born in 1921 in Dundee, Scotland, she lived through World War Two and was an active member of the Land Army during that time.Home manager Hannah Nurse said it had been \"wonderful\" to mark her great age.The centenarian enjoyed her birthday surrounded by friends and family at the home, with a special cake prepared by the sous chef, Kieran Lister.\"Spending the day with my whole family and enjoying a lovely afternoon tea party with plenty of bubbles made it especially memorable,\" she said.Recalling her long life, she said she remembered sneaking out to meet her future husband Alfred, who she married in 1944.After the war, she spent time raising her two children and later worked at her local store after moving to Yorkshire.She still continues to enjoy baking, knitting and tapestry-making at the care home. \"We were so excited to celebrate such a joyous day with Elizabeth,\" Nurse said.\"As a much-loved resident at Kentford Manor, it was wonderful to mark this tremendous milestone with her and her family.\"",

    "body": "'Young 40s': Gen Z has found a new way to mock millennials for their style in South Korea17 hours agoHyojung KimBBC KoreanInstagram/@detailanceJi says he has become more self-conscious interacting with younger colleaguesJi Seung-ryeol, 41, prides himself on his sense of fashion. He diligently shares mirror selfies on Instagram, where everyone knows the more likes you get, the cooler you are.  So he was bewildered to find out that men his age have become the subject of ridicule online, mocked for shoehorning their way into styles associated with Gen Z and younger millennials.AI-generated caricatures of this demographic have gone viral on social media: a middle-aged man decked out in street wear and clutching an iPhone. The kids call them \"Young 40s\".The memes have made Ji's beloved Nike Air Jordans and Stüssy T-shirts the butt of jokes—and the source of much indignation.\"I'm just buying and wearing things I've liked for a long time, now that I can afford them,\" he tells the BBC. \"Why is this something to be attacked for?\"The iPhone that started it allOnce celebrated as pioneers of taste in the 1990s, the tide of public opinion on 40-year-olds turned after the release of the iPhone 17 last September.The smartphone, long considered the preserve of the youth, was suddenly recast as a tacky trademark of Young 40s. These are, in the words of Gen Z Jeong Ju-eun, people \"trying too hard to look young\", who \"refuse to accept that time has passed\".The figures seem to reflect this shift. While the majority of young South Koreans still prefer the iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy, over the past year Apple's market share fell by 4% among Gen Z consumers and rose 12% for people in their 40s, according to research by Gallup.Something similar played out a few years back with Geriatric Millennials, born in the early '80s, whose brand of humour—the crying-laughing emoji, finger moustaches and the word \"adulting\"—was derided as cringey.Back then, debate over Geriatric Millennials sparked self-deprecating jokes, think pieces and quizzes dictating if you're meant to pile on the ribbing or be subjected to it.The same trends have taken hold in South Korea with Young 40s.News1The iPhone, long considered the preserve of young people, is now seen as a trademark of Young 40sIn Korea, age difference, even by a year, forms the basis of social hierarchy. Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.A self-conscious sandwich generationPopularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities. They were health-conscious, active and comfortable with technology—an important target demographic for companies.\"In the past, people in their 40s were seen as already old,\" says Kim Yong-Sup, a trend analyst widely credited with coining the term \"Young 40\".As the median age of South Korea's society rose, however, these people were \"no longer on the verge of old age but at the centre of society\", he says.But the marketing term has since taken a viral, sardonic turn. Over the past year, \"Young 40\" was mentioned online more than 100,000 times - more than half the references were used in a negative context, according to analytics platform SomeTrend. Many of them appeared alongside words like \"old\" and \"disgusting\".An offshoot of the meme is Sweet Young 40, a sarcastic label for middle-aged men who like to hit on young women.Getty ImagesMany South Korean youth face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job marketSome see the jokes about Young 40s as a form of punching up: these are people at the peak of their careers, who amassed wealth in a time of economic stability and a property boom.On the other side are Gen Z and young millennials, born a couple of decades later, who face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job market. In their eyes, Young 40s represent \"the generation that made it through just before the door of opportunity closed\", according to psychologist Oh Eun-kyung.\"They are seen not simply as individuals with personal tastes, but as symbols of privilege and power,\" she says. \"That's why the energy of mockery is focused on them.\"But Ji, the 41-year-old fashion enthusiast who lived through the so-called golden era, tells a different version of that story.After experiencing the Asian financial crisis as a teen, Ji entered a tough job market in his 20s, submitting around 60-70 applications to land a job. His generation is one that \"had very little to enjoy growing up, and only began to enjoy things later, as adults\", he says.Instagram/@detailanceJi says he feels \"caught in between\" two generationsNow at the workplace, he often finds himself sandwiched between two worlds. The generation above him ran a \"strict, top-down system where you did what you were told\", while below him is \"a generation that asks 'why''\".\"We're a generation that has experienced both cultures. We feel caught in between.\"While the ability to straddle two generations was once a badge of honour, Ji says he has become self-conscious about interacting with younger colleagues for fear of being labelled a kkondae or Young 40.\"These days, I hardly organise drinking gatherings,\" he says. \"I try to keep conversations focused on work or career concerns, and only share personal stories when discussions naturally deepen.\"According to Kang, another fashionable 41-year-old, sitting at the heart of the Young 40 meme is a deeply human desire.\"As you get older, longing for youth becomes completely natural. Wanting to look young is something every generation shares.\"",

    "body": "5 days agoWedaeli ChibelushiAPP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAcross North Africa, the Amazigh people have been coming together to usher in the year 2976.They have, unfortunately, not cracked time travel. Rather, they are almost a thousand years ahead of much of the world because they follow a calendar that starts at 950 BC, when King Sheshonq ascended the throne of Egypt.The Amazigh new year, known as Yennayer, begins between 12 and 14 January - depending on the area in which they live in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya - so over the last few days families have been laying on huge feasts, lighting bonfires and playing traditional music. Calls of \"aseggas ameggaz\", or happy new year, have been ringing through villages and busy city streets, while vibrant, meticulously embroidered traditional clothing has been donned for the occasion.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAmazigh culture and language has gained greater recognition over the past decadeThe Amazigh (which means \"free people\" or \"noble people\") are a range of ethnic groups that are North Africa's original inhabitants, having occupied the region since the beginning of recorded history.The exact size of the population is not known because of a dearth of official statistics, but according to estimates there are tens of millions of Amazigh people living across North Africa. Algeria and Morocco have the biggest populations - the latter is thought to be 40% Amazigh.Yennayer centres on family gatherings, celebrating renewal and the deep connection the Amazigh people have traditionally had with nature.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThese days Yennayer is marked with parades, concerts and carnivalsBecause the Amazigh are a diverse group, traditional Yennayer food differs from country to country and area to area. In Morocco's High Atlas region, \"ourkemen\", a rich mixture of legumes, spices and whole grains, is a new year's favourite.Many families in Algeria enjoy \"trèze\", a combination of sweets, dried fruit and nuts, after the main meal. The snack mix is sometimes gently thrown over the youngest child in a symbol of prosperity.But Yennayer is not just a family thing. It can also be celebrated with the wider community - parades, concerts and carnivals take the new year's spirit out on to the streets.Such proud displays of Amazigh culture are particularly significant as the community has a long history of being marginalised.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesFood, including couscous, is an important aspect of the new year celebrationsIn the 7th Century, as Arab conquerors swept across North Africa, they brought with them their language and the Islamic religion.Both of these were adopted officially, at the expense of Amazigh languages and culture.For instance, during Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's rule of Libya, the Amazigh language Tamazight was banned in schools and parents were not even allowed to give their children Amazigh names.However, thanks to the dogged campaigning of Amazigh activists, their culture and language has seen greater recognition over the past decade.In 2011, Morocco recognised Tamazight as an official language. Both Algeria and Morocco also declared Yennayer a public holiday, in 2017 and 2023 respectively.So Yennayer marks not just a victory for the Amazigh people, but also a reminder of centuries-long fight that has got the community to where it is now - in 2976.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesYennayer is now a public holiday in Algeria and MoroccoGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

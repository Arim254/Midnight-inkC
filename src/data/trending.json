    "body": "With most of the UK now fully in the grip of Arctic winds, a number of areas awoke to a covering of snow on Friday morning, all the way from Shetland to the south coast of England.The sleet and snow showers that moved southwards across the country on Thursday night created a visual treat for our BBC WeatherWatchers, but also meant slippery roads and pavements for those venturing out.The Met Office issued several weather warnings for snow and ice, with amber warnings for snow in effect from lunchtime on Friday for parts of northern Scotland.The frigid conditions are set to persist into next week, but while further snow showers are possible for some, this weekend will be dry and sunny by day for the vast majority. Nights will become much colder though, with temperatures possibly dropping to minus double digits on Saturday night in a few locations in Scotland and northern England.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMick LunneyYorkshireMaisy Creed RacingMaisy was crowned karting's PF International X30 Junior Champion 2025 in NovemberA teenager from Sheffield has said she aims to become a top F1 driver in the footsteps of the sport's biggest names after being crowned a champion in the sport of karting.Maisy Creed, 16, took the prestigious PF International X30 Junior Champion title in November, becoming the first ever female driver to do so.The title was previously won by future stars such as Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Lando Norris, and Maisy said she was determined to win a place in the renowned F1 Academy so she could follow a similar path.\"I'm there with all the guys, the only female driver there, and it just feels really special. I've done something nobody else has done - and that feels special,\" she said.Maisy said that later this year she would use facilities at Silverstone, the legendary home of the British Grand Prix and MotoGP events, to develop her driving skills in cars.The aim was to impress the F1 Academy with her performance data and, if she succeeded, it could see her achieving her academy goal in 2027, she explained.Maisy Creed RacingFemale drivers are few and far between at the higher end of the sportMaisy began her racing adventures with indoor karting at the age of eight, later than most drivers who rise in the outdoors version of the sport.Her dad, Adam, said he was very proud of his daughter's achievements so far - and knew she could succeed in her goals despite the fact it was \"a massively male-dominated sport\".\"For girls to come into that sport and excel, it's unbelievably difficult,\" Mr Creed said.Maisy agreed and said there was unfortunately still a lot of sexism faced by females in the sport.\"There's a few girls that I'm quite close with, and we all experience it,\" she said.\"It's just really annoying to deal with because I don't understand why they [males] find it so unbelievable, and they really just don't want to be beaten by me.\"'Passion and desire'Maisy said she realised she was \"fairly unusual\".\"I'm one of a tiny handful of girls on the whole planet that can actually compete at the top level against the boys and actually be at the front,\" she said.However, Maisy added that she believed she was on track for further success in 2026 and beyond.\"I have the passion and desire to reach for the very top of this amazing sport that I love,\" she smiled.\"I can't wait to experience the journey over the next five years.\"More stories like thisRelated internet links",

    "body": "A coroner has warned that further babies could die unless the government introduces regulation of non-therapeutic male circumcision following the death of a six-month-old boy in west London.Non-therapeutic circumcision is the removal of the foreskin of male babies and young children for religious or cultural reasons, rather than medical reasons.Mohamed Abdisamad was circumcised on 12 February 2023, by a circumciser who had been recommended to his parents and requested by them to perform the procedure on their son, the West London Coroner's report said.The baby began showing symptoms of illness three to four days later and was taken to hospital on 19 February and died the same day.He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital by ambulance where he went into cardiorespiratory arrest and was pronounced dead at 23:55 GMT.A jury inquest which concluded on 8 October 2025 found the medical cause of death to be an \"invasive streptococcus pyogenes infection following male circumcision\".Assistant coroner Anton van Dellen wrote a prevention of future deaths report in which he called for action over the lack of safety and regulatory measures surrounding non-therapeutic male circumcisions.\"During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern,\" Dr van Dellen wrote in the report dated December 28 2025.\"In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.\"The coroner said there are no national safeguards governing non-therapeutic male circumcision, with no requirements for training, accreditation or registration of those carrying out the procedure, and no rules on record keeping, infection control or aftercare.He also pointed to the lack of a system for obtaining consent prior to the procedure being carried out.The report is being sent to the Department of Health and Social Care, and to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.They have 56 days from the date of the report being issued to respond, the coroner said.Copies of the report are also being sent to Mohamed's mother and father, his maternal grandmother, his uncle, and the London Ambulance Service.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoWill JeffordLeicesterLouise GatherMrs Gather said she had not foraged any mushrooms on the day that she was reportedA police officer involved in a controversy sparked by efforts to sanction a woman for  mushroom foraging has been found to have committed gross misconduct.In November 2024, Louise Gather travelled from her home in Derby to Bradgate Park, Leicester in search of magpie inkcaps - a rare kind of fungus.The 39-year-old told the BBC she did not pick any mushrooms, but despite this, former PC Christopher Vickers later attended her property and issued a community resolution order.However, the misconduct panel found he had issued the paperwork to her husband and then lied when updating an official police database - claiming to have spoken directly to Mrs Gather.The panel said he would have been sacked over the incident if he had not already left the force.It was found that Mr Vickers actions had been dishonest, deliberate, and had the potential to damage police confidence.Community resolution orders are an informal agreement between a complainant and an alleged offender, and for it to be valid, it had to be issued to Mrs Gather should have been spoken to directly, accepted responsibility for the offence and signed the paperwork.The report concluded that Mr Vickers did not follow this policy when issuing the resolution.Mrs Gather previously said the order had included agreeing not to take items from the park in the future, and looking into Bradgate Park's status as a designated site of special scientific interest (SSSI).Picking mushrooms is illegal in sites of special scientific interest, which are protected areas of land or water.Police visit over mushroom picking alarms foragerAt the time of the incident Mrs Gather had said she felt the actions of Leicestershire Police had been \"a bit excessive\" - although this was not assessed by the misconduct panel.The hearing, which took place in October, was told the force received a call from Bradgate Park Trust about a woman who was picking mushrooms at their park in Leicester on 8 November 2024.On 25 November, Mr Vickers went to her home address and advised her husband that he would issue a community resolution, an informal agreement between a complainant and an alleged offender.Her husband signed the relevant paperwork before the officer left.Louise GatherLouise Gather had travelled to Bradgate Park in search of magpie inkcaps - a rare kind of fungusPA MediaBradgate Park is protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI)Following the visit, Mr Vickers put an entry on a police system stating that he had spoken to Mrs Gather, that she had admitted to the offence and that she had received the community resolution.In response to the allegation, the former officer accepted his actions, but said he was intending to call Mrs Gather, but had forgotten.Concluding the report, the misconduct committee said Mr Vickers knew his actions did not align with police policy and were done \"for his own convenience\".Following the misconduct hearing, Mrs Gather said: \"I did not personally instigate or pursue a complaint against the officer.\"The Professional Standards Department asked for my version of events after the story was picked up by the press, when they realised that the officer had recorded a crime on my record without evidence or ever speaking to me.\"Leicestershire Police had already apologised, and the charge was removed from my record.\"I had no idea that records had been falsified or that the officer's actions constituted gross misconduct.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "MP abused by trolls loses 10 stone after taking Mounjaro12 hours agoNathan BevanBBC WalesCarolyn HarrisCarolyn Harris went from being a size 24 to a size 10 after taking the slimming drug Mounjaro in late 2024An MP who lost nearly 10 stone on Mounjaro has said people who take unregulated weight-loss jabs are \"playing Russian roulette with their lives\".Labour MP for Neath and Swansea East Carolyn Harris dropped from a size 24 to a size 10 after taking the slimming drug in October 2024 having developed mobility issues.She also said she was fed up with the \"relentless criticism\" about her appearance from online trolls, but has urged others to ensure they use the proper regulated channels for health-related reasons only.\"I made sure I went to a GP to get mine, rather than just go online, because I really wanted to make sure all the correct medical checks were done,\" she added.Harris had private treatment after increasingly struggling to walk around her constituency, which came to a head while walking around a lake in Swansea to celebrate International Menopause Day.\"I started having difficulty and had to stop a quarter of the way in,\" she said.Another motivation was what she called the constant, cruel comments she received online.\"How I looked or what I was wearing had become more import than my politics, \" the 65-year-old told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\"I can be bolshie if I'm fighting for a cause or for someone else, but deep down I'm very sensitive.\"Carolyn HarrisCarolyn Harris, pictured here in June 2024, dropped from a size 24 to a size 10 after using weight loss jabs But Harris said others opting to take weight-loss drugs should do so for health related reasons.The National Pharmacy Association recently voiced concerns about the surge in demand for the likes of Mounjaro or Ozempic and how people were turning to beauty salons or social media to get them.In England, anyone prescribing weight-loss injections must be registered with the Care Quality Commission.But in Wales, only doctors are required to register with the Welsh equivalent, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW), meaning other healthcare professionals are not legally required to meet the same standards or be routinely inspected.Some experts have described this as inadequate regulation, opening up an unsafe black market for such products. \"The people who elect to get these drugs from unlicensed places are playing Russian roulette with their lives,\" said Harris.\"They don't know what they might be injecting into themselves and that terrifies me.\" The Welsh government said weight-loss treatments such as Mounjaro are prescription-only and \"should only be obtained and used in accordance with a prescription from a registered and appropriately trained healthcare professional\".\"No one should purchase prescription only medicines other than from reputable suppliers such as registered pharmacies. Medicines obtained from unregulated sources pose a major risk to people's safety.\"Healthcare professionals prescribing weight-loss treatments must act in accordance with the standards set by the respective professional regulatory bodies,\" they added.More top storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "Will the start of 2026 see a change of fortune for BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton, whose title hopes are fading fast?After Sutton made a strong start to the season, AI has taken charge of the predictions title race, clinching another win last week.\"It's been a bad start to the new year for me, with AI top of the table,\" Sutton said.\"I also lost to my daugher Sophia at cards over Christmas. We played rummy and I think she was cheating - a lot like AI, she was definitely getting some help from somewhere.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 20, he takes on singer-songwriter Andrew Cushin, who is a Newcastle fan.Cushin's second album, Love Is For Everyone, was released last year and reached the top 40. He has toured arenas in Europe and the United States with Louis Tomlinson and also played a sold-out hometown gig at Newcastle's City Hall in October 2025.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, Andrew CushinImage caption, Cushin has been championed by Pete Doherty and Noel Gallagher, who produced and played guitar on his track 'Where's My Family Gone'Alan Shearer was one of Cushin's first heroes, but his idol as a kid was a Toon player who stopped goals, rather than scored them.\"I first went to St James' when I was very young, but my first proper memory was against Stoke in 2008,\" he explained. \"We were 2-0 up at half-time, and I remember being on the concourse at half-time and thinking how great it was to be a Newcastle supporter.\"That didn't last long - we ended up throwing the game away, conceding a couple of late goals and drawing 2-2 - but it was watching Shay Given pull off some big saves that day which made me want to be a keeper.\"Everyone else looked the same, wearing the same shirts, and it was just that one player, the goalkeeper, standing out. You are the last line of defence and you can be the hero, and I always liked that gamble - if it went wrong it was my fault, or I could be the reason why we get the points.\"I was quite keen on that, and then I suppose that transitioned into me being a musician, where it is my name on the poster. I guess I've always liked the attention!\"Cushin's career between the sticks saw him play in the youth team for non-league Newcastle Benfield, but he has had to hang up his gloves to focus on playing the guitar.\"It was a sad day when I had to stop playing, but it came after I'd spent some time in the studio with Noel Gallagher, and I realised I couldn't afford to carry on as a keeper and risk breaking my fingers,\" he added.\"So I always say it was Shay who inspired me to put the gloves on, and Noel who told me to take them off again!\"Chris Sutton and Andrew Cushin were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsSaturday, 3 JanuaryVilla Park, 12:30 GMTNottingham Forest did not have a very good Christmas, losing three games in a row.Sean Dyche's side had plenty of possession against Everton on Tuesday but did not create many chances, and were picked off. That was a bit of a surprise, because of the Toffees' lack of firepower.Forest are lucky West Ham have been so bad, because that is the only reason they still have a bit of breathing space above the bottom three.They travel to play the Hammers on Tuesday, so they may prioritise that game and rest players here - it is that time of year where every squad is stretched.This game is more about how Aston Villa respond to their defeat at Arsenal, because they took a bit of a pasting.I don't think this will be easy for Villa, but I am expecting them to bounce back and win a tight game.I've seen that AI goes for a 2-1 scoreline most of the time and I won't be doing that for every game this week, but I do think that's how this one will end up.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Andrew's prediction: I don't think Villa will fall away after losing to Arsenal. It's sad to see the demise of Forest, who have not been the same side this season, and I can see Villa steamrollering them here. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1Amex Stadium, 15:00I keep backing Brighton to win and keep a clean sheet, which is part of the reason my predictions have been going so badly - they are on a six-game winless run.Burnley's wait for a victory has gone on a lot longer, and they have taken only two points from their past 10 games.I keep saying the Clarets have been competitive, but that is not going to keep them up. Their points tally is what matters, and that means they are bang in trouble.Despite their poor run, I still see the Seagulls as being able to cause anyone problems.They pushed Arsenal close last week and I always think they have a goal in them but, more importantly in terms of how this game might go, they are usually pretty reliable at home.Villa are the only team to have won at the Amex Stadium this season, and I don't see Scott Parker's side getting anything at all on the south coast.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Andrew's prediction: Burnley gave us a good game the other night and this will be close too, but Brighton will have a little bit too much for them. I love Brighton's Yankuba Minteh - he's a brilliant player, and I wish we had never let him leave. 1-0AI's prediction: 3-0Molineux, 15:00Wolves' performance in their draw with Manchester United underlined what I already thought.Yes, they have lost a couple of key players in Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri, but they have still got enough in their squad to have done far better than they have done this season.This is a massive week for West Ham, with their relegation rivals Nottingham Forest up next after this game.The Hammers are looking pretty desperate but their recent away record actually is not too bad - they were well beaten at Manchester City but, before then, they drew three in a row at Bournemouth, Manchester United and Brighton.They probably feel under less pressure when they are on the road, but I am still reluctant to back them to win anywhere at the moment.I feel the same way about Wolves, who have now gone half the season without a victory. Let's call this one a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Andrew's prediction: Wolves surely can't go the whole season without winning a game - a win has got to come from somewhere. With West Ham struggling too, Wolves will probably fancy this a bit, but it's a must-win game for the Hammers too. 0-1AI's prediction: 1-1Vitality Stadium, 17:30I covered Bournemouth's 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday, and the Cherries really impressed me.Andoni Iraola's side have gone 10 games without a win, but they have drawn four of their past five matches and they carried a real threat against the Blues.Their goals came from a couple of long throws but they did look dangerous in open play and, with the way Iraola plays, this is not going to be easy for Arsenal.Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will know that already after Bournemouth did the double over his side last season, but he and his players must be full of confidence after the way they despatched Villa last time out.To beat Villa was a huge result and to produce that performance to go with it was Arsenal really flexing their muscles.It said to everyone 'we are the team to beat' and you have to think they will back it up by beating Bournemouth as well.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Andrew's prediction: Arsenal ended 2025 really well with that win over Villa and the pressure is off them a little bit after City dropped points against Sunderland.I actually think it's more dangerous for them that they have got a bit of breathing space now, rather than thinking they have to win every week, because that is when mistakes could happen - but, the form Bournemouth are in, I can't see them stopping Arsenal. 1-3AI's prediction: 1-3Sunday, 4 JanuaryElland Road, 12:30I am loving Daniel Farke's Leeds United more and more, every passing week. They showed incredible guts to go to Anfield on Thursday and get a point, and they almost took all three.Dominic Calvert-Lewin will start this game after being rested until the last 20 minutes against Liverpool, and he can cause Manchester United all sorts of problems.Seeing Calvert-Lewin start among the substitutes raised a few eyebrows because of the run of scoring he is on, but that is the difficulty managers have at this time of year, when games come thick and fast.I know I go against Manchester United a lot with my predictions, but I am still waiting for them to prove me wrong.They have done all right recently, but nothing more. They have only lost two of their past 13 games, which is decent, but they have drawn five times in that run and, when I watch them, they are just not very exciting.In fact, they are dull. Their fans used to sing 'glory glory Man United' but now they are more likely to sing 'boring boring Man United', when I expected a bit more from them this season.You certainly wouldn't accuse Leeds United of being boring at the moment.Maybe the way they will come at Manchester United will suit the visitors, but Ruben Amorim's side seem to lack leadership when Bruno Fernandes is missing, and I am going to back Leeds United instead.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Andrew's prediction: I am going to go for a bit of an upset here. There is obviously a big rivalry between the two teams so Elland Road will be bouncing, and Leeds have been really good recently. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-2Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00Everton have had a great season so far. Beating Forest was an important result for them, because the six teams immediately above them all dropped points.They are now in eighth place and, with another home league game against Wolves to come after this one, their fans must be thinking this week is a real opportunity to climb higher.It won't be easy against Brentford, however. Keith Andrews' side took seven points out of a possible nine over Christmas, and are also in the top half of the table.I actually think the Bees are a better team when Jordan Henderson isn't playing - Andrews left him out of their wins over Bournemouth and Wolves and they seem to have a bit more energy without him in the team.Whether Henderson plays or not, I just can't see a lot of goals here - one will probably be enough to win it.Brentford are very effective on the counter-attack and are certainly capable of getting a result, but I am going to back Everton to edge it.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Andrew's prediction: This is your 1-1 draw of the week, isn't it? I was talking about these games with my mates and with this one they are eighth and ninth in the table, only a point apart. There will be very little to separate them on the pitch, either. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-1Craven Cottage, 15:00Fulham did really well over Christmas, especially when you consider they have lost key players to the African Cup of Nations.Liverpool must be massively disappointed with their display and result against Leeds, after the upturn in their performances in the past couple of weeks.Like a lot of teams, Arne Slot's side are maybe short of energy at such a busy time of year, and are lacking the spark they need.They lost here last season, and Fulham will fancy a repeat result. I'm not sure about that, but I do think Marco Silva's side will get something from the game.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Andrew's prediction: This should be a great game. Fulham are in good form and they will have a real go at Liverpool. 2-2AI's prediction: 0-2St James' Park, 15:00Crystal Palace are another team I've been wrong about a lot recently - they are on a dismal run, with only one point from their past four games.I should have thought about it more when I was making my predictions because they are badly missing the firepower of Ismaila Sarr, who is away at Afcon with Senegal.Brennan Johnson will add some fresh legs to the Eagles attack, but I actually think Newcastle will run away with this one.I always fancy Newcastle at home to score and also to run over teams, but this season they have sometimes struggled to put games to bed.I am backing them to do all of the above this time, however. Eddie Howe's side smashed Palace 5-0 last season, and this should be another convincing win.Sutton's prediction: 3-0Andrew's prediction: Palace are a tricky team, but with it being at St James' Park I don't see us getting turned over there. We've been decent at home but then we have also thrown away a lot of points from winning positions, so I am hoping we see it out this time.Joelinton being back could make the difference there because he is such a presence in midfield - I said it a few weeks ago when he got injured that I thought we'd lost our nastiness when he wasn't in the team. We need a run of results in 2026 to get up the table so hopefully that starts here. 2-0AI's prediction: 2-0Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00I'm not sure if Sunderland will have anything left in the tank after their efforts against Manchester City on Thursday.It was another example of why they have done so well - they defended brilliantly, but they were dangerous when they got the ball and they could have beaten City too.Mind you, Tottenham are so drab at the moment that it probably won't matter too much if the Black Cats are low on energy.Sunderland are always so well organised at the back, while I don't think Spurs, in an attacking sense, have really clicked this season.Tottenham will be exhausted as well, so I don't see many goals in this one - in fact, I don't see any at all.A goalless draw is unlikely to cheer the Spurs supporters up much, either.I know they love getting angry, but they are a fanbase who don't actually seem to know what they want - is it a manager who delivers attractive attacking football, or someone who can set up a team to keep a clean sheet every week?Sutton's prediction: 0-0Andrew's prediction: I thought there would be a drop-off from Sunderland when they lost so many players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but that hasn't happened - they put in a great performance against City. I don't think they get a win here, but I don't think they lose either - they have got a habit of not getting beaten this season, which is frustrating!Tottenham were really flat against Brentford so they might respond a bit here, but I still see this ending up as another draw. 1-1AI's prediction: 3-1Etihad Stadium, 17:30Chelsea were really not that bad under Enzo Maresca - fifth in the Premier League, into the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and still well placed in the Champions League.His departure was clearly down to a breakdown of his relationship with the club's hierarchy, rather than results.Maresca did not feel he had the control he wanted, and I get why he was unhappy. As Pat Nevin said on BBC Radio 5 Live, maybe Chelsea need a puppet as their next manager, who will do as he is told.I really liked Maresca. I know some Chelsea fans found his style of play last season boring, and a bit predictable, but they ended up in the top four last year and of course they became world champions as well.Their performances in the big games this season have been pretty good, too, but this time, as well as being without Maresca, they are also missing Moises Caicedo - who is suspended after his booking against Bournemouth. He will be a big, big loss.Chelsea have got enough other talent to still go and get a result at Etihad Stadium, but I don't think they will.I am expecting City to find their shooting boots again after they were shut out by Sunderland, especially if they can find a long throw.Chelsea could not deal with Antoine Semenyo's deliveries when they played Bournemouth on Tuesday.A lot has been made of how young Chelsea's defence is, but that's not actually the case.When you look through their team, they are not inexperienced. They will need to do far better against a City side that could be too sharp and streetwise for them, but their age is not an excuse.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Andrew's prediction: City will want to put things right after being held by Sunderland. They might have to be patient here, and I can see it being 1-1 after half an hour... but they will win in the end. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1How did Sutton do last time?There were a few surprise results in week 19, which took in the final games of 2025 on Tuesday, 30 December and the first matches of 2026 on New Year's Day.Chris and his guest, singer-songwriter and Sunderland fan Tom A Smith, both got three correct results with no exact scores for a total of 30 points - although Smith was right about one of the 'shocks' when he backed the Black Cats to hold Manchester City.The BBC readers only managed two correct results but they did get one exact score - Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw with Fulham - giving them 50 points.It was AI who took the weekly win thanks to four correct results and two exact scores, which saw it end up with 100 points.",

    "body": "FTSE 100 hits 10,000 mark for first time11 hours agoPritti Mistry,Business reporterandTheo Leggett,International business correspondentAlamyThe FTSE 100 index has climbed above 10,000 points for the first time, passing a significant stock market milestone, on the first trading day of the year.Shares included in the index performed strongly in 2025, leaving the benchmark more than 21% higher than a year ago, when it stood at just over 8,260. It set a new all-time record reaching 10,046 points before dropping back and closing the day at 9951.Despite much talk of high stock valuations in the US over the past year, the London index outperformed the major American indexes in 2025.Shares in British brands such as Currys and Next rose steeply alongside gains for precious metal miners, defence and financial services companies.The FTSE 100 tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. A big rise is good news for investors, including anyone with a pension or other savings that are invested in the stock market, but is not a direct measure of the UK economy's performance.Many of the constituent companies have large overseas operations as well as a UK presence, and around three quarters of the revenues of the FTSE 100 firms is generated abroad. In 2025 rising gold and silver prices boosted firms such as Rio Tinto, while increased global defence spending lifted contractors including Babcock and Rolls-Royce -  amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The British benchmark index set a new all-time intraday record as trading resumed after the new year holiday, rising more than 1% within the first hour to reach 10,046 points - up 115 from its previous level, before falling back below the threshold. The brief episode of trade above 10,000 followed twelve months of staggered rises.Susannah Streeter, an independent financial commentator, said the 10,000-point marker was \"a psychologically important milestone\" and showed London's blue-chip index was \"back in favour\" with investors.\"Concerns continue to swirl about the super-high valuation of US tech sector,\" she said, making the UK market more appealing.Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said crossing the 10,000-point was a New Year's gift for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who has been calling for more  investment in the UK share market to boost economic growth.\"She has been banging the drum about the merits of investing over parking cash in the bank.\"The FTSE 100's achievements just go to show what's possible when buying UK shares,\" he said.While London-quoted companies were sometimes considered \"old and boring\", the mix of industries, including mining and banking, appealed to investors seeking stability during uncertain times, he said.\"Investors often seek solace in companies whose goods and services should be in demand no matter what's happening in the world. \"For example, we all need to pay insurance or water bills, or those in the habit are still likely to buy cigarettes or vapes, and the FTSE 100 has plenty of companies playing on these themes on offer.\"The chancellor said the FTSE's break-through was \"a vote of confidence in Britain's economy and a strong start to 2026\".The FTSE index, which is dominated by large international companies, closed 2025 at 9,931, after repeatedly hitting record highs during the year. Although it is often seen as a measure of Britain's corporate strength, the FTSE 100 largely reflects global business activity because most of its companies earn a significant share of their revenues overseas rather than from the UK economy.Its rise follows a global trend, which has seen stock markets surge over the expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) will boost company earnings.However, some experts have warned that if high hopes for AI are not realised, or do not appear quickly enough, that enthusiasm could evaporate – and prompt a steep fall in share values.Share prices rise or fall based on investors' expectations of what they think companies will earn in the future. Among the strong performers in 2025 were fashion retailer Next, which raised its profit outlook four times over the year, and luxury brand Burberry which returned to profit after back-to-back annual losses.However, shares in bakery chain Greggs have seen a 39% drop with investors anxious about its expansion plans and lacklustre sales growth. Diageo and WH Smith also suffered sharp falls.",

    "body": "At least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.CBS, the BBC's news partner in America, reported that as of Friday evening local time, two people were killed and several injured.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the southwestern state of Guerrero. A woman, 50, is believed to have died in Guerrero, state governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man. She also said 12 people were injured. Brugada said aftershocks from Friday's earthquake continued to be felt. She urged locals to \"remain calm\" and \"always keep the Life Backpack ready\". She was referring to the emergency backpack Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center encourages residents to prepare to \"help survive the first hours of disaster\". Items should include a flashlight, radio, water, non-perishable foods, warm clothing and a photocopy of all important documents, it says. Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, said Brugada. \"And as a preventive measure, 34 buildings and 5 homes are being inspected.\"After hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.

    "body": "13 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandDanielle Kaye,Business reporterChina's BYD has overtaken Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of  electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival in annual sales.Tesla car sales dropped by nearly 9% in 2025 to 1.64 million vehicles sold worldwide, the carmaker said on Friday - its second consecutive year of falling car deliveries.Those figures placed Tesla behind BYD, which said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.Tesla's car sales fell 16% during the last three months of 2025. The drop was partly due to the repeal of a government subsidy that had helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,570) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles.Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their Tesla sales estimates for 2026, signalling an increasingly gloomy outlook.Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.In October, Tesla responded by launching lower-priced versions of its two best selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn).As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".Analysts say Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving rollout in 2026, which has helped send its share price to a record high, will be crucial to its overall performance.Though there are big questions surrounding Tesla self-driving ambitions, some remain optimistic. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities says Tesla will own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade \"as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope\" of the firm.Besides Tesla, Musk's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.Those commitments, along with running US President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) early last year, led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.Musk has since stepped back from his role in the US government.Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.And despite BYD surpassing Tesla when it comes to car sales, the US firm has remained more profitable in recent quarters. Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.The Shenzhen-based company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

    "body": "Ian Balding, the trainer of the 1971 Epsom Derby winner Mill Reef, has died at the age of 87. Balding, the father of television broadcaster Clare, won the National Hunt Chase on Time at the 1963 Cheltenham Festival during his career as an amateur jockey. It was as a trainer that he excelled though, and his Kingsclere yard in Newbury produced many Group One victors, including Glint Of Gold, Selkirk, Lochsong and most notably Mill Reef. The American-bred colt won the Derby, ridden by Geoff Lewis, as well as the Eclipse Stakes, the King George VI Stakes, the Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe to make Balding champion trainer in 1971.He retired in 2002 and handed over the licence to his son Andrew, who is now a multiple Classic-winning trainer.In a post on Instagram, Park House Stables, external wrote: \"We are deeply sorry to share the sad news that Ian Balding has passed away.\"A wonderful family man, a hugely successful racehorse trainer and a brilliant sportsman.\"He will be greatly missed by all at Park House.\"His daughter Clare, who has presented BBC coverage of seven Olympic Games during her career, wrote on Instagram, external: \"My Dad was one of a kind. Fearless, funny and charming, he was an all-round sportsman, a great trainer and a beautiful horseman. \"He loved his dogs, his horses and his family - probably in that order. \"He shared with me his passion for sport and taught me to be brave enough to chase a dream, even if it seemed impossible. We'll miss him so much.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterA woman has told the BBC she felt \"dehumanised and reduced into a sexual stereotype\" after Elon Musk's AI Grok was used to digitally remove her clothing.The BBC has seen several examples on the social media platform X of people asking the chatbot to undress women to make them appear in bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual situations.XAI, the company behind Grok, did not respond to a request for comment, other than with an automatically-generated reply stating \"legacy media lies\".Samantha Smith shared a post on X about her image being altered, which was met with comments from those who had experienced the same - before others asked Grok to generate more of her.\"Women are not consenting to this,\" she said. \"While it wasn't me that was in states of undress, it looked like me and it felt like me and it felt as violating as if someone had actually posted a nude or a bikini picture of me.\"A Home Office spokesperson said it was legislating to ban nudification tools, and under a new criminal offence, anyone who supplied such tech would \"face a prison sentence and substantial fines\".The regulator Ofcom said tech firms must \"assess the risk\" of people in the UK viewing illegal content on their platforms, but did not confirm whether it was currently investigating X or Grok in relation to AI images.Grok is a free AI assistant - with some paid for premium features - which responds to X users' prompts when they tag it in a post.It is often used to give reaction or more context to other posters' remarks, but people on X are also able to edit an uploaded image through its AI image editing feature.It has been criticised for allowing users to generate photos and videos with nudity and sexualised content, and it was previously accused of making a sexually explicit clip of Taylor Swift.Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University, said X or Grok \"could prevent these forms of abuse if they wanted to\", adding they \"appear to enjoy impunity\".\"The platform has been allowing the creation and distribution of these images for months without taking any action and we have yet to see any challenge by regulators,\" she said.XAI's own acceptable use policy prohibits \"depicting likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner\".In a statement to the BBC, Ofcom said it was illegal to \"create or share non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material\" and confirmed this included sexual deepfakes created with AI.It said platforms such as X were required to take \"appropriate steps\" to \"reduce the risk\" of UK users encountering illegal content on their platforms, and take it down quickly when they become aware of it.Additional reporting by Chris Vallance.",

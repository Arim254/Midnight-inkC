    "body": "Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales, has died aged 63 following a short illness, her office has said.The Conservative peer was appointed to the role twice after becoming a campaigner and activist following the death of her husband Garry who was killed when he confronted a group of youths outside the couple's home.\"Helen was a committed and passionate advocate for victims,\" her office said in a statement, adding that she was a \"dear friend and a respected colleague\" who \"transformed\" the role of commissioner.Tributes were paid in the House of Lords, while Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy praised her \"unparalleled experience and dedication\" to her role.She was most recently appointed to the role in 2023, and was due to serve until the end of this year. She previously served as commissioner from 2012 to 2019.Calling her an \"extraordinary public servant\", Lammy said: \"Her leadership shaped the Victims' Code, strengthened victims' voices in the criminal justice system, and ensured that the Victims and Prisoners Act progressed with victims' interests at its heart.\"She championed the rights of victims and witnesses and held agencies to account.\" Her office said Baroness Newlove \"consistently led by example\", and that she \"reshaped the office into a trusted voice and genuine force for victims\".It added that she was driven by her own experience of the criminal justice system.In August 2007, her 47-year-old husband was killed when he confronted a gang of youths who had vandalised their car, in Warrington, Cheshire.At the time, the court heard that he was kicked \"like a football\" in front of his daughters during the attack. Three teenagers were convicted of his murder in January 2008, and Lady Newlove was made a life peer for her work on youth crime in 2010.\"She was determined that all victims should be treated with compassion, decency and respect - and she consistently led by example,\" her office said.Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Barker said her dedication to defend victims regardless of who was in government at the time, \"a very laudable thing to witness\".Conservative frontbencher Lord Kamall remembered her as a \"fierce campaigner\", while independent crossbencher Baroness O'Loan, hailed her as a \"very lovely person\".The former police ombudsman for Northern Ireland added that she was \"so brave and effective in all that she did\".He added: \"She will be sorely missed, not only by her family, to whom I'm sure we all send great sympathy, but also by so many of us in this House and in the world beyond\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterApple has faced a wave of online mockery following its announcement of a new carrying case for its iPhone range.The US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device.Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear - with one X user calling it \"$230 for a cut up sock\". And the popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said it was a \"litmus test\" for fans who \"buy or defend anything Apple releases\".In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake.The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs.Apple said the product had been inspired by \"a piece of cloth\", and its concept came from \"the idea of creating an additional pocket\".The bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours.The announcement drew criticism on social media, with many suggesting it showed Apple fans would \"pay for anything\".The bag's open top and sock-like structure also caught flak, with one X user saying: \"no zip, no structure and considering how many thefts of iPhones there are these days... no security?\"And some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini.But others came to its defence, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it \"a nod to the history of Apple\". Social media consultant and analyst Matt Navara told the BBC the price tag looked to be less about \"function\" but more about \"form, branding and exclusivity\".\"This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs,\" he said.\"But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty.\"",

    "body": "The Princess of Wales' annual Christmas carol service is to take place for the fifth year early next month, with British movie stars Kate Winslet, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hannah Waddingham delivering readings at the event. The \"power of love and togetherness\" will be celebrated at the Together at Christmas event led by Catherine, who wants to recognise people across the country who contribute to society.Organisers said the theme was picked because people will be able to celebrate love in all forms in a world that can often feel fragmented and disconnected.The service -  which will be a mixture of traditional and modern elements to include people of all faiths and none - will be held in Westminster Abbey on 5 December.Last Christmas, Catherine similarly focused on love, and the importance of giving and receiving empathy, following her cancer diagnosis earlier in the year. She spoke of her relief at completing her course of chemotherapy in September 2024, and revealed this year in January that she is in remission from cancer.In 2021, she surprised guests with her piano-playing skills alongside musician Tom Walker in a clip shown at the event, which was staged for people who supported their communities during the Covid pandemic.Guests at the event will be people who have been nominated by lord-lieutenants across the UK and charities linked to the royal family. Among them will also be guests who have been invited after having shown love and kindness this year.As well as the readings by the British acting stars, carols will be sung by the Westminster Abbey choir, alongside musical performances.A festive display based on the importance of nature in our lives, created by horticulturist Jamie Butterworth, will feature at the event. The Royal Horticultural Society is also set to donate wreaths made by their ambassadors and schoolchildren.Across the UK, 15 community carol services on the same theme of love and togetherness will also take place, including in a community farm in Gwent and an arts centre in Newbury.The Westminster Abbey service will air on ITV1 and ITVX on Christmas Eve and again on Christmas Day.",

    "body": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday. On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country. Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government. According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants. It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created. In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSkims, the shapewear brand co-founded by celebrity and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, says it is now valued at $5bn (£2.93bn) after raising $225m of new funding.The company says it plans to use the money from investors, including an arm of Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, to open more shops and expand around the world.\"We can't wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,\" Kardashian said on Wednesday.The funding round is one of the biggest this year for a US consumer brand and comes as Skims faces fierce competition from rivals like Lululemon.Skims, which runs 18 shops in the US and sells its products through retailers worldwide, will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail business over the next few years, it said in a statement.The company expects its sales to top $1bn this year, which Skims chief executive Jens Grede said gave the firm the confidence to pursue its long-term goals.The brand debuted in 2019 with a line of shapewear and has since broadened its range to include loungewear and other fashion categories.Getty ImagesSkims will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail businessThe company's growth has moved it deeper into the mainstream sports and athleisure market, which is largely dominated by brands like Lululemon and Alo Yoga.Skims has also amassed a large pool of influencers, including the Kardashians and other celebrities like Megan Fox and Paris Hilton to boost its appeal.Since its launch the company has faced some controversies. Its initial name, Kimono Intimates, was criticised for disregarding the significance of the traditional Japanese outfit, prompting the company to come up with another name - Skims.One Skims product - a head wrap worn during sleep - split the internet. Some hailed it as the future of non-invasive face contouring, but others condemned it as dystopian, and said the firm was making women feel more insecure.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNewly released emails suggesting Donald Trump knew about the conduct of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein dominate Thursday's papers. \"He knew about the girls\" is the Guardian's headline, quoting directly from one of the messages released by Democrats on the House oversight committee. The email is one of three published exchanges containing allegations that the US president was aware of Epstein's activities. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Trump \"spent hours\" at Epstein's house with a woman later identified as a victim of sex trafficking is the Financial Times' lead, as it focuses on another allegation revealed in the newly released emails. The paper quotes one senior Democrat saying the latest messages spark \"glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding\" about the nature of Trump and Epstein's relationship.The Daily Mirror echoes with its headline \"Trump 'spent hours with Giuffre'\", naming Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre as one of the women referenced in the new emails. The White House came out in defence of the US president, and accused Democrats of \"selectively leaking emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".Splashed across the Independent is the infamous photo of Trump and his wife Melania with Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell taken at Mar-a-Lago in 2000. The paper also quotes from one of the \"bombshell messages\" in which Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize the dog that hasn't barked is Trump.\"Shifting to news closer to home, the Daily Telegraph's main story covers the ongoing murmurs of a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer. \"Streeting goes to war with No 10\" is the paper's headline after the health secretary was accused of plotting against the prime minister by Sir Keir's top allies. Streeting denied the accusations and branded Downing Street as \"toxic\" and \"juvenile\", the paper reports.\"I am and always have been a faithful\" is how Metro reports the health secretary's response. The paper details Streeting's \"fury\" at the implication that he is leading a \"Traitors-style plot to banish Starmer\" and mocks up a picture of him in the Round Table room of the aforementioned TV show.In another twist to Labour's leadership \"civil war\", the Times says cabinet ministers are demanding the sacking of the PM's chief of staff over allegations he had advance knowledge of the briefings that accused Streeting of a leadership coup. Morgan McSweeney, Sir Keir's most senior aide, has categorically denied criticising the health secretary to the media.\"No 10 in turmoil\" is the i Paper's take, as it describes ministers turning their anger on McSweeney. The paper describes the \"cabinet despair\" over the attacks against the health secretary and Downing Street's \"paranoia over Labour plots\".The Daily Mail features a warning to those potential \"Labour plotters\" from the PM's allies. Those close to Sir Keir say any plans to oust him could trigger a general election, the paper reports. \"At last, a ray of hope!\" declares a sardonic Mail sub-headline.The Daily Express spotlight's the view from the Tories on Labour's infighting. The paper headlines on Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's comments accusing the PM of \"being in office, but not in power\".The Daily Star turns its attention to attention to music and the news that singer Dua Lipa and bands Coldplay and Radiohead are backing a cap on ticket sale prices to give music back to the fans. The paper praises the move as a \"Boldplay\".Finally, the Sun teases a \"Ramsay wedding exclusive\" as it reports that Olympian Adam Peaty was given a police escort at Manchester Airport after receiving threats on his stag do ahead of his wedding to Holly Ramsay. The pair are set to tie the knot at Christmas.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "City's overnight visitors could face £1.30 per night tax10 hours agoJames McCarthyBBC WalesGetty ImagesCardiff wants to introduce a tourism taxCardiff could become the first place in Wales to introduce a tourism tax on paid overnight stays.The fee would be £1.30 per person per night for most types of accommodation and 75p a night for campsites and shared rooms, and is estimated to raise £3.5m a year.The money would go to the Welsh Revenue Authority, which would pay it to local authorities.If the council's cabinet grants approval, a 12-week public consultation will start on 1 December.Legislation was passed in September which allows Welsh councils to charge a small fee to overnight visitors from April 2027.It would apply to paid overnight stays of 31 nights or fewer in hotels, hostels, guesthouses, Airbnbs, campsites and temporary event accommodation.Some visitors would be exempt, including:Children under 18 in campsites or shared roomsPeople staying more than 31 nights in a single bookingThose in emergency or temporary housing arranged by the councilThere was a mixed reaction from some in the business community, with one saying if done correctly it could help boost the city's tourism industry.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: \"The proposed visitor levy in Cardiff would be used to improve the visitor experience for everyone coming to Cardiff, by funding marketing campaigns, or by supporting a broader range of events in the city.\"Not only do we want people to enjoy their experience coming to Cardiff, but we also want people to stay longer, so we need to increase our offer though investment.\"The proposed charge, he said, was lower than that typical in Europe.Federation of Small Businesses Wales chief Joshua Miles said: \"FSB has been and remains of the view that this is not the time to introduce a new tax on tourism in Wales, and that there is a risk of damage done to local economies by its implementation.\"The small business sector has experienced a prolonged period of difficult economic conditions.\"With low consumer spending and disproportionately high costs still affecting some tourism businesses' viability, they still need support to recover.\"He urged Cardiff to explore alternatives that \"do not burden small business and... customers.\"Executive director of business group For Cardiff, Carolyn Brownell, said: \"The introduction of [a] visitor levy by Cardiff Council presents a valuable opportunity to strengthen the city's visitor economy, provided it is implemented in a way that ensures the fund provides additionality and is invested to support Cardiff's tourism sector.\"Nick Saunders, founder and director of events organisers Depot Live, said: \"I don't think it's a terrible idea, the council need to raise money for services.\"At those low levels I don't think it is going to impact on people and a nominal amount like that could really benefit the council.\"There may be some negative response with the ongoing cost of living crisis, he said.\"Even though it is a nominal charge people will have a grumble,\" he said.Related links",

    "body": "A British couple jailed in Iran after being accused of espionage have gone on hunger strike in a \"cry out for help\", their son has told the BBC.Craig and Lindsay Foreman were on an around-the-world motorbike trip when they were arrested by Iranian authorities in January.Joe Bennett, Lindsay's son, described the charges against them as \"ludicrous\". He said his mother had told him \"not eating was the only power she's got\", in the seven-and-a-half minute phone call she was permitted on Tuesday. \"She said she felt lost and let down by the government here as well as the authorities in Iran,\" he added. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) has been approached for comment.The Foremans' family say they entered Iran with valid visas, a licensed guide and a pre-approved itinerary - as rules there stipulate.Lindsay Foreman had been asking people along the route what it means to live a good life.It appears this is what led to their detainment by the Iranian authorities. She has been accused of asking questions that could prompt regime change, Mr Bennett said. The couple have appeared in court several times but have not been officially tried - or convicted. Both are currently in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran.Mr Bennett met UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper last month to discuss the case.The UK government advises against all travel to Iran because of a \"significant risk\" of arrest, and says having a British passport or connections to the UK \"can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you\".The FCDO previously said it \"continued to raise the case of Mr and Ms Foreman directly with the Iranian authorities\" and was providing them with consular assistance. Mr Bennett has only been able to speak to his mother three times since her arrest. The couple, both in their 50s,  were only allowed their first phone calls home in August, after several months of no direct contact.Mr Bennett told the BBC he wasn't sure if the hunger strike had help secure the phone call, or when it had started.\"She was crying and I had to try not to cry on the call because I wanted to stay strong for her and pass the strength on,\" he added.He said his mother was \"usually a very positive person\" and it was the first time he'd heard his mother upset.\"Positivity only lasts so long against reality,\" he said. \"It's just a cry out for help.\"The Foremans were initially held in the city of Kerman and spent 30 days in solitary confinement before being allowed to share a cell. They are now both in separate cells in Iran's Evin jail, where British-Iranian activist Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was imprisoned before her release in 2022. She also went on hunger strike, several times. The Foremans had apparently been promised they would be able to see each other last Sunday but the visit didn't take place.The last time they saw each was during a visit from the British embassy six weeks ago, Mr Bennett said. Another consular visit is due to take place on Sunday.He appealed to the UK to do more to secure their release and specifically state that the couple were not spying for the British government.\"They were having a lovely time visiting Iran,\" he said. \"They couldn't have commended the country more... they were saying it was a beautiful country.\"\"The charges against them are completely bonkers,\" he added.Mr Bennett said the phone call with his mother ended abruptly. He doesn't know when he will hear from her again. Her last words to him were: \"I love you loads and I miss you,\" he said.\"And I said the same to her - 'I love you so so much'. And that's when I started crying, I couldn't hold it together any more.\"Additional reporting by Ruth Comerford.",

    "body": "Type 1 diabetes is worse in the young - here's why1 hour agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentNye familyGracie Nye in hospital when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetesScientists have discovered why type 1 diabetes is more severe and aggressive when it develops in young children.Type 1 is caused by the immune system attacking cells in the pancreas that control blood sugar levels.The research team showed the pancreas was still developing in childhood, particularly under the age of seven, making it far more vulnerable to damage.They say newly developed drugs could buy patients time for the pancreas to mature, delaying the disease.Type 1 diabetes affects around 400,000 people in the UK.Gracie, age eight from Merseyside, became suddenly ill on Halloween in 2018. It started as a slight cold, but rapidly escalated.\"She went from being a very happy one-year-old, who would go to nursery and dance and sing, to almost dying in less than 48 hours,\" says dad Gareth.\"The diagnosis remains the worst part of our life.Suddenly everything we took for granted was 10-20 times harder,\" he says.Nye familyNye family, with Gracie wearing pink glassesThe Nye family had to adapt quickly - keeping on top of everything Gracie had to eat or drink, checking blood sugar levels and giving the hormone insulin to tell her body to absorb the sugar in her blood.Gracie now has a glucose monitor and an insulin pump and is \"bossing diabetes\", says her dad.\"Gracie's a superstar,\" he adds.But why children diagnosed young like Gracie, especially those under the age of seven, have a more aggressive disease than those diagnosed in their teenage years or later, has remained a mystery.   The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows it is down to the development of the beta cells living in the pancreas.These are the cells that release the hormone insulin when sugar levels rise in the blood after we eat. Researchers at the University of Exeter studied pancreas samples from 250 donors, allowing them to see how the beta cells formed normally as people got older, and in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes UKEarlier in life these beta cells were shown to exist as small clusters or as individual cells, but as we age they grow in number and mature into larger groups known as Islets of Langerhans.The study was able to see what happened after the immune system turned against a patient's own beta cells.Beta cells in small clusters were picked off and destroyed so they never had the chance to mature. Those in larger islets were still attacked, but were more durable allowing patients to still produce low levels of insulin which reduced the severity of their disease.\"I think this is a really significant finding for type 1 diabetes - this research really sheds light on why the disease is more aggressive in children,\" Dr Sarah Richardson, from the University of Exeter, told the BBC.She said \"the future is much brighter\" for children being diagnosed with type 1 now. This includes the possibility of screening healthy children for the disease and of new immunotherapy drugs to delay it.The UK has licensed teplizumab - an immunotherapy that can stop the immune system attacking beta cells and may be able to give them time to mature - although it is not available on the NHS. \"Because we have new drugs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in children, we hope that these will be able to prevent or delay the onset in those young people,\" said Dr Richardson.Missing piece of the puzzleThe research was part of the Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge organised by the Steve Morgan Foundation, Diabetes UK, and Breakthrough T1D. Rachel Connor, director of research partnerships at Breakthrough T1D, said: \"This study gives us a missing piece of the puzzle, explaining why type 1 diabetes progresses so much faster in children than in adults.\"Dr Elizabeth Robertson, director of research and clinical at Diabetes UK, said: \"Uncovering why type 1 diabetes is so aggressive in young children opens the door to developing new immunotherapies aimed at slowing or stopping the immune attack, potentially giving children more precious years without insulin therapy and, one day, preventing the need for it entirely.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Eastern and Southern Europe correspondent and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later, he said. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told, according to Ansa news agency. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling him: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"Italian prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.However, members of the British forces who served in Sarajevo in the 1990s have told the BBC that they never heard of any so-called \"sniper tourism\" during  the Bosnian conflict.They indicated that any attempts to bring in people from third countries who had paid to shoot at civilians in Sarajevo would have been \"logistically difficult to accomplish\", due to the proliferation of checkpoints.British forces served both inside Sarajevo and in the areas surrounding the city, where Serb forces were stationed and they saw nothing at the time to suggest that \"sniper tourism\" was taking place.One soldier described the allegations that foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians as an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "Dua Lipa and Coldplay urge action on ticket touts1 hour agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesDua Lipa was among the artists calling on the government to curb the resale of tickets at vastly inflated pricesPop stars including Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Sam Fender, Radiohead and The Cure have called on Sir Keir Starmer to honour his election promise to protect fans from online ticket touts.More than 40 musicians have signed a letter urging the UK prime minister to \"stop touts from fleecing fans\" and cap the price that can be charged when tickets are resold.The government launched a public consultation on the issue in January after complaints from fans, saying it would tackle touts who \"are systematically buying up tickets on the primary market and reselling them to fans at often hugely inflated prices\".But seven months after the consultation closed, there has been no indication of when legislation might be introduced.'Ripped off'New research from Which? magazine found that some tickets to see Oasis at Wembley Stadium this summer were listed for as much as £4,442.According to analysis by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), tickets sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.In January, the government said it was considering a price cap of up to 30%.Dan Smith from indie-pop group Bastille said \"it seems crazy\" that fans aren't protected from price hikes, when countries like Ireland and Australia have introduced caps on ticket resales.\"It's not surprising that the idea of a price cap has such widespread support from bands and artists,\" he said. \"With the support of the government we can all move to a situation where people no longer get ripped off by touts and genuine fans can easily resell unwanted tickets for their original price.\"A spokesperson for the Department for Culture said: \"This government is fully committed to clamping down on touts and is going further to put fans back at the heart of live events.\"We have carefully considered evidence provided in response to our consultation earlier this year and will set out our plans shortly.\"The government's consultation also proposed limiting the number of tickets that resellers can offer.In the letter, artists including PJ Harvey, Mark Knopfler, Amy MacDonald, Iron Maiden and Nick Cave joined consumer organisations in urging the government to respond to the consultation \"as soon as possible, and commit to include legislation on a price cap in the next King's Speech\".They said the move would \"restore faith in the ticketing system\" and \"help democratise public access to the arts\".Getty ImagesColdplay played a record-breaking 10 nights at Wembley Stadium this summer - but many fans paid over the odds to see the showThe letter comes as Which? found prolific sellers in Brazil, Dubai, Singapore, Spain and the US hoovering up tickets for popular US events before relisting them at inflated prices on sites like StubHub and Viagogo.The findings echoed a BBC investigation this summer, which discovered teams of overseas workers bulk-buying tickets for concerts in the UK to resell for profit.The watchdog found it was often difficult for fans to establish the seller's identity or to contact them - despite the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) securing a court order in 2018 requiring Viagogo to reveal the identity of traders.Which? also found evidence of speculative selling - when tickets are listed on secondary sites even though the seller has not bought them yet.Which? consumer law expert Lisa Webb said the joint statement issued on Thursday \"makes clear that artists, fan organisations and consumers reject the broken ticketing market that has allowed touts to thrive for too long\".Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub claim a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media - putting them at increased risk of fraud.In football's Premier League, where resales are forbidden because the sport must abide by stricter laws than music events in order to maintain segregation in stadiums, the BBC recently uncovered a black market for match tickets, with some exchanging hands for tens of thousands of pounds.",

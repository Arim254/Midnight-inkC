    "body": "16 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentBBCAs ambulances queued in front of Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading last week, corridors full of patients were waiting for a bed on a ward. Emergency department consultant Omar Nafousi was at his wit's end.\"We've no space,\" he told the BBC last week. \"This is not what I signed up for when I became a doctor.\"It is a scene that is being repeated in hospitals up and down the country as winter viruses and cold weather add to the pressures on the health service. Currently nearly 4,000 beds in England alone are taken up by patients with flu, Covid and the vomiting bug norovirus, according to NHS England, and the situation is on a similar scale in the rest of the UK.But that is dwarfed by another pressure – the patients who should not be in hospital.In Pictures via Getty ImagesOmar Nafousi, an emergency department consultant told the BBC last week, 'We've no space... This is not what I signed up for when I became a doctor'Every day there are more than 13,000 people whose treatment has been completed who are still in hospitals in England, the latest figures from NHS England suggest. Plus there are a further 4,000 around the rest of the UK - which means around one in eight beds are occupied by people who don't necessarily need to be there.Many of these \"delayed discharge\" patients are older and may be frail and living with multiple health conditions who need support in the community.But it comes at a huge cost. The average hospital bed takes £562 a day to staff and maintain, according to NHS England, meaning the health service in England is losing more than £225m a month supporting patients who could be elsewhere.Then there is the cost to other patients. \"We are seeing surgery cancelled and long waits in A&E because there are no beds available on the wards,\" says Clifford Kilgore, a senior nurse working with older people, who serves on the Nurses and Allied Health Professionals' Council of the British Geriatrics Society.As for the staff there is a toll on morale, too - among doctors, nurses and ambulance workers. \"It's terrible when you see patients go downhill in hospital when you know they would be better off somewhere else,\" says Laura Hichens, a nurse who leads the \"discharge liaison\" team at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead.The issue of delayed discharges is far from new. For years, it has been talked about, if not agonised over, and the NHS started tracking the delays in the early 2010s. Last summer, the government launched an urgent and emergency care plan, which pledged to reduce the delays, with the promise there would be improvements.If it could be solved, the impact on the NHS would be transformative, experts have told me. Yet the problem throws up many deeper questions about the care system, coordination and planning in hospitals - with some doctors even asking whether the NHS is over-treating patients, particularly those at the end of life.'The system's running faster just to stand still'On paper, it all sounds straightforward: simply send all those patients who are well home. But it's not that easy.\"It takes a lot of time and effort to discharge a patient,\" says Emma Dodsworth, a researcher who has studied the issue for Nuffield Trust think tank. \"Some may need adaptations to their home, some short-term help with washing and dressing or home visits from nurses. Some a combination of all three, while others may need a care home place to be found.\"And because the population is getting older and frailer, there are more complex cases ending up in hospital. The system is having to run faster just to stand still.\"Arranging the discharge of these patients relies on a close relationship between council-run social care services and the NHS.Getty ImagesAt Queen Elizabeth Hospital, social workers arrange help such as washing or dressing in people's own home, and physiotherapists and occupational therapists can help older people stay mobile and live independentlyThere are plenty of examples of this happening. At Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital social workers and nurses are working side-by-side in the discharge liaison hub, which has been fully up and running for two years. The hub also has a housing officer, employed by the council, to arrange home adaptations or temporary housing.Planning for discharge begins as soon as a patient is admitted to hospital. \"That means when they are ready to be discharged it can be done pretty much straight away for many,\" says Hichens.Figures show the hub consistently discharges patients more quickly than average.It's a template that some might suggest should be rolled out en masse across the country - but so far that hasn't happened.'Strained relations' with social careA recent report by the NHS Confederation and Association of Directors of Social Services (ADASS) warns that cooperation between the NHS and social care sectors is \"inconsistent\" across the country with relationships sometimes becoming \"frictional\".Kerrie Allward, who acts as a policy lead for ADASS and is executive director for adult social care and health at Walsall Council, is not surprised by these findings.Her area has adopted a similar approach to Gateshead and she says that led to a five-fold drop in delayed discharges in the year after it was introduced.But she argues that across the social care sector money remains a \"critical issue\" – with local government funding squeezed so much over the past decade or so that spending on social care has not been able to keep up.Local authorities are spending around £32bn a year on adult social care – that is £4.6bn higher in real terms than 2010-11 – but councils argue that increase has been swallowed up by higher costs, increasing demand and greater complexity of need.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesLocal authorities are spending around £32bn a year on adult social careAllward says some councils have tried to compensate by spending ever more on social care - which now accounts for more than half of their budgets across the board. But, she says, \"Councils often lack the funds to invest in integrated services that would support more timely discharge.\"And while she enjoys working with the NHS, in her experience not all social care directors feel the same - she says that some NHS leaders blame social care for delayed discharges.\"This blame can strain relationships, especially as data reveals that social care is usually responsible for only a minority of delays.\"The government said it was increasing investment further in the coming years, while seeking wider reform of the way services are funded.Examining the Danish approach Some other European countries have a different approach.Denmark, for example, has created a national network of \"intermediate care beds\" in community hospitals and care homes, staffed by nurses and carers, that patients can be discharged into.Denmark has also invested in community nursing services to support patients in the community and in their homes rather than in hospital. \"We could learn from places like Denmark where there is much greater integration between health and social care,\" says Dodsworth.Getty ImagesAllward says some other European countries, such as Denmark, have a much more coordinated approach to health and social careSome NHS trusts have bought places in care homes to allow them to discharge patients. University Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust has taken this one step further: it has spent £10m buying and renovating a former care home in the city called Preston Lodge, which opened in July and has more than 50 beds.Staffed by nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and with its own GP, it allows patients who are medically fit to leave hospital continue to receive support. Preston Lodge says these patients would have spent an extra 10 days in hospital on average.Inside Preston Lodge, patients eat meals together and some of them socialise, too - doing jigsaw puzzles and watching TV together.\"Hospitals are great places when you are acutely ill, but they are not when you no longer need that medical care,\" says the trust's head of nursing Emma Roberts. Dodsworth says these \"step-down\" facilities can help patients get back on to their feet while not taking up a hospital bed.However, she says the lack of integration between social care and the NHS remains an obstacle to this approach being used more widely.The question of family responsibilityImproving coordination between the NHS and councils is only part of the solution, however. NHS England monthly data shows that around only a third of delays are down to lack of community care or a care home place.Another challenge is the attitude of some families who prefer - and feel safer, perhaps - if their loved one is under the care of a hospital.Hichens says she spends much of her time persuading the family members of patients that they would be happier elsewhere - and healthier too.\"They think hospital is the best place for their relative,\" she says. \"But we know the longer you spend in hospital the more patients are at risk of getting frailer, losing strength and needing more care.\"\"Hospitals are great places when you are acutely ill, but they are not when you no longer need that medical care,\" says Emma Roberts, a head of nursing at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS TrustSome families are not prepared to take on caring responsibilities either, says Dr Vicky Price, an acute medical consultant who diagnoses and treats patients brought in as emergency admissions.\"In some countries, the culture is different – they don't need care homes because families step in.\"But she concedes it can be difficult for some families, including financial pressures that make caring for a relative a challenge. \"There are justifiable reasons why they can't take on that responsibility.\"Time to rethink end-of-life care?In Price's view, her own profession bears some responsibility, too. She says about a third of people who are admitted for medical reasons are in their last year of life.\"We admit them and end up over-treating them with interventions, scans and pills,\" argues Price, who is president of the Society for Acute Medicine.One patient she saw recently was in his late 80s and had 14 appointments booked for the next two months for health problems including cardiac and renal issues, and liver and eye problems.\"I talked to him – the only one he really wanted to keep was the eye one,\" she says. \"We cancelled the rest.\"The problem when you start trying to treat everything is that you prescribe more pills, those pills have side-effects and you can actually end up making a person's health worse.\" Heritage Images via Getty ImagesThis ward at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, pictured in the early Twentieth Century, had rugs, pictured on the walls and other home comfortsDoctors often lack the confidence as well as the time to have these difficult discussions with families, Price says.But changing that approach would also raise numerous ethical questions.She says for many of these patients, palliative care and managing their symptoms, mainly pain, would be preferable: \"Their quality of life would be much better and we would avoid a hospital admission.\"But in practice there are obstacles to this.And the Association of Palliative Medicine has long argued there is insufficient investment in end-of-life care, which means people struggle to get support. Marie Curie suggest nearly a quarter of people who need palliative care do not get it.More from InDepthClifford Kilgore agrees reducing admissions is a key part of the solution. \"Hospitals are good for treating an acute illness, but the problem is that if you admit an older person with pneumonia they can spend a week in a hospital bed not moving and they become immobile and unable to look after themselves,\" he says.\"It is a vicious cycle. For some patients, being in hospital actually causes harm.\"He helps to run a \"hospital-at-home\" service, which provides specialist hospital-level care to patients with frailty and conditions such as heart failure and respiratory illness.Services of this kind care for around 12,000 people around the country, but again they are not available everywhere. Providing more expert care like this outside of hospital is a priority for the NHS under the government's 10-year plan.Kilgore says it cannot come soon enough: \"Get this right and it would have an immediate impact.\" But not soon enough for those patients in Reading queuing for a bed.Top picture credit: LightRocket via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Are fans being turned off multi-club ownership model?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Strasbourg's ultras have stayed silent for the first 15 minutes of games and held up banners in protest at the club being involved with BlueCoByFootball issues correspondentMost Strasbourg fans thought they had it good from the deal which tied them together with Chelsea.After all, the BlueCo investment has given the French side a team who are competitive in Ligue 1 and finished top of the Uefa Conference League table last month.There has been a £157m revamp of their Stade de la Meinau home, improving facilities and increasing capacity.Then there is their activity in the transfer market.Before Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital-owned BlueCo took control in 2023 the club's total transfer fees paid out per season were £6.1m, £3.9m and £9.5m.In the following three seasons Strasbourg have spent £52.6m, £53.6m and £96.5m. They were the biggest-spending club in France last summer, outgunning even Paris St-Germain (£89.2m).Success on the pitch was underpinned by the attacking and exciting football under Liam Rosenior. Until now.Last week the Englishman left to take charge of Chelsea. Those who were happy to accept success over a loss of autonomy in a multi-club ownership (MCO) structure now know the trade-off.There is evidence that opinion appears to be changing as fans find out what it means to be the perceived subservient partner.Strasbourg-based L'Equipe journalist Cyril Olives-Berthet says BlueCo have \"shot themselves in the foot\".\"The general opinion is utter shock,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Even people who thought there was some interesting stuff with BlueCo are shocked.\"BlueCo had a relatively good image around France after last season. That is Rosenior, the players and the style of play.\"The backlash is harsh, in the media and with football fans.\"Gary O'Neil has arrived as Rosenior's successor but Olives-Berthet says there is much scepticism. Supporters feel the 42-year-old lacks the experience for the job, having amassed 100 games during managerial spells at Bournemouth and Wolves.'A symbol of everything that is wrong with modern football'Some Strasbourg supporters have never accepted BlueCo. The club's ultras stay silent for the first 15 minutes of every match in protest.It reflects the opinion of a not-so-vocal minority. L'Equipe has reported, external how other supporters, attracted by the new signings and the team's style of play, have booed the ultras.But for the ultras, Rosenior's move to Stamford Bridge reinforces their stance.\"The fact Rosenior is jumping on the Chelsea bandwagon is a symbol of everything that is wrong with modern football, and especially with multi-club ownership,\" Alexandre, spokesperson for the Strasbourg supporters' federation, told BBC Sport.\"It is different to legitimate ambition, and we know someone is going to, at some point, leave for a bigger club. No problem with that.\"But leaving your team in the middle of a season, that's not OK. That's not a thing you would do.\"Alexandre has long been a strong critic and described Strasbourg as a \"Chelsea B team\".It stings for club president Marc Keller, too. He took the club from financial ruin in the fifth tier of French football in 2012 and back to the top flight before selling to BlueCo.Keller recently rejected suggestions Strasbourg had become Chelsea's \"feeder club\" in an interview with BBC Sport. That came after it was announced star striker and captain Emmanuel Emegha would join Chelsea at the end of this season.Rosenior taking the same path appears to weaken his argument.Keller said he wanted to keep him but denied reports he had threatened to quit himself if Rosenior went to Chelsea.\"Liam's departure wasn't planned,\" said Keller, a former midfielder at Strasbourg as well as West Ham, Portsmouth and Blackburn.\"I can understand the surprise, even the disappointment, of some of our supporters.\"And do you think I'm happy about it? The situation was neither planned nor desired by anyone at the club. Sometimes, you have to adapt in football.\"Keller said Rosenior rejected an offer from another Champions League club, believed to be Bayer Leverkusen, earlier this season but now wanted to be \"closer to his family\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Strasbourg will lose Emmanuel Emegha to Chelsea in the summerChelsea and Strasbourg a 'unique' collaborationHalf of the Premier League is now in some form of multi-club ownership (MCO). But those clubs are at the top of the food chain and would not have experience of being the poorer relative.The City Football Group has Manchester City as its core club, and full control of teams in Italy, France, Brazil, Australia, Uruguay and Belgium. It also owns 47% of Girona in Spain.Red Bull is a majority owner of teams in Germany, Austria, the United States and Brazil, with minority stakes in other clubs, including Leeds United.These are major football operations, MCO behemoths. Players and managers will move between entities. It is like an employee getting promoted through a multi-national company.Head coach Jesse Marsch, for instance, went from New York Red Bulls to Salzburg to Leipzig. But never in the middle of a season.Other MCOs are set up share ideas and enjoy relative growth, such as Tony Bloom's interest in Brighton, Union Saint-Gilloise, Hearts and Melbourne Victory.Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos owns 100% of Nice and Swiss club FC Lausanne-Sport, but only 28.94% of Manchester United. But his decisive influence in football operations at Old Trafford is enough to trigger one of Uefa's indicators of an MCO.Chelsea and Strasbourg's two-club MCO is \"unique\", football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport. While most MCOs tend to be football focused, he added BlueCo is more of a hedge-fund strategy. That means bringing in assets that are low value and selling them on high returns. \"Strasbourg are perhaps slightly adrift in the sense they are seen as a holding area of talent that perhaps Chelsea want to bring to the club at a later point,\" said Maguire. \"You could argue that's the case with Rosenior, to get experience at another part of the Chelsea empire.\"BlueCo target younger players, they put them on long-term contracts. The players deliver and the value of the player is locked in.\"Strasbourg have the youngest squad in Europe's top five leagues, with Chelsea the fourth-youngest.How both clubs are linked in the transfer marketStrasbourg now have a football team that appear to be going places, and that could not have happened without BlueCo.It has worked the other way, too, in transfer spending.Strasbourg twice broke their record fee received in 2025. First Sunderland paid £27.3m to sign academy product Habib Diarra. Then Nottingham Forest spent £30.3m on Dilane Bakwa, giving Strasbourg a £27.1m profit on a player who came from Bordeaux as one of the first BlueCo signings.BlueCo would argue that without its involvement, these players - who are evidence of its strategic model - would be sold sooner, and for less.Transfers by market forces are part of the game, as Alexandre alluded to, but the inter-MCO transfers have raised eyebrows.Eleven players have moved between Chelsea and Strasbourg, with the Ligue 1 club largely benefiting from loans and the arrival of England left-back Ben Chilwell in September.There are strange cases, though, like Ishe Samuels-Smith, who moved to Chelsea from Everton's academy in 2023 and has never played a first-team game. In July, the 19-year-old full-back joined Strasbourg, only to return to Chelsea on transfer deadline day in September and immediately be loaned to Swansea City.Defender Mamadou Sarr was sold to Chelsea in the summer, but made only one appearance as a substitute at the Fifa Club World Cup and is now back at Strasbourg on loan for this season.Emegha will become the 12th player in July. With 14 Ligue 1 goals last season and  seven in 11 in all competitions this campaign, the Dutch forward's departure is more significant.Another of BlueCo's initial signings, he had only been made club captain weeks before the announcement. The ultras unfurled banners calling for the player to hand back the armband.Could this mark a shift in opinion?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, \"Crystal Palace downgrades. Even when you win, you lose. No to multiple ownership\" - Strasbourg fans display a message of support to Crystal Palace after their demotion to the Conference League due to being in an MCOStrasbourg are finding out that things are not always rosy down the food chain.They are not the only fans to show their displeasure, either.For instance, in May 2024 supporters of fellow French club Troyes, part of the City Football Group, protested by throwing flares on to the pitch and getting a match against Valenciennes abandoned. Troyes had been facing back-to-back relegations to the third tier and were saved only by the bankruptcy of Bordeaux. They are now clear at the top of Ligue 2.Fans can protest but there appears little football's authorities can do to roll back on MCOs despite genuine concerns over the integrity of competitions.Technically Fifa could restrict international transfers between the clubs, but that is not on the table. Fifa does have jurisdiction within its own competitions. It removed Mexico's Club Leon from last summer's Club World Cup due to their association with Pachuca.Uefa is getting tougher but has the same restrictions. Crystal Palace, Drogheda United and FC DAC 1904 became the first clubs ever to face demotion or removal from a competition this season for being in a multi-club structure.It just so happened Strasbourg played Palace in the Europa Conference League. The French club's ultras held up banners in solidarity with the Eagles when the two clubs met  in November. Last season Chelsea and Strasbourg could have been in the same European competition, but BlueCo took steps to be compliant with Uefa's rules so both would be admitted. In the end that move was not tested, but it may be needed another time.Uefa is expected to go further but whether it has the power to do anything which would halt MCOs is debatable.That ship may have already sailed.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaulin KolaEPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, say they are co-operating with the investigationA judge in Switzerland has ordered that one of the two co-owners of the ski resort bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve be kept in detention for 90 days.Swiss prosecutors have argued that Jacques Moretti, a French national, is a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana also left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20.The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations.Authorities acknowledged last week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.Watch: Co-owner of Swiss ski bar apologises to victimsJacques Moretti was first detained on Friday for an initial period of 48 hours. On Monday, a judge at what is known as a court of coercive measures ruled that he should be kept in custody for three months - a period that can be renewed under Swiss law.It is known as provisional - or preventive - detention and is meant to last until a case goes to court. In this instance, the court said the measure may be lifted upon payment of bail, whose sum would be set later.The couple were placed under criminal investigation days after the devastating fire. Moretti's wife, Jessica, who is under house arrest, told reporters on Friday that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.EPA/ShutterstockPeople across Switzerland observed a minute's silence on FridayThe news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoJoe Tidy,Cyber correspondentandLiv McMahon,Technology reporterInstagram has denied it has been victim to a data breach after many users received emails prompting them to reset their password.The firm said it had resolved a problem which allowed \"an external party\" to get the social media platform to send out legitimate password reset requests to users.Instagram said there had been no breach of its systems, and told users their accounts were secure.But some experts have questioned the statement, with cyber security firm Malwarebytes claiming the password reset emails had in fact been sent as a result of a hack.\"Cybercriminals stole the sensitive information of 17.5 million Instagram accounts, including usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and more,\" it claimed in a post on X, along with a screenshot of a password reset email from Instagram.No further details were given by the company, but the post has been viewed more than 2.3 million times.Malwarebytes told the BBC it believed the password reset emails were a direct result of an ongoing sale of private data on a hacker forum, where a criminal has claimed to have the personal details of 17.5 million Instagram users.The advert claims the data comes from a \"leak\" in 2024. But some security researchers think it is actually an old database that was gathered from data which could be publicly viewed - such as names and locations - in 2022.The password reset emails coupled with the Malwarebytes warning has prompted confusion for thousands of people on social media.And Instagram's explanation also posed questions.\"We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,\" the company said. \"There was no breach of our systems.\"But Instagram did not respond to the BBC's questions about who the external party was which could send out legitimate password reset requests on behalf of the firm.The emails caused concern for some users on social media, who feared it was a scam or phishing attempt designed to glean more of their details.But the links in the email do not appear to be malicious, and the password reset process a user is guided through appeared to be legitimate.However the advice, as ever, is to go straight to the website or app to make changes to passwords and add extra protection.",

    "body": "A man who used a smashed bottle to try and kill a stranger on a train has been jailed for 12 years.Thomas Craig, 48, was caught on CCTV repeatedly stabbing Glenn Lennon on the Glasgow Queen Street to Perth service on 16 February 2024, while high on alcohol and cocaine.The 23-year-old victim was struck near the heart, with his injuries including a collapsed lung and a severed artery. He also lost 40% of his blood.At the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Arthurson told Craig he had committed a \"violently appalling attack\" on Lennon and another man, Aaron Nelson, terrifying them and all the witnesses on the train.Lennon was set upon after Craig, of Barrhead, Renfrewshire, initially turned on Nelson following a minor disagreement.Footage released by British Transport Police showed Craig leaping from his seat armed with the glass bottle.He was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated assault following a trial last month.The court heard how Craig had been drinking alcohol for six hours and had also taken cocaine that day. Lord Arthurson told Craig: \"Your victims were complete strangers to you. In a background report for this case, you described yourself as 'a monster' who was unrecognisable to you.\"You launched a violently appalling attack, terrifying them and all on board who witnessed what you did.\"The judge also paid tribute to other passengers who went to help the injured victims, including a nurse who was on board.Jurors had heard how Craig hurled an insult at Nelson, 22, before suddenly leaving his seat and hitting him over the head with the bottle.Nelson tried to escape down the carriage as other panicked travellers watched, but the attacker caught up and struck him again, causing the weapon to smash.Mr Lennon attempted to step in but was then struck in the chest with the broken neck of the bottle.Both victims have been left scarred for life.Craig was seen on camera walking back down the train and changing out of his blood-splattered jumper into a clean hoodie.Police and paramedics met the train at Larbert railway station where the victims were taken to hospital and Craig was arrested.Tony Graham KC, defending, said \"There are essentially two Thomas Craigs.\"One who behaves in an inappropriate and criminal way and one who is a contributor to those around him.\"The advocate added Craig \"struggled to understand\" how he behaved that day, but is aware the attacks will likely continue to \"haunt\" the victims.Craig had also written a letter for Lord Arthurson which the judge described as \"impressive\".He will also be supervised for a further three years on his release.",

    "body": "6 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondentGetty ImagesThere may be up to 200 million one-person households in China by 2030, according to a reportA new bleak-sounding app has taken China by storm.Named Are You Dead? the concept is simple. You need to check in with it every two days – clicking a large button – to confirm that you are alive. If not, it will get in touch with your appointed emergency contact and inform them that you may be in trouble.It was launched in May last year to not much fanfare but attention around it has exploded in recent weeks with many young people, who live alone in Chinese cities, downloading it in droves. This has propelled it to become the most downloaded paid app in the country.According to research institutions, there may be up to 200 million one-person households in China by 2030, Chinese state media outlet Global Times reports. And it's those people that the app - which describes itself as a \"safety company companion... whether you're a solo office worker, a student living away from home, or anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle\" - is trying to target. \"People who live alone at any stage of their life need something like this, as do introverts, those with depression, the unemployed and others in vulnerable situations,\" said one user on Chinese social media.\"There is a fear that people living alone might die unnoticed, with no one to call for help. I sometimes wonder, if I died alone, who would collect my body?\" said another.Screenshot/Moonshot TechnologiesThe app requires you to click a large button daily to confirm that you are aliveWilson Hou, 38,  who lives around 100km (62 miles) from his family, says that is exactly why he downloaded the app. He works in the capital Beijing. He returns home to his wife and child twice a week, but says he has to be away from them at the moment to work on a project and he mostly sleeps on site.\"I worry that if something happened to me, I could die alone in the place I rent and no-one would know,\" he said. \"That's why I downloaded the app and I set my mum as my emergency contact.\"He also added that he downloaded the app quickly after its release, fearing it would be banned because of the negative connotations around it.Some have been quick to bash the app's less than cheery name - saying that signing up for it might bring ill fortune. Others have called for it to be changed to something with a more positive spin, like \"Are you ok?\" or \"How are you?\".And though the success of this app must be, in part, because of its catchy-sounding name, the company behind the app, Moonscape Technologies, has said it is taking on board the criticism of the current title and weighing up a potential name change.Screenshot/Moonshot TechnologiesThe app sends alerts like these to an appointed emergency contact The app, which is listed internationally under the name Demumu, ranks in the top two in the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, and top four in Australia and Spain for paid utility apps - possibly driven by Chinese users living overseas.The current name is a word play on a successful food delivery app called \"Are you Hungry?\". In Chinese, \"Si-le-ma\" sounds like the name of the food app \"E-le-ma\". First launched as a free app, the app has now made its way into the paid category - albeit at the low price of 8 yuan ($1.15; £0.85). Little is known about the founders of Are You Dead?, but they say they are three people who were born after 1995 who built the app from Zhengzhou in Henan with a small team.It has certainly grown in value now. One of these men, who goes by the name Mr Guo, told Chinese media that they intended to raise money by selling 10% of the company for a million yuan. That is a lot more than the 1,000 yuan ($140) they say it cost to build the app.And they're also looking to grow their target audience - saying they are exploring the idea of a new product specifically designed for the elderly in a country where over one-fifth of its population is over the age of 60. In an indication that it was seriously looking at this option, it posted over the weekend, \"we would like to call on more people to pay attention to the elderly who are living at home, to give them more care and understanding. They have dreams, strive to live, and deserve to be seen, respected and protected.\"The company has not responded to questions from the BBC.",

    "body": "4 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC News PersianandJessica RawnsleyA referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran.Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian.\"Everyone knew him for his kindness\", they said, adding his family is grieving and \"angry because he was killed by the regime\".Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. \"She fought for things she knew were right\", her uncle told CNN.Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported.Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA).The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA.Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night.The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene.\"It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,\" the friend said.The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: \"From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.\"They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as \"someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery\".\"Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him,\" his friend said. \"The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime.\"Also killed was Aminian, a Kurdish student who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups.Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces.The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death.The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said.\"She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for,\" her uncle told CNN. \"She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard.\"He added that she was \"thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights\". \"Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived.\"Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO.The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said.\"It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes,\" Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source.Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said.The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran.Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers,\" while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering \"very strong options\".Iran has also accused protesters of being backed by the US and Israel.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura Cress,Technology reporterandLiv MacMahon,Technology reporterSOPA Images via GettyOfcom has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok is being used to create sexualised images.In a statement, the UK watchdog said there had been \"deeply concerning reports\" of the chatbot being used to create and share undressed images of people, as well as \"sexualised images of children\".If found to have broken the law, Ofcom can potentially issue X with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18 million, whichever is greater.X referred the BBC to a statement posted by its Safety account at the start of January: \"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\". Elon Musk later said the UK government wanted \"any excuse for censorship\" in response to a post questioning why other AI platforms were not being looked at.The BBC has seen several examples of digitally altered images on X, in which women were undressed and put in sexual positions without their consent. One woman said more than 100 sexualised images have been created of her.If X does not comply, Ofcom can seek a court order to force internet service providers to block access to the site in the UK altogether.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC she welcomed the body's investigation and urged it to complete it as soon as possible.\"It is vital that Ofcom complete this investigation swiftly because the public - and most importantly the victims - will not accept any delay,\" she said.Kendall's predecessor Peter Kyle told BBC Breakfast it was \"appalling\" that Grok had \"not been tested appropriately\".\"The fact that I met just yesterday a Jewish woman who has found her image of herself in a bikini outside of Auschwitz being generated by AI and put online made me feel sick to my stomach,\" he said.Watch: Backlash against Elon Musk's Grok AI explainedOther MPs who have raised concerns include Northern Ireland politician Cara Hunter, who said she had decided to leave the platform.Downing Street meanwhile said the government remains focused on \"protecting children\" but would keep its presence on X \"under review\". \"I think we've been clear that all options are on the table,\" the Prime Minister's official spokesperson said.Dr Daisy Dixon, who previously told the BBC she felt \"humiliated\" following multiple instances of people using Grok to undress her, said she welcomed an investigation.\"For Musk and others to call this an excuse for censorship just deflects from the issue at hand - systematic violence against women and girls,\" she said.\"If X defenders really cared about misogyny and child pornography, they'd call on Musk to comply immediately and stop deflecting in bad faith.\"'Highest priority'Ofcom will now examine whether X has failed to take down illegal content quickly when it became aware of it, and taken \"appropriate steps\" to prevent people in the UK from seeing it.It said such illegal content included \"non-consensual intimate images\" and child sexual imagery.It will also check whether X has used \"highly effective age assurance\" measures to stop children from seeing pornographic images.The decision follows global backlash over Grok's image creation feature, with both Malaysia and Indonesia temporarily blocking access to the tool over the weekend.An Ofcom spokesperson did not give an indication on how long the investigation would take but said it would be a \"matter of the highest priority\".\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from content that's illegal in the UK,\" they said.\"We won't hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there's a risk of harm to children.\"Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at Essex University, told the BBC it was \"hard to predict\" how quickly the investigation would move.\"Ofcom has a degree of choice in how fast - or slow - they take the investigation,\" she said.She said the regulator could apply for a business disruption order - a court order to block access to X in the UK - straight away rather than as a last resort, but only in \"rare circumstances\" in response to an ongoing problem.Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University, said the debate around whether X might be blocked in the UK was a \"distraction\".\"Women and girls need action and changes on the ground so that Grok does not produce illegal intimate images and women can get their non-consensual images removed,\" she said.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandNick Eardley,political correspondentFormer Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has become the latest senior Conservative to defect to Reform UK, as a Tory source alleged he had sought a nomination for the House of Lords but was rebuffed.Zahawi, who is a former MP, said he felt the UK had reached a \"dark and dangerous\" moment, and the country needed \"a glorious revolution\", as he outlined why he was joining Nigel Farage's party.Zahawi was chancellor for two months under Boris Johnson and served as a minister from 2018 to 2023, making him the most senior former Tory to join Reform so far. Farage unveiled Zahawi's defection at a press conference on Monday, one of around 20 former Tory MPs to join the party.A Conservative party source later alleged that Zahawi had approached Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch seeking a nomination for a place in the House of Lords.It is claimed Zahawi approached Badenoch on two separate occasions, with the last a few months ago.The source added Zahawi had approached others close to the Conservative leadership more recently.They said it was made clear he would not be on the New Year's Honours list.A source close to Zahawi said: \"Nadhim did not beg for a peerage as they claim - Kemi called him for advice on how to save the party and he decided to join the only party he feels can save Britain.\"Speaking in a pre-recorded video before walking out on stage at the press conference, former minister Zahawi said Britain was \"broken\".He said: \"Nothing works, there is no growth, there is crime on our streets, and there is an avalanche of illegal migration that anywhere else in the world would be a national emergency.\"He added: \"I've made my mind up that the team that will deliver for this nation will be the team that Nigel will put together and that's why I've decided that I'm joining Reform.\"Farage insisted that this latest Tory defection did not mean Reform was becoming the Conservatives 2.0, and said he had fought the party \"tooth and nail\" over Brexit.A Conservative spokesman said Reform was \"fast becoming the party of has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\". \"Their latest recruit used to say he'd be 'frightened to live in a country' run by Nigel Farage, which shows the level of loyalty for sale,\" he said.\"Reform want higher welfare spending and higher taxes. They are a one-man band with no plan for our country. \"Under Kemi Badenoch the Conservatives are demonstrating we have the plan, the competence and the team to get Britain working again.\"When the criticism was put to Zahawi, he replied Badenoch had the \"baggage of a defunct brand\".Farage added there were \"plenty\" of current Conservative MPs asking about joining Reform and some were not being accepted, but he said Zahawi believed \"in what we're doing\" and also has the necessary \"conviction\".As well as his two months as chancellor at the end of Boris Johnson's time as prime minister, Zahawi was education secretary, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and chairman of the Conservative Party.He was sacked from that last position by Rishi Sunak in January 2023 after the prime minister's independent ethics adviser found that he had broken ministerial rules by failing to disclose that his tax affairs were under investigation by HMRC.Asked by the BBC about being sacked over his tax affairs, Zahawi said: \"The mistake I made was not to be specific about my declarations to the Cabinet Office.\"I absolutely think that politicians should be held to a higher level of accountability but I shouldn't be precluded from doing the right thing by my country.\"The Labour Party chair, MP Anna Turley, said Zahawi was \"a discredited and disgraced politician\" who had previously \"repeatedly lambasted his new boss over his divisive and extreme rhetoric\".\"This shameless scurry of yet another failed Tory over to Reform will tell people everything they need to know about both of them,\" she said.And the Liberal Democrat MP in his old constituency of Stratford-on-Avon, Manuela Perteghella, said: \"Reform is becoming a retirement home for disgraced former Conservative ministers.\"Zahawi was a candidate to succeed Johnson as prime minister in 2022 but only attracted the support of 25 of his colleagues and was eliminated in the first round of the leadership contest which Liz Truss won.He was education secretary from September 2021 to July 2022, and his short stint as chancellor of the exchequer came between July and September 2022.In November 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, he was appointed vaccines minister and oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme for nearly a year.Born in Iraq in 1967, he could have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War but instead he and his parents fled Iraq and he grew up in the UK.Questioned on whether he had concerns about allegations of racism made against his new party leader by more than 30 school peers, claims denied by Farage, Zahawi responded: \"If I thought the man sitting next to me had in any way a problem with people of my colour… I wouldn't be sitting next to him.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "Arman Tsarukyan says he was overlooked for an interim lightweight title shot because the UFC \"wants to make\" Paddy Pimblett champion.Liverpool's Pimblett will face American Justin Gaethje for the interim belt on 24 January, with number one contender Tsarukyan snubbed.The match-up was a surprise, considering Gaethje is ranked fourth with Pimblett at number five.Tsarukyan suggested Pimblett's star power secured him the fight.\"They know if they're going to put me against him, he's going to lose and the star is going to be gone,\" said Tsarukyan after he returned to action in a wrestling match over the weekend.\"Gaethje is easy money for him. He's old, he has maybe one or two fights left.\"So that's why they give him the interim title shot because he's not going to be a real champion, because there's Ilia Topuria, and I never think he can beat Ilia Topuria.\"UFC president Dana White has been coy about why he overlooked Tsarukyan for the interim title fight, but did admit the 29-year-old headbutting Dan Hooker at a weigh-in before his last win contributed to the decision.Tsarukyan also pulled out of a title fight with Islam Makhachev in January 2025 in fight week.Lightweight champion Ilia Topuria, 28, is currently taking a break from fighting due to personal reasons surrounding his family.The UFC decided to do an interim bout in his absence and fans would expect Tsarukyan to fight the winner of Gaethje v Pimblett if the interim title holder is upgraded to full champion or if Topuria's return was further delayed.Tsarukyan, however, is pessimistic about 31-year-old Pimblett ever agreeing to fight him.\"I'm a nightmare for him and he knows that if we're going to fight, he's going to lose. He's going to try not to fight me his whole life,\" he said.\"I hope that Justin Gaethje is going to knock him out.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesParents of under-fives in England are to be offered official advice on how long their children should spend watching TV or looking at computer screens.The government says it will publish its first guidance on screen time for the age group in April.It comes as government research was published showing that about 98% of children under two were watching screens on a daily basis - with parents, teachers and nursery staff saying youngsters were finding it harder to hold conversations or concentrate on learning.Children with the highest screen time - around five hours a day - reportedly could say significantly fewer words than those at the other end of the scale who watched for around 44 minutes.How to manage your child's online world without clashingTips and advice from Cbeebies Parenting on how to manage screen timeA national working group led by Children's Commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza and Department for Education scientific adviser Professor Russell Viner will formulate the guidance after speaking to parents, children and early years practitioners.The terms of reference for their work will be published on Monday. The guidance will also help parents come up with alternatives to screen time for their children.The government research showed that at age two, 77% of children in the highest-income families are read to daily, compared with 32% in the lowest-income families.In a statement, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: \"Screens are part of family life now. The question parents are asking isn't whether to use them, but how to use them well.\"Writing earlier in the Sunday Times, Phillipson said: \"Like so many parents, I've had evenings where you give in when your little one wants 'just one more' episode of their favourite show. But we're beginning to see the risks when 'just one more' starts to add up.\"She suggested parents could share a story on a tablet computer or use it for educational games.Felicity Gillespie, director of charitable foundation Kindred Squared, said \"evidence-based\" screentime guidance for parents was \"overdue and very welcome\".Kindred polling suggests that 40% of parents think reducing screen time would help ensure their child is ready for Reception. It says this underlines the demand for practical, trusted guidance in the early years.\"We must increase public understanding of how screens and devices can interfere with the way babies and toddlers learn best, which is by looking at facial expressions, chatting, singing and play,\" Gillespie said.Neil Leitch, from the Early Years Alliance, said he broadly welcomed plans to develop guidance on screen time for under-fives, but added: \"It's important that any such support on this topic sits within a much wider framework of guidance for families and educators on digital literacy and online safety.\"The announcement comes after the Conservatives said they would ban under-16s from accessing social media platforms if they win power, promising to follow the example of Australia, which became the first country to introduce the policy last month.Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott told the Today programme that \"we need to shift the social norm to say children are not safe on social media sites, it is really bad for them\".She called for MPs to back an amendment to the schools bill, which is currently progressing through Parliament, banning smartphones in the classroom.Former prime minister Rishi Sunak, who appeared on BBC Breakfast on Monday to promote his new numeracy charity with his wife Akshata Murty, said the issue was a \"complex\" one, where \"there probably isn't one thing that will make everything better\".\"We need to make sure when kids are at school they are focused on learning and being at school, and not having the distractions of phones and social media in the classroom,\" he added.",

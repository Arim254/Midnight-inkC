It was the maddest gym ever, but it just fitted.\"</p><p>Hatton had become a star in Las Vegas as well as home. He had five fights in boxing's unofficial capital as Hatton gave so many Mancunians an excuse to go to Sin City.</p><p>\"We were lads from a council estate who met up to watch City games together and here we were at after-parties with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt because of Rick,\" said Danny Jackson.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"His-biggest-success-was-his-fans\"><span>'His biggest success was his fans'</span></h2><p></p><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"Ricky Hatton shakes the hand of some of his fans at a pool party in Las Vegas\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/28c3/live/6a37d040-a371-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Hatton fought 18 times in Manchester, winning 17 of those fights</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Hatton was an ambassador for numerous charities, including Manchester-based Barnabus, which helps homeless people, and mental health organisations such as Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM).</p><p>He always wanted to give back.</p><p>\"I would get invited to a whole range of things and events and I would spot in the corner of my eye, across the other side of the room, Ricky just chatting to people,\" said Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester.</p><p>\"I will always think about that when I think about Ricky Hatton.</p><p>\"He was the kind of person who turned up to things.

width=\".75rem\" height=\".75rem\"></svg></a></div></div></div><div><div><p>Available for over a year</p><p>There was an extraordinary moment at the White House on Wednesday when, in front of reporters, secretary of state Marco Rubio handed Donald Trump a note that read the words “very close”, followed by a whisper where he told the president that Israel and Hamas were on the brink of reaching a Gaza ceasefire agreement. \nAlthough there are many details of the plan still being worked on, this could potentially be a pivotal moment. Posting on Truth Social, the president said that all Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be released soon in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israel. \nIn today’s podcast, Sarah and Anthony discuss Donald Trump’s role in the process, how much credit he can personally take, and what it tells us about US foreign policy. \nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Alix Pickles.

    "body": "<p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. </p><p>James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. </p><p>In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".</p></div><div><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. </p><p>\"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"</p><p>The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". </p><p>\"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. </p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"</p></div><div><p>Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,\" James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said.</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p></div>",

When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break.</p><p>The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair.</p><p>When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together.</p><p>Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan.</p><p>In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68528499\">Whale menopause linked to longer lifespan</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61045950\">Mutations across species reveal clue to ageing</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221206-what-naked-mole-rats-can-teach-us-about-treating-cancer\">BBC Future: What naked mole rats can teach us about treating cancer</a></li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chicago Tribune via Getty Images The image shows a naked mole rat - a small, pink rodent - in an undeground burrow eating a chunk of corn on the cob. \" /><span>Chicago Tribune via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Naked mole rats live in a network of underground tunnels and chambers </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Professor Gabriel Balmus studies DNA repair and ageing at the University of Cambridge.

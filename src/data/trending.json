    "body": "Advertising boards & chaos - how Sunderland stopped Arsenal machineMedia caption, Sunderland battle for draw as Arsenal's winning streak endsByGary RoseBBC Sport journalistFor a long while this season, Arsenal have looked an unstoppable force.They arrived at Sunderland on Saturday looking to extend their winning run to 11 consecutive games and keep a club-record ninth clean sheet in a row.Victory would have sent them eight points clear at the top by the end of the day, but the Black Cats that crossed the Gunners' path at the Stadium of Light were set on being disruptive.Regis le Bris' side, the pre-season relegation favourites, have surpassed all expectations on their return to the Premier League and are sitting pretty in the European places for now.They used everything in their power to unsettle and ultimately shock the league leaders, earning a 2-2 draw that will have been celebrated far beyond Wearside.Sunderland scored the first goal Arsenal have conceded since September when Dan Ballard gave them a first-half lead, and although the hosts then slipped 2-1 behind, there was a late twist as Brian Brobbey scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser, sparking wild scenes of celebration on the pitch and in the stands.From moving advertising hoardings to \"creating chaos\", here is how Sunderland achieved such an impressive result.Board games, aggression and 'chaos'Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, The advertising boards around the pitch were moved in to give Arsenal players less space for long throwsArsenal have been known for playing slick, attacking football in the past, but there has been more directness about them this season, with set-pieces proving particularly effective. Long throws have also increasingly been part of their threat.To combat the throw-in danger, Sunderland moved the advertising boards around the edge of the pitch closer in than usual, to limit the amount of space Arsenal players had when looking to launch the ball.\"We tried to find the details to win the game,\" said Le Bris, when asked after the 2-2 draw if that was true.\"They are really strong on set-pieces, we are good as well, and this threat was really important for this game and in the end it was balanced.\"It was indeed more balanced, with Sunderland able to restrict Arsenal to just two corners all game - the same number they had.But it was not just about stopping what Arsenal could do, but also how Sunderland went about the game themselves.Led by their talismanic captain Granit Xhaka - who revelled in disrupting his former team - Sunderland were aggressive and brave in the tackle, unsettling their opponents from the outset.Even after Arsenal had seemingly taken control by scoring twice in the second half after Ballard's first-half opener, Sunderland swarmed forward in the belief that they could find an equaliser.It was delivered by an acrobatic Brobbey finish in the fourth added minute after a clever chip into the penalty area was headed on towards the edge of the six-yard box.It is not the first time Sunderland have got their reward for fighting to the very end, with Saturday's late leveller the fifth goal they have scored from the 90th minute onwards - more than any other Premier League side.\"There are a lot of games like this in the Premier League right now,\" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said.\"We conceded a goal in a manner we knew was one of their biggest strengths. They do that really well.\"After that I think we reacted well. We scored the first goal, then the second and the game was dominated. But in any moment, they just need a foul or a long throw, a direct ball to create that chaos.\"'They never stopped trying' - Sunderland's impressive statisticsSunderland had a plan and stuck to it, but the statistics highlight just how impressive a result it was.Brobbey's equaliser for Sunderland was the first result-altering goal Arsenal have conceded in the 90th minute or later of a Premier League match since September 2024, when John Stones scored in the eighth added minute to make it 2-2 for Manchester City.Ballard's opener – as well as being Sunderland's first shot on target – was the first goal Arsenal had conceded in 812 minutes in all competitions, since Nick Woltemade's strike for Newcastle in September.It was the first time since May 2023 that the Gunners had failed to beat a promoted side in a Premier League match, ending a 14-game winning run against such teams.Arsenal also conceded more than once in a match for the first time this season in all competitions, with 40% of their total goals conceded coming against Sunderland in this game (2/5).\"They never stopped trying, asking questions of Arsenal,\" former Sunderland striker Darren Bent said.\"They kept making Arsenal defend and when the chance came they took it.\"Ex-Arsenal man Ballard epitomises spiritMedia caption, Ballard epitomises Sunderland's toughness - ShearerIt was the two ex-Arsenal men - Xhaka and Ballard - who perhaps epitomised Sunderland's battling spirit best.Xhaka was the leader on the pitch, orchestrating things in the middle, while Ballard drove the opener past David Raya, provided an assist for the equaliser, and made a brilliant block in the final few seconds to prevent Arsenal snatching the win.Ballard started his professional career at the Gunners, having been in the club's academy since the age of eight, but did not make a first-team appearance for them before joining Sunderland in 2022.\"It's a good morale boost to show we can go against a really top team - probably one of the best in Europe at the minute - and delighted with that,\" Ballard told Match of the Day after Saturday's game.\"But it is just one point and we've got a lot of work to do to achieve our goal of staying up this year.\"Former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"Ballard epitomised everything Sunderland have done so well, with his aggression and stopping Arsenal play. \"They are really, really tough to play against and there were so many examples of him and his team putting their bodies in the line. Arsenal will not have many tougher games than that this season, and Sunderland thoroughly deserved the point.\"The draw means Sunderland remain unbeaten at home and they have 19 points from 11 games, well on the way to avoiding relegation as they sit nine points above the bottom three.\"Sunderland went physical today but within the laws of the game, apart from one moment in the first half when Dan Ballard challenged Mikel Merino in the box,\" Match of the Day pundit and former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott said.\"They were well organised and I didn't think they'd be able to keep it up for 90 minutes.\"There's a reason why Sunderland will be fine in this league. The Stadium of Light is not an easy place to play football.\"It was the most rattled I've seen Gabriel and William Saliba this season.\"Just a blip for Arsenal?There is perhaps no harm in title-challenging sides who are on long winning runs being reminded that they are fallible.The Gunners have been brilliant this season, dealing with a lengthy injury list while building a platform from which they can challenge to win the Premier League.Now comes the international break, which serves as a chance to take stock and recover some of their injured players before Tottenham visit in the north London derby on Sunday, 23 November.\"Arsenal won't draw as many as they did last year. If anything it shows resilience to come back the way they did,\" Walcott said.\"Arsenal did almost everything right up until the last few minutes.\"Arteta, too, is not reading too much into the result, choosing to focus on the bigger picture.\"We won the last 10 games, not conceded goals, we have seven players injured and the team has been phenomenal in performances and results, so let's keep going,\" said the manager.\"We've had some very tough games as well. Let's get some players back and go again.\"",

Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "2 hours agoA red poppy features on every front page this morning, with a number of the papers running special editions for Remembrance Sunday. Catherine, Princess of Wales, is front and centre of the Express, photographed wearing a poppy alongside Prince George at the Royal Albert Hall. The paper leads with an exclusive story detailing the Ministry of Defence's announcement that they will cover the costs of veterans making overseas commemoration trips.In the Sunday edition of the Mirror, the paper details its own \"campaign victory\", which they say will see an increased number of veterans who were \"involved in H-bomb testing\" rewarded with a nuclear test medal. Television presenter Davina McCall is pictured on the front page of the Sun, after she revealed on Instagram that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. McCall, 58, said she had found a lump a few weeks ago. She was encouraged to get it examined after seeing posters from Lorraine Kelly's Change + Check campaign that urged women to \"check your breasts\".McCall \"gets 'all-clear' after shock diagnosis\" says the Star, noting that the celebrity says that she will not need chemotherapy following the removal of the cancerous lump in her breast. The Observer's political editor Rachel Sylvester has commented on how Chancellor Rachel Reeves's \"two up, two down\" budget could affect young people in the UK, leading with the headline \"Generation game\".\"BBC to say sorry for doctored Trump speech\" reads the headline on the Sunday Telegraph, referring to concerns in Parliament and elsewhere over a report by the BBC's Panorama programme on US President Donald Trump and the Capitol riot in 2021. BBC chairman Samir Shah is due to \"provide a full response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Monday\", the BBC said.The Times leads with a similar headline: \"BBC's apology for doctoring Trump speech\". Newman's cartoon pokes fun at the recent mistaken prisoner releases, depicting prison guards looking at an Advent calendar with the caption \"All the doors are open\".Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned BBC presenter Nick Robinson for \"claiming bias row is an anti-BBC plot\", the Mail on Sunday reports. Speaking on Radio 4's flagship Today programme on Saturday, Robinson had said there was a \"genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes\" at the BBC but there was also a \"political campaign by people who want to destroy the organisation\".  Johnson called Robinson's remarks \"ridiculous\" and \"arrogant\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "13 hours agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondentPA MediaTwo prisoners are still at large after being mistakenly freed last year, the BBC understands.Another two, who were set free in error in June 2025, also remain missing.Details of the four erroneously released prisoners are emerging as ministers face growing pressure over a number of high-profile mistaken releases.Two other men who were released in error from HMP Wandsworth are now back in custody after high-profile police manhunts this week, after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly set free in late October.Algerian sex offender Brahim Kaddour-Cherif was arrested on Friday, while William Smith handed himself back in at the south London prison on Thursday.Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat and was jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex. He was subsequently recaptured and deported.Some 262 prisoners in England and Wales were mistakenly freed in the year to March - up from 115 the previous year.The names of the four still missing, as well as why they were imprisoned and the reason for their mistaken release, remain unclear.A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson told the BBC: \"The vast majority of offenders released by mistake are quickly brought back to prison, and we will do everything we can to work with the police to capture the few still in the community.\"Earlier, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick had said the unaccounted prisoners revealed \"the incompetence of this government\".\"It shouldn't be left to reporters to uncover the facts. [Justice Secretary] David Lammy must finally come clean about how many prisoners have been accidentally released and how many are still at large.\"Liberal Democrats spokeswoman Jess Brown-Fuller said \"every resource\" must go into finding the prisoners, describing the situation as \"a disgrace and an omnishambles\".The revelation that four wrongly released prisoners remain at large comes just hours after Kaddour-Cherif was arrested following his erroneous release from HMP Wandsworth, in south London, on 29 October.The Algerian national was spotted by a member of the public in the Finsbury Park area of north London shortly before 11:30 GMT, and captured by police just a three-minute walk from where Kebatu had been re-arrested less than a week prior.Kaddour-Cherif had been convicted of indecent exposure in November 2024 in relation to an incident in March of that year, given an 18-month community order and placed on the sex offenders' register for five years.He is understood to have overstayed his visitor's visa to the UK after arriving in 2019, and was in the initial stages of the deportation process.He was released the day after being found not guilty of breaching the sex offenders' register's requirements - but was still facing other charges and should have remained in custody. Police said they were not told for several days.Smith handed himself back in on Thursday. He had been let go on Monday, having been sentenced to 45 months for multiple fraud offences at Croydon Crown Court earlier that day.The BBC understands he was released as a result of a clerical error at court level - with a suspended sentence entered into the computer system instead of a custodial sentence. A correction was made, but sent to the wrong person.Since coming to power last year, the government has adopted a policy of releasing some offenders earlier in their sentence to ease overcrowding.But this appears to have affected the number of prisoners let go by mistake.Lammy said on Friday that the government \"inherited a prison system in crisis\" and said he was personally \"appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing\".He continued: \"I'm determined to grip this problem, but there is a mountain to climb which cannot be done overnight.\"That is why I have ordered new tough release checks, commissioned an independent investigation into systemic failures, and begun overhauling archaic paper-based systems still used in some prisons.\"Correction 8 November 2025: An earlier version of this article said a prisoner had been mistakenly released in March 2024, under the previous Conservative government. Following publication, the BBC was told the release happened at a later, unspecified date in 2024 so these details were removed from the story.",

    "body": "Storm declared 'super typhoon' as it hits Philippines 57 minutes agoKathryn Armstrong and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines AFP via Getty ImagesDozens of families in Remedios T Romualde, on the island of Mindanao, are among those who have been evacuated ahead of the typhoon's arrivalA storm bearing down on the Philippines has been upgraded to super typhoon status, with one outlying island region already experiencing \"life-threatening conditions\". Typhoon Fung Wong will bring sustained winds of 185 km/h (155mph) and torrential rain to several areas on Sunday, according to the country's meteorological service (Pagasa). Catanduanes, an island off the coast of Luzon, was the first part of the Philippines to be directly hit by the storm on Sunday morningTyphoon Fung Wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after an earlier storm, Kalmaegi, left a trail of destruction and nearly 200 dead.Several schools have either cancelled classes on Monday or moved them online, while Philippine Airlines has cancelled a number of local flights ahead of its arrival.Typhoon Fung Wong is expected to weaken rapidly once it makes landfall but will likely remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon. Eastern parts of the Philippines have already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds, a Pagasa official said in a briefing on Saturday evening local time.While much of the country is expected to be impacted, there are particular concerns about those areas that could take a direct hit, including Catanduanes.Residents there, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.In the Aurora region, in the east of the country's largest island, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said local police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm.The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning as residents braced for the typhoon to arrive, which was expected at around midnight.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said we would stay as long as he can to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?Typhoon Fung Wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Watch: Cars pile up on Philippines streets after major flooding from Typhoon KalmaegiThe Philippines government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track the procurement and delivery of essential goods and services to those in need.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi earlier this week has left them even more anxious about the storm to come. \"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge, I live near the shore. The winds there are now very strong, and the waves are huge.\"The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical cyclones, due to its location on the Pacific Ocean where such weather systems form.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which impact the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "Former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson dies aged 687 hours agoAlex Kleiderman and Theo Leggett,correspondentBBCWillson was on Top Gear between 1991 and 2001Jeremy Clarkson and James May have led tributes to fellow Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson, who died on Saturday aged 68.Willson was a co-host on the BBC motoring programme between 1991 and 2001 - presenting alongside the two before Clarkson's revamp of the show - and went on to present Fifth Gear on Channel 5.May, who briefly appeared with Willson on the original Top Gear in the 1990s, called him a \"great bloke\", while Clarkson described him as a \"properly funny man\".The Leicester-born father-of-three - who later worked as a campaigner and electric vehicle (EV) advocate - died after a short battle with lung cancer, his family said in a statement.They described him as a \"national treasure\" and \"true consumer champion\", adding: \"Quentin brought the joy of motoring, from combustion to electric, into our living rooms.\"They went on to say: \"The void he has left can never be filled. His knowledge was not just learned but lived; a library of experience now beyond our reach.\"May, who went on to become part of the revived Top Gear presenting team, wrote on X that Willson \"gave me proper advice and encouragement during my earliest attempts at TV, back in the late 90s\", adding: \"I've never forgotten it.\"Clarkson recalled: \"We had some laughs over the years.\"Willson was Top Gear's used car expert, known for his wry delivery and scathing reviews.In one review from 1998, he described Jaguars as being \"the domain of spivs, crooks and bookmakers\" three decades prior.He also presented The Car's the Star for the BBC and The Classic Car Show on Channel 5, and worked as a motoring journalist for Classic Cars magazine and the Mirror. He was named motoring writer of the year at the British Press Awards in 2004.Willson would later work as a campaigner, fronting the FairFuel group calling for lower fuel duties, and became an early advocate of electric vehicles (EVs).Presenter Vicki Butler-Henderson, who worked alongside Willson on both Top Gear and Fifth Gear, said he was \"very much the champion of the consumer and educated people throughout many car deals, saving people hundreds - if not thousands - of pounds\".She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he had \"made a huge difference\" with his campaigning on fuel duties and \"definitely helped keep money in our pockets for well over a decade\".Tiff Needell, who appeared on Top Gear alongside Willson, wrote on X: \"Oh Quentin how can you leave us so soon. So many memories...\"Willson was partnered with Hazel Newberry on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004Willson was also an early proponent of EVs, lobbying for better infrastructure and lower charging costs through his FairCharge campaign.The family statement highlighted his championing of General Motors' EV1 electric car in the 1990s, saying it proved he was \"always ahead of the curve\".\"More recently he had worked tirelessly to make EVs affordable for all,\" they added.\"Quentin will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and all who knew him personally and professionally.\"AA president Edmund King said he was \"devastated\" by Willson's death, calling him a \"brilliant TV presenter\" and an \"amazing campaigner\".\"He will be missed by all.\"Willson was a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004, where his eight-point total for one routine still stands as the lowest score given by judges on the show.He told the Independent three years later that he was \"very proud\" to have recorded the score. \"Builders ran up to me to shake my hand because I failed so badly. I tried, but I was the dancing equivalent of a JCB,\" the presenter said of his Cha Cha Cha.Willson is survived by his wife, Michaela, his three children and three grandchildren.",

    "body": "1 hour agoOttilie Mitchell and Harry SekulichUS aviation authorities have ordered that all models of a cargo plane which crashed mid-takeoff in Kentucky on Tuesday be grounded.It comes after a Boeing MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS burst into flames on the runway of Louisville International Airport before colliding into neighbouring businesses, killing 14 people. The American delivery firm had earlier said it would not operate the planes pending an ongoing investigation, with FedEx then following suit.Now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a formal notice banning all MD-11 and MD11F aircraft from flying until safety checks are carried out.In total, 70 models are in use with UPS, FedEx and Western Global Airlines.FAA officials said the Kentucky crash happened after the plane's left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.Boeing said it welcomed the directive and that it had already advised the three firms which use the model to stop operating it out of \"an abundance of caution\".It is unclear whether the order will impact delivery services in the US, with none of the three companies reporting disruption so far.Data collated by the live air traffic website FlightRadar24 showed 55 MD-11 planes were used over the past week. \"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement.UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The final passenger flights using an MD-11 was in 2014, with the model used exclusively as a cargo carrier since.The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinTampa Bay TimesA speeding driver lost control of his car and crashed into a bar, killing four and injuring over a dozen othersAn early morning police chase in Tampa, Florida, ended with the \"reckless\" driver crashing into a bar, killing four people and injuring 13 others.In a police pursuit, authorities were unsuccessful at stopping the speeding driver before he lost control of the car and slammed into the bar's outdoor patio, the Tampa Police Department said in a statement. Three victims died on the spot and another died at the hospital, police said. The remaining injuries range from life-threatening to minor, police said. The 22-year-old suspect is in custody and an investigation is underway.The Tampa Police Department's air service first spotted a car driving recklessly on the highway just before 01:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on Saturday morning, the department said in a statement.  After the car, which had previously been seen street racing, got off the interstate, the Florida Highway Patrol began to chase after it as it continued speeding through the city streets. The highway patrol then attempted a \"PIT manoeuvre\", a controversial technique law enforcement use to force a fleeing vehicle to suddenly spin sideways and stop.PIT manoeuvres sometimes result in the deaths of innocent bystanders, the federal government wrote in a 2023 report that urged officers to consider less dangerous pursuit techniques.When the manoeuvre failed, the highway patrol stopped their pursuit and the driver continued speeding on, police said. He then lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a bar named Bradley's, where he hit more than a dozen people who were gathered on the patio, according to police. The bar is a popular LGBTQ spot, but police say there is currently no evidence suggesting that the suspect was targeting any specific individuals or businesses. ReutersThe driver struck the outdoor patio area of a bar called Bradley's on 7thIn addition to the four people killed, 13 were injured, including two in critical condition and seven in stable condition. Two have been discharged from the hospital and two were treated at the scene.Authorities have not released their names.\"What happened this morning was a senseless tragedy, our hearts are with the loved ones of the victims and all those who were impacted,\" Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said in a statement. \"Reckless driving put innocent lives in danger,\" he said. \"The Tampa Police Department and the Florida Highway Patrol are committed to seeking justice for the victims and their families.\"Tampa Mayor Jane Castor called the incident \"devastating\" in a statement on X.\"Families are grieving, first responders are hurting, and our city feels this loss,\" she wrote.

    "body": "15 hours agoAlex KleidermanGetty ImagesTelevision presenter Davina McCall has revealed she underwent surgery for breast cancer nearly three weeks ago.In a video posted to her Instagram account, the Comic Relief host said she was \"very angry\" by the discovery but feels in a \"much more positive place\".McCall, 58, said she found a lump in her breast after checking herself and got it examined, adding: \"It was very, very small, so I got it very, very early which is incredibly lucky. But I am so relieved to have had it removed and to know that it hasn't spread.\"The former Big Brother presenter thanked medical staff at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, where she had the lumpectomy, and urged women to get their breasts checked.It comes a year after McCall underwent surgery to remove a rare brain tumour. A colloid cyst was found during a health check-up as part of her menopause advocacy work and McCall later said she was given the all clear after MRI scans. McCall started her Instagram post by telling her 2.1m followers: \"I'm talking about this because I think it might help someone. And this is what I always do.\"'I'm so relieved', says Davina McCall after breast cancer surgeryShe said she found a lump a few weeks ago which \"came and went\" but was encouraged to get it examined after seeing posters telling women to \"check your breasts\" while working on ITV's The Masked Singer and Lorraine show.She said presenter Lorraine Kelly had put signs on the backs of all the doors saying \"check your breasts\" and \"every time I went for a wee I did that\".\"It [the lump] was still there, and then one morning I saw myself in the mirror and thought \"I'm going to get that looked at\". I had a biopsy. I found out it was indeed breast cancer.\" McCall said she was going to have five days of radiotherapy in January \"as kind of an insurance policy\" and then will be on a \"journey to try and stop it ever coming back\".She added: \"I think my message is: get checked if you're worried. Check yourself regularly. If you are due a mammogram, then get it done.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentBen SoppitBen Soppitt has been raising awareness about the conditions of Iraq's war cemeteriesThis Remembrance Sunday, Ben Soppitt will be honouring the sacrifice of his grandfather at Basra War Cemetery in Iraq. He'll be among the very few, honouring many.His small service will be in stark contrast to the large, solemn ceremony at the Cenotaph in London. Nor do the monuments in Iraq bear any resemblance to the carefully maintained war memorials and manicured cemeteries all across Europe.Ben Soppitt says the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has \"catastrophically failed\" in its duty to honour the dead in Iraq. He says it \"shames the men and women who gave their lives in Iraq\".More than 50,000 soldiers from the UK and Commonwealth nations lost their lives in Iraq in both World Wars. Most were casualties of the Mesopotamian Campaign during World War One, when British and Commonwealth troops fought the Ottoman empire. And most of those killed were Indian nationals.Ben Soppitt's grandfather, Gunner Joseph Soppitt, is among those buried at Basra War Cemetery. He died in 1941 of dysentery when British forces briefly fought there during World War Two. His grave – like the rest of the nearly 3,000 men buried there – has no official marking. Others buried there include a recipient of the Victoria Cross, George Wheeler, and the grandfather of the actress Charlotte Rampling – Sapper Harris Johnson Rampling.Ben SoppittBen Soppitt's grandfather, Gunner Joseph Soppitt, is among those buried at Basra War CemeteryThe Commonwealth War Grave Commission cleared the site of all headstones after many had been vandalised or fallen into disrepair. There is a long-term plan to replace them, but the CWGC withdrew from Iraq in the 1990s for security reasons. Since then, Basra War Cemetery has become a deserted wasteland, used by the locals for football or to dispose of rubbish. Basra is not alone. There are more than a dozen such sites across the country.Some sites have weathered the heat and dust of Iraq better than others. The giant Basra War Memorial nearby, the third largest in the world, is still largely intact. It commemorates more than 40,000 soldiers. 7,385 are individually named on panels – all the British personnel and Indian officers. But 3,256 Indian nationals who served in the ranks are only listed by unit and number.Ben SoppittBasra War Cemetery has become a deserted wasteland with children playing footballCWGC has promised to address this \"inequality in commemoration\", which has favoured British nationals. Ben Soppit says \"this historical wrong cannot be completed without addressing the Indian casualties in Iraq\". He argues that its another compelling reason why it should resume its work there.Over the past two weeks, Ben Soppitt has been visiting most of the CWGC sites in Iraq to honour the dead - but also to highlight what he believes is Britain's failure to do the same. He's been documenting what he's seen on social media.He found the CWGC site in Mosul to be in a similar state to the one in Basra.\"Nothing is left but the pedestals of the memorials and a few of the stones from them,\" he wrote online. \"If my opinion of the CWGC was low before it's reached a new depth\".Ben SoppittOver the past two weeks, Ben Soppitt has been visiting most of the CWGC sites in IraqThe Commonwealth War Grave Commission says it has detailed plans in place to restore its sites in Iraq. It says it has already carried out some renovation work but adds that \"determining the right time to undertake full restoration is a complex judgement\". One of the key determinations, it says, is safety and security in the region. It follows UK foreign office advice for Iraq which currently advises against travel to the country. It says that it keeps the public informed of its work on its website.But there is clearly frustration at the pace of progress. Baroness Emma Nicholson too highlighted the state of the CWGC sites at Basra during one of her visits in 2007. She says she understands that as a government body the CWGC must heed the Foreign Office's travel advice. But she adds they \"must do more\".For Ben Soppitt and his family, the campaign for the CWGC to do more is deeply personal. He had hoped to visit the site of his grandfather's grave in Basra with his own father. But he's now passed away.\"I don't intend to pass this on to my own sons,\" Ben says. \"So I'm doing everything I can to have these men and women properly commemorated before I pass on too.\"",

Their legacy is peace and our duty is to protect it.\"Such sacrifice deserves more than silence, which is why this government remains committed to supporting veterans, their families and those who serve.\"Today, we remember, and we renew our promise to uphold the values they fought for.\"",

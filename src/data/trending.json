Early voting has begun in the primaries and Democrats are hopeful they could win a Texas senate seat for the first time in over 30 years. \nThe election will have national consequences - Texas is one of America’s political power centres, and Republicans from here have dominated the national agenda from immigration, to the courts, to reshaping electoral districts.  Taking back Texas could help Democrats take back the House, the Senate, and check Trump’s executive power in a way they have so far been unable to do in his second term.  It could also realign the presidential election in 2028.  \nJustin and Anthony - who grew up in Texas and knows its politics well - unpack the primaries, which are fast becoming the most expensive in modern US history.  On the Republican side, there is meltdown and infighting, as Senator John Cornyn faces a serious challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton.  The US president - who is campaigning in Texas - hasn’t yet endorsed one candidate. \nOn the Democrat side, two of its biggest stars are fighting for the nomination.  Jasmine Crockett, well known for her fiery public battles with the Trump administration and James Talarico, who is tipped as a future Democrat presidential candidate.  We look at what their realistic chances are, and what it tells us about the future of the party.  \nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Grace Reeve, Sophie van Brugen and Kris Jalowiecki.

Carol, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do, Bad Blood, Laughter in the Rain and Calendar Girl, has died at the age of 86.\"Our family is devastated by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father and grandfather,\" his family confirmed in a statement.  \"A true rock and roll legend, an inspiration to millions, but most importantly, at least to those of us who were lucky enough to know him, an incredible human being who will be deeply missed.\"Sedaka, a skilled pianist nominated for five Grammy awards, also wrote hits for several other famous musicians in his six-decades-long career. His family did not disclose his cause of death or where he died.The Brooklyn native and student of the famed Julliard School in New York was a founder of the doo-wop group The Tokens in the late 1950s. After producing several hits through the early 1960s, he later returned to Billboard's Top 10 chart in 1975 after writing the song Love Will Keep Us Together for duo Captain & Tennille. He also recorded several albums for Elton John's record label in the 1970s.He wrote his first hit song with his neighbour while still a teenager. Connie Francis recorded and released \"Stupid Cupid\" in 1958. Sedaka's popular music faded from the spotlight later in the 1960s, as the British Invasion era took hold of the US.\"It's wonderful for the soul to be able to play classical music,\" he said.\"But to travel around, playing your own lyrics and music is a very rewarding feeling and I chose that, and I have no regrets.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersParty observers watch as votes are counted for the Gorton and Denton by-electionNigel Farage has reported allegations of \"family voting\" at the Gorton and Denton by-election to Greater Manchester Police and the Electoral Commission.The Reform UK leader is urging an investigation into reports by independent election observers of \"extremely high\" levels of family voting.Family voting is where a family member is seen to be influencing somebody else's vote, for example by entering the polling booth with them.Concerns were raised by Democracy Volunteers, a group of voluntary election observers who check voting processes are being followed correctly.The Electoral Commission said it took the claims \"very seriously\" and would \"carefully consider\" the report.A statement from the organisation, which oversees elections in the UK, said: \"We are in close contact with the returning officer and Greater Manchester Police to speedily and carefully review the concerns that have been raised and all the information available.\"Greater Manchester Police said in a statement: \"We can confirm a report has been made. We are in the process of reviewing this report and will provide a further update in due course.\"Reform UK were beaten into second place by the Green Party by more than 4,000 votes at the by-election but Farage has claimed it was \"a victory for sectarian voting and cheating\".He said: \"Reform has today reported the many cases of 'family voting' to the Electoral Commission and the police.\"What was witnessed yesterday is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas.\"If this is what was happening at polling stations just imagine the potential for coercion with postal votes.\"If action isn't taken now, then we will ensure it is after the next general election.\"In a letter to the elections watchdog, Farage urged them to launch a full investigation and to work with police \"with a view to prosecutions\" and to \"assess whether the extent of the irregularities is such that the validity of the election result may be called into question\".Earlier, the Green Party hit back at Reform's criticisms, with a spokesman saying: \"This is an attempt to undermine the democratic result and is straight out of the Trump playbook.\"We've just won a historic by-election by a comfortable margin.\"We've shown the country that Greens can beat Reform, despite their big business donations.\"Gorton and Denton by-electionThe Conservative Party, which came a distant fourth in the by-election, have also written to the Electoral Commission to ask for a full investigation into the Democracy Volunteers' allegations.In a letter to the watchdog, shadow communities secretary James Cleverly said: \"There is clear evidence that electoral offences were committed and a blind eye was turned to corruption and criminal activity.\"Family voting was effectively made illegal through the Ballot Secrecy Act 2023, which made it a criminal offence to be in or near a polling booth with another person in order to influence them to vote in a particular way.While Tower Hamlets in east London has been the focus of multiple allegations of family voting in recent years, Democracy Volunteers has repeatedly described the issue as \"widespread\" across all parts of the UK in its reports.Democracy Volunteers director John Ault issued a statement after polls had closed on Thursday, saying observers had seen \"the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10 year history of observing elections in the UK\".He said: \"We rarely issue a report on the night of an election, but the data we have collected today on family voting, when compared to other recent by-elections, is extremely high.\"In the other recent Westminster parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby we saw family voting in 12% of polling stations, affecting 1% of voters. \"In Gorton and Denton, we observed family voting in 68% of polling stations, affecting 12% of those voters observed.\"The group said four observers attended 22 of the 45 polling stations in the constituency, spending 30 to 45 minutes in each.Of the 22 polling stations observed, volunteers reported potential family voting in 15.They observed a sample of 545 individuals casting their vote and saw 32 cases of family voting in total, including nine cases in one polling station.The official responsible for running the by-election rejected the claims, saying no reports of family voting had been made by polling station staff.A spokesperson for the acting returning officer said polling station staff are trained to \"look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters\" and said \"no such issues\" were reported on Thursday.They said: \"If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken. \"We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police - who had a presence at every polling station - where necessary.\"It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.\"Democracy Volunteers responded by saying it followed the \"international best practice of not interfering with the electoral process\" and issued its findings after voting closed to \"ensure we did not disrupt the administration of the election\".The group signalled it was not planning to report incidents to the police, telling the BBC \"it is not our job to administer the elections, purely to observe\".They added: \"We saw police present in many polling stations yesterday to check whether staff were having any issues.\"Labour Party chairwoman Anna Turley told BBC Newsnight reports of family voting in the Gorton and Denton by-election were \"extremely worrying and concerning\". \"We need to see the evidence and the report, and then make due decision about what authorities should look into this,\" she added.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLabour's \"crushing by-election defeat\" leads the Times, which reports that pressure grows on Primer Minister Sir Keir Starmer to shift the party to the left after losing in Gorton and Denton to the Greens. It adds that ministers are saying \"they believe it is now 'inevitable' that Starmer will not lead Labour into the election\". Sir Keir has said he would not step down and would continue to fight \"for as long as I've got breath in my body\", it reports.The fallout from Labour's loss in Gorton and Denton features on the front page of the Daily Mail. It reports that after the result of the by-election, police are being \"urged to investigate 'clear evidence' of voter fraud\", which comes \"Amid warnings that Britain is 'sleepwalking into sectarian politics'\". \"Green delight sparks nightmare for Labour\" runs across the top of the Guardian. Its main front page story says: \"Keir Starmer is facing an ultimatum from his own party to change direction of face a leadership challenge within months.\" It describes the  loss to the Greens in the by-election as a humiliation that plunges Labour politicians into \"renewed despair\".The Daily Telegraph frames its coverage of the by-election with a report that opens: \"Labour must push ahead with a crackdown on migration despite the Green party's by-election victory, Shabana Mahmood will urge next week.\" Under a large image of Hannah Spencer, the new Greens MP in Gorton and Denton, are an article saying Britain closes its embassy in Iran and another headlined: \"Millions of electric car drivers spied on through their phones\".The FT Weekend opens its coverage of the by-election by reporting: \"Sir Keir yesterday saw his political strategy shattered.\" It also says there are calls from within Labour to shift the party to the left. The front page carries a report saying the US, UK and other countries have ordered some citizens and diplomats to leave the Middle East over fears \"a Trump administration attack on Iran could spiral into a regional conflict\".Intense pressure mounts on Sir Keir to move the Labour party to the left \"or resign\" after the by-election result, the i Weekend reports. Its headline says Angela Rayner \"leads new threat\" to the prime minster, with MPs warning \"it's terminal\". Calling the former deputy prime minister a \"leadership rival\", the i Weekend runs quotes from her on the front page in which she \"openly calls on party to 'wake up' and 'be braver'\".Referring to the job of Hannah Spencer, the plasterer and plumber who won Gorton and Denton for the Greens, the Daily Star runs a large headline reading: \"Plaster la vista Starmer\". A smaller headline running underneath states: \"Labour throws in trowel as Greens win\".  \"Wake-up call\" runs as a large headline across the front page of the Daily Mirror, which is also leading with coverage of the \"by-election blow\". It opens its report on the Gorton and Denton by-election: \"Keir Starmer vowed to keep fighting for change after the Green Party stunned Labour in a crucial by-election.\" A large image of a vandalised statue of Winston Churchill sits next to a prominent headline reading: \"How dare you!\" splashed across the front of the Daily Express. An underlined subheading sates: \"Arrests as vile vandal defaces statue of British hero who helped save our freedoms\". A story about child killer Ian Huntley's condition dominates the front page of the Sun. It is headlined \"He's battered beyond recognition\" above a report that says his mum visited him in hospital secretly and told friends he was \"unrecognisable\" after being attacked in prison with a metal pole and left with a crushed skull.\"Green delight sparks nightmare for Labour\" declares the Guardian. It says the \"scale of the defeat in an area that had returned Labour MPs for nearly a century\" has plunged ministers and MPs into \"renewed despair\". The weekend edition of the i says Sir Keir Starmer is now under \"intense pressure to shift his party to the left or resign\". But a cabinet ally has told the FT Weekend that the prime minister will \"definitely fight on\", and that Labour should stick to its economic plan and not plunge into a divisive \"left versus right leadership battle\".The editorial pages offer little solace for the prime minister. The Daily Telegraph says \"Sir Keir's already fragile control of his party is threatened again\". The Times says the \"government's total lack of a compelling, upbeat story on the economy has opened the door to the politics of despair and envy\". The Daily Mirror says \"voters sent a message Labour cannot afford to shrug off\" while the Sun looks ahead to future elections, saying \"Britain now has genuine five-party politics\". It believes it will be \"harder than ever for any single party to win a majority at the next general election\".The Daily Mail says the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has demanded action, after poll monitors raised concerns about \"family voting fraud\" in the by-election. And The Daily Star highlights the fact that the new Green MP is a plasterer. Its front page pictures Hannah Spencer at work - with the headline \"Plaster La Vista Starmer\".Away from politics, the front page of the Daily Express features the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square that has been defaced with graffiti.

    "body": "8 hours agoCaroline LowbridgeEast MidlandsPlatform Home OwnershipFormer police officer Phil James - pictured here receiving a cheque on behalf of the charity - founded Drone to Home and was its CEOThe charity regulator for England and Wales has reported its concerns about an animal charity to police in line with its \"policy on evidence of potential criminal activity\".The Charity Commission's report comes after former Drone to Home volunteers told the BBC the charity had been exaggerating how many dogs it finds in what they described as an attempt to increase donations and sponsorship.Drone to Home was founded by former Nottinghamshire Police officer Phil James in 2022 and quickly became well-known, with more than 154,000 Facebook followers and widespread media coverage.The BBC has asked James and the charity's remaining trustee to comment but they have not responded.Four women said they felt intimidated when James followed them around and filmed themDrone to Home announced its intention to close on 22 November, after the BBC sent James and the charity a \"right of reply\" letter, outlining allegations we were intending to report and the testimony gathered from former volunteers.However, the regulator said its role was to \"oversee trustees' compliance with charity law duties and responsibilities\", and \"not to investigate allegations of a criminal nature\".A Charity Commission spokesperson said: \"After concerns were raised with us about Drone to Home, we opened a regulatory compliance case to assess these further and gather more information.\"In line with our policy on evidence of potential criminal activity, we reported our concerns to the police.\"Based on the information available to us, we have since determined there is no further role for the Commission as charity regulator. However, we continue to engage with the charity on its closure.\"Sadie accused Drone to Home of misleading Facebook followersIt claimed to have reunited thousands of dogs and other pets with their owners, and was largely funded by donations from the public.However, four former Drone to Home volunteers claimed to the BBC the charity had been exaggerating how many dogs it reunited with owners.Volunteers from other animal search and rescue (SAR) organisations also told the BBC they thought the charity had been using Facebook posts to falsely give the impression it was responsible for finding lost dogs that had been found by other rescue groups.Volunteer drone pilot Kevin Gunn played an answerphone message James left for his employerNumerous people also raised concerns about the behaviour of James.Four women - including one former Drone to Home volunteer - told the BBC they felt intimidated when he followed them around and filmed them as they helped in the search for a lost dog in Long Clawson in Leicestershire.In another incident, James contacted a volunteer drone pilot's employer and left a voicemail falsely accusing him of \"abusing my staff on social media\".Another former Drone to Home volunteer was also sent a fake legal letter, accusing her of defamation after she raised concerns about the charity with a friend.It purported to be from a barristers' chambers called 7BR, which told the BBC it had \"reported this incident to the police on the basis that someone appears to have fraudulently misused the 7BR letterhead\".The BBC asked Drone to Home and James about all of these matters, and he responded by disputing the claims and threatening the corporation with legal action.The letter appeared to originate from the 7BR barristers' chambers, which has reported the matter to policeThe charity's Facebook page closed on 24 November and the website closed on 20 December.The Charity Commission said it intended to dissolve the charity after three months from 5 February, which was the date it published a notification on its register.The charity has been reported to Nottinghamshire Police by the Charity Commission. Nottinghamshire Police declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesThe family of a black woman whose cervical cells were harvested in 1951 without her knowledge and replicated infinitely ever since has reached a settlement with a second biotech company.The Switzerland-based company Novartis was accused in a lawsuit of profiting from Henrietta Lacks' cells, which were taken without consent but have enabled huge advances in medical science.Lacks' family never received any compensation, and have fought for years to get justice for the \"stolen\" cells.Nearly three years ago, the family settled with another biotech company, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, for undisclosed terms. Lacks, a 31-year-old mother from Baltimore, Maryland, began experiencing pain in her abdomen and abnormal bleeding in 1951. She was examined by gynaecologists at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who discovered a large mass on her cervix.Without informing her or asking for permission, doctors sent a sample of her tumour to a lab for medical research before treating her for aggressive cervical cancer.But, while nearly all cell cultures died quickly in the lab, those taken from Ms Lacks continued to multiply and didn't age, making them \"immortal\". This meant that scientists all over the world could replicate experiments using identical cells.The cell line, called \"HeLa\" after the patient's first and last name, was sent to research labs around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HeLa cells have led to the creation of the polio vaccine and advancements in HIV, cancer and infertility research.But the same properties that made the cells a scientific miracle also made them lethal. Months after her diagnosis, Lack died from cancer at just 31 and was buried in an unmarked grave.Seventy years after her death, her family filed a lawsuit against Novartis in the  state of Maryland. Several other lawsuits against other drug companies remain ongoing.The details of the latest settlement have not been disclosed.\"Members of the family of Henrietta Lacks and Novartis are pleased they were able to find a way to resolve this matter filed by Henrietta Lacks's estate outside of court,\" said a joint statement by her family and Novartis. \"The terms of the agreement are confidential.\"A lawyer for her family, Ben Crump, told the New York Times that the family members are satisfied by the settlement.\"For the family and her grandchildren, this is certainly justice because people said they would never realize any benefit or compensation from her immortal HeLa cells, even though these pharmaceutical companies were profiting billions and billions of dollars,\" he said.He described the agreement as \"some measure of justice, to offer respect and dignity to the life that was taken\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivWatch: Crowds clash with police after Bolivian plane crashAt least 15 people have been killed and others injured after a Bolivian air force cargo plane crashed in the western city of El Alto, the country's authorities say.The incident happened at 18:15 local time (22:15 GMT) on Friday as the plane was arriving at El Alto's airport from the city of Santa Cruz, aviation officials said. It reportedly skidded off the runway and hit nearby vehicles.The defence ministry later confirmed its C-130 Hercules was involved and that it had been transporting banknotes to the Central Bank of Bolivia. There were eight people aboard the plane, the air force commander said.Police fired tear gas to disperse crowds allegedly trying to take the scattered banknotes.Video footage showed the plane on the ground and badly damaged vehicles. In other videos, people could be seen running away from the tear gas and police officers, some holding shields, forming a line. Some in the crowds are seen throwing rocks. \"While news crews were covering the accident, individuals attempting to steal the transported money attacked the press with unusual violence,\" the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia said in a statement. It said a mobile TV unit was \"directly targeted\", while other journalists \"were attacked with stones, suffering serious injuries while carrying out their work\". The government-run Bolivian News Agency reported that at least a dozen people were arrested for stealing banknotes.  ReutersBolivian banknotes were seen scattered at the crash site\"I want to make it clear to those who are trying to take money from the plane involved in this tragedy that this money has no legal value since it has not been issued by the Central Bank and does not have a serial number, and that attempting to use this money is a crime,\" the Minister of Defence, Marcelo Salinas, said. \"We also ask all those who are engaging in acts of vandalism in this area to refrain from doing so and to respect the mourning and grief we are experiencing at this difficult time.\"Bolivia's Air Force commander Sergio Lora confirmed there were eight crew members on board the plane \"including cargo personnel and flight crew\".Bolivia's health ministry said 31 people were injured in the incident. It also issued an urgent appeal for blood donations. El Alto International Airport was temporarily closed following the crash.\"My sister told me that she was in the car when the plane crashed. The plane's tire fell on the car, and my sister was injured because the impact of the tire hit her on the head, so we rushed her to the hospital,\" a man told the Reuters news agency.It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, but some witnesses said the  weather at the time was treacherous.\"A heavy hailstorm\" was falling and \"there was lightning\" when the plane went down,\" a woman whose car was struck by the aircraft wreckage told the AFP news agency.An investigation into the incident is under way.",

    "body": "Blind refugee found dead in New York after being released by immigration authorities5 hours agoAna FaguyBuffalo Police DepartmentA nearly-blind, non-English-speaking refugee from Myanmar has been found dead in upstate New York after being released from federal immigration custody.Nurul Amin Shah Alam was found dead on Tuesday, days after US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) dropped him off at a coffee shop miles from his home in Buffalo, where temperatures have been below freezing.Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan called Shah Alam's death \"deeply disturbing\" and called for an investigation. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said the man had accepted a courtesy ride to the shop and showed \"no signs of distress, mobility issues, or disabilities requiring special assistance\" when he was dropped off.The department said that the coffee shop was closer to his home compared to being released \"directly from the Border Patrol station\" and it was determined to be \"a warm, safe location\". The Washington Post posted a video from outside the Tim Horton's coffee shop where he is thought to have been dropped off. It is date-stamped 19 February appears to show Shah Alam walking by and not going inside. The Washington Post reported it was recorded after the restaurant had closed.The shop closes at 19:00 local time, according to its posted hours. Weather reports from that night show the temperature was forecast around 36F (2.2C) Shah Alam's cause of death has not been made public and the Buffalo Police Department is investigating what happened to the 56-year-old.  He was found dead on 24 February, nearly 6mi (9.7km) from the coffee shop, according to Buffalo police. A passerby called 911 to report seeing a man wearing khaki pants and a dark parka who did not appear to be moving or breathing, although he had been moving when she had walked by three hours earlier, police said.Before his death, Shah Alam had been in local police custody for nearly a year on assault and weapons charges related to an incident in which two police officers were injured, according to police. He had been released on bail after reaching a plea deal, according to local media reports. US immigration authorities had placed a detainer on him as part of that case, which is a request for someone who is a non-US citizen to be taken into their custody should they be released.  According to a timeline provided by the Buffalo Police Department, Shah Alam's lawyer reported him missing on 22 February, saying he had been released to federal authorities on 19 February and had no identification. Shah Alam's son told police he believed his father had been held by federal authorities starting 19 February.Reuters reported that CBP released him from their custody after finding he entered the US as a refugee and could not be deported legally.Shah Alam's family has said they weren't notified of when or where Shah Alam had been dropped off. The BBC has contacted the CBP for comment.In a news conference, Mayor Ryan said that Border Patrol, DHS and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \"don't know what they're doing\" and offered a blistering summary of what happened to the refugee, who reportedly entered the US in December 2024.\"The Border Patrol officers had no protocol of what to do with the disabled man who doesn't speak English, who is confused and lost,\" he said. \"And you know what they did? They dropped him at a closed coffee shop.\"One of Shah Alam's children, Mohamad Faisal, said in a text message to Reuters that their family was not notified about his release at the coffee shop. \"Nobody told me or my family or attorney where my dad was dropped off,\" Faisal told Reuters.He said his father's arrest last year was due to a misunderstanding with police officers.  His father, he said, had been out for a walk and was using a curtain rod as a walking stick. When Shah Alam got lost and walked onto the property of a Buffalo resident, they called the police. Shah Alam, who doesn't speak English, could not understand police commands to drop the curtain rod and he was arrested, Faisal said.Video from body-worn cameras released by Buffalo police shows the man holding two black rods when officers appear, and repeatedly saying \"sorry.\" When he does not drop the rods after repeated requests to do so, the officer deploy tasers, and he walks forward swinging the rods until one officer wrestles him to the ground.Shah Alam was excited to come back to his son's house to \"eat home-cooked food\" and \"be united with the rest of [his] family,\" Faisal said.The family are Arakan Rohingya refugees, he added.Local officials are now asking for an investigation into Shah Alam's death. New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office is \"reviewing our legal options\". \"Nurul Amin Shah Alam fled genocide and came to this country in search of safety and opportunity,\" she said in a statement. \"Instead, his life was tragically cut short. No one who comes here seeking refuge should be left in harm's way.\"",

The Greens have also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work.But a source close to Mahmood has told the BBC that the government should not learn the wrong lessons from the by-election result - and that it was \"wrong\" to assume Muslim voters were deserting Labour over immigration. If some in Labour are now queasy about the home secretary's approach, sources are suggesting that the alternative is the \"far right raising up the drawbridge\" and putting in jeopardy the future of the asylum system - and even of the Labour Party itself.Shabana Mahmood herself has said that illegal immigration was putting immense strain on the country and undermining the contract between the government and its citizens.This week, Mahmood visited reception and removal centres for asylum seekers near Copenhagen, the Danish capital, to examine how a tougher set of policies were working in practice. Danish government policies influenced Labour's proposals for asylum reform last autumn,  and the home secretary is expected to begin implementing some of them from next week.These include making most migrants wait for up to 10 years - rather than the current five – before being able to apply for permanent residence, with refugees waiting for up to 20 years. The proposals also included offering only temporary protection to those whose asylum claims have been accepted - and reducing the number of appeals that unsuccessful applicants can lodge. 'All talk'Mahmood is expected to double down on her approach in a speech next week.She will seek to make a \"Labour case\" for \"firm and fair\" Danish-style immigration policies, which are aimed at reducing incentives for people to enter the UK illegally.Left-wing Labour MPs have called for a change of approach.Richard Burgon – of the Socialist Campaign Group – told the BBC it was time to \"ditch the approach of aping Reform and kicking the left which has alienated so many people who have voted Labour previously\".Imran Hussain, from the Refugee Council, a charity, was sceptical about proceeding with new asylum and immigration rules.He said that \"the big lesson of recent years was that tough talking\" did not lead to \"smart action\" and the government should instead focus on the \"basics\" - swifter asylum decisions, swifter appeals and help for refugees to integrate.Reform UK's home affairs spokesman Zia Yusuf said Mahmood was \"all talk and no action,\" and the government could not fix the immigration system while it was \"chained\" to the European Convention on Human Rights (EHCR).He said a Reform government would leave the ECHR immediately and \"completely abolish indefinite leave to remain\", as well as imposing visa bans on countries refusing returns and \"criminalise aiding illegal entry, regardless of intent\".

    "body": "17 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentLightRocket via Getty ImagesThe Green Party's winning candidate Hannah Spencer addressed the press after winning the by-electionThere are so many implications of the Gorton and Denton by-election that are essential to understand, but it's best first to dwell on the winner: the Greens.The closest they had come to winning a Westminster by-election before was in 2023 in a seat in Somerset where they got about 10% of the vote and finished third.Blasting away one of Labour's biggest majorities shows that under the more left-populist leadership of Zack Polanski, the Greens are now playing in a different political league.Polanski and the party's new MP, Hannah Spencer, were explicit that they do not see this as a self-contained local contest but as the blueprint for all sorts of other parts of the country.The fear among plenty of Labour MPs is that they are right. Labour politicians have over the past year or so become comfortable with the idea that Reform UK could usurp the Conservatives as the main force on the right of British politics.Now they are confronted with the niggling possibility that something similar could be happening on their side of the political spectrum too.It is much too soon to assert that this is likely or even plausible. But it certainly is possible, and that is part of the reason why this by-election may linger long in the memory.As it stands - and that is an important caveat - there are no signs that result in Greater Manchester will precipitate another Labour leadership wobble in the immediate term. Getty ImagesGreen Party leader Zack Polanski was also present to celebrate the win with SpencerEven a Labour MP who messaged me about Sir Keir Starmer in the aftermath of the result simply saying \"time to go\" took the view that any change should happen after the May elections rather than now.Nevertheless, the call from Angela Rayner, Sir Keir's former deputy, for Labour to take this as a \"wake up call\" and become \"braver\" was notably forthright.A word about the Conservatives. Gorton and Denton was not their natural terrain and tactical voting was rife, but even so getting just 700 or so votes and losing their deposit is a bleak omen. The party which was in government less than two years ago ended up about 14,000 votes behind the winner and only 547 votes ahead of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's \"Sir Oink A-Lot\".It's worth remembering that this is the second by-election since the 2024 general election. Yes, it is fairly typical for governing parties to get a kicking in by-elections. But taken together, along with the Conservatives' political no-shows in both contests, these by-elections point to a new dynamic of surging political forces to the traditional parties' left and right.",

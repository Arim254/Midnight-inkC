I enjoyed it.\"Residents were able to stroke and hold Pringle and WidgetThe medium-sized birds are based at Heythrop Zoological Gardens in Oxfordshire, a privately-owned zoo, which aims to educate on animal welfare. They visit care homes and hospices across the country.Luke Fillary, head bird keeper, was on hand at the home to provide instructions on how to interact with the birds to keep them and the residents safe.The 21-year-old handler said Pringle and Widget had been trained their entire lives to become therapy penguins.\"They both have been born at our zoo, so they have been in training their whole life,\" he said.\"Officially, they have been doing it for the past six years. Both are very well behaved.\"Jackie Kirkham visited her 91-year-old dad Derek when the penguins arrivedResidents of the care home also had the opportunity to invite their families along to meet the penguins.Jackie Kirkham, from Clifton in Nottingham, came to visit her 91-year-old dad Derek.She said: \"It's just something new for them, something that they probably won't be doing. He enjoys it and we do - it's comforting.\"The care home invites other therapy animals for residents to encounter.Bridget Peck, wellbeing coordinator at the home, said she had seen the benefit in bringing animals to the residents.\"I think animals play an important role for everybody's wellbeing,\" she said.\"Not just dogs - we have donkeys, ponies, every Easter we have the ducks and chickens come in. So penguins, why not? It was great.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "Multi-cancer blood test missed key goal in NHS trial12 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesA blood test which looks for multiple types of cancer has failed to achieve its key objective in a major NHS trial, the company has announced.The Galleri blood test is being trialled on 142,000 NHS patients with the goal of finding cancers early and saving lives.However, the company behind the test, Grail, said there were still positive signs in the data that some of the most aggressive cancers could be prevented.But researchers said any benefits of the test \"remain speculative\" until it was proven to save lives and the NHS said it was looking at the results \"carefully\".The blood test searches for fragments of DNA – or genetic code – that have escaped from tumours and entered the bloodstream.The vision is to detect up to 50 types of cancer before the person has any symptoms.At the start of the clinical trial, NHS England described the test as \"the beginning of a revolution\".The trial was designed to see if screening people's blood would reduce the number of cancers being diagnosed at later stages when they may be harder to treat.Stage three cancers are when a tumour has started to spread locally, stage four is when they have spread to distant organs in the body too.The full data from the three-year NHS trial has not been published, but Grail has issued an update to investors.It said: \"While there was a trend towards reduction in combined stage three and four [cancers], the trial did not meet the primary endpoint.\"Grail, a US pharmaceutical company, halved in value after the announcement taking its share price back to levels seen at the end of the summer.However, a further analysis looking at stage four cancers alone showed they fell by around a fifth in the study, suggesting the most deadly cancers were being detected at an earlier stage.How much attention should be paid to this result, when it was not the main focus of the trial, has become a major debating point.Prof Charles Swanton, who is running the trials within the NHS, told the BBC he was \"genuinely very excited\" about the reduction in stage four cancers.\"I've been working in oncology for 20 years and the key, in my mind, is to reduce stage four because these are the cancers we cannot cure,\" he said.However, other experts say the focus has to be on the primary endpoint as that is what the trial was designed to test.Prof Richard Houlston, from the Institute of Cancer Research, said: \"Without mortality data and a transparent account of harms, including false positives, unnecessary procedures, and opportunity cost, claims of population benefit from multi-cancer early detection remain speculative,\" he said.The full data is due to be presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this year.An NHS spokesperson said: \"This evidence is an important step and the NHS will carefully study the full results from this major trial in the coming months to help determine how blood tests like this could be used in the future.\"",

Teams were tasked with illustrating the theme of fair play and Unwin said the sculpture she designed was \"ridiculously complicated\".She said: \"It was so difficult to work it out but we did actually do it.\"At about four o'clock on the last day, I was sort of thinking: 'I don't know if it's going to work,' but it did. \"It was a bit rough around the edges, but it was snowing quite a bit, so it covered up the mistakes.\"She added: \"We came second which is just very exciting because there were some really good ones.\"Living in Devon she is unable to practice with snow but, as a stone sculptor by trade, she said carving both was a similar practice. \"Stone is obviously harder and, generally, I'm working much smaller, but it's taking stuff off to create the sculpture, so it's very much the same technique.\"More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "49 minutes agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least eight of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes are among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck \"Hezbollah command centres\" and that Hezbollah \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government said Israel's ongoing actions were a violation of the ceasefire deal and urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. The Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

    "body": "9 hours agoOttilie MitchellReutersEight people were killed in a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia earlier in FebruaryOpenAI banned a ChatGPT account owned by the suspect of a mass shooting in British Columbia more than half a year before the attack took place.The AI company said they had identified an account owned by Jesse Van Rootselaar in June 2025 under abuse and enforcement detection, which includes identifying accounts being used to further violence.OpenAI said it did not alert authorities to the account because its usage did not meet its threshold of a credible or imminent plan for serious physical harm to others.It said its thoughts were with everyone affected by the tragedy and that following the attack it had \"proactively\" contacted Canadian police with information on the suspect.Van Rootselaar is suspected of having shot and killed eight people in rural Tumbler Ridge on 12 February in one of the deadliest attacks in Canada's history. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, \"about a dozen staffers debated whether to take action on Van Rootselaar's posts.\"Some had identified the suspect's usage of the AI tool as an indication of real world violence and encouraged leaders to alert authorities, the US outlet reported. But, it said, leaders of the company decided not to do so.In a statement, a spokesperson for OpenAI said: \"In June 2025, we proactively identified an account associated with this individual [Jesse Van Rootselaar] via our abuse detection and enforcement efforts, which include automated tools and human investigations to identify misuses of our models in furtherance of violent activities.\"They said the company would continue to support the police's investigation.The BBC has contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for comment.OpenAI has said it will uphold its policy of alerting authorities only in cases of imminent risk because alerting them too broadly could cause unintended harm. It has also said that it trains ChatGPT to discourage imminent real-world harm when it identifies a dangerous situation and to refuse to help people that are attempting to use the service for illegal activities.The company added that it is constantly reviewing its referral criteria with experts and that it is reviewing the case for improvements. The deadly attack on Tumbler Ridge Secondary School saw a further 27 people injured.Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school. Police said the suspect was born a biological male but identified as a woman.Van Rootselaars's mother and step-brother were among the victims of the shooting. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.The motive for the attack is not yet known.",

    "body": "33 minutes agoImogen JamesTrade envoy role explained by BBC business editorThe Business and Trade Committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss launching an inquiry into the role of UK trade envoys following Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.The former prince was arrested by Thames Valley Police on Thursday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and released under investigation 11 hours later.The cross-party committee will discuss options after allegations that Andrew shared confidential government files while he was in the role, but will avoid focusing on him while he is involved in a police investigation.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein; he has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on the specific allegations in relation to the release of millions of Epstein files in January.MPs on the committee will also look into the appointment and accountability of UK trade envoys.It is understood that any inquiry would start with a focus on possible governance issues within the wider system.There are currently 32 envoys across six continents, who play \"a crucial role in supporting the Department for Business and Trade's growth priorities\", according to the government website.Duties include engaging with host governments, leading trade delegations, and meeting businesses in the UK. Liam Byrne, chair of the committee, said earlier in the week that the MPs will also discuss a potential investigation into Andrew for his conduct in the role. MPs are taking the allegations \"acutely seriously\", Byrne said.Emails released in the latest tranche of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have caused significant controversy for the former Duke of York.In 2010, Andrew is alleged to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein.Meanwhile, the government has confirmed it is considering legislation to remove Andrew from the royal line of succession - he is currently eighth in line for the throne. Defence Minister Luke Pollard said the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Pollard told the BBC that the government had been working with Buckingham Palace on the plans, and hopes it will gain cross party support.The action would require an act of Parliament, which would have to be approved by MPs and peers and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.It would also need to be supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where the King is head of state.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Following the latest revelations, historian David Olusoga told BBC Newsnight there is now \"a desperate desire within government and within the palace to draw a firewall… between this crisis and the wider monarchy\".On Saturday, several unmarked police cars were again seen Andrew's former Windsor mansion Royal Lodge, where he lived for many years.Thames Valley Police is expected to continue searching the 30-room property, until Monday, the BBC understands.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesDomenico had been on life support for almost two months at Naples's Monaldi HospitalA toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a \"sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition\".The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.Petruzzi has said the organ arrived \"burned by frostbite\" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.\"It's over. Domenico is gone,\" Mercolino told reporters on Saturday.She said a foundation would be established in his name.The family's lawyer said the foundation would be for \"all children who cannot have a transplant and to help all victims of malpractice and medical negligence\".Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the \"whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten\".She wrote on X: \"On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.\"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident.\"On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was \"not compatible\" with another transplant.Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: \"If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun.\"Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that \"we must absolutely clarify what happened\".\"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

When Harry asked a staff member to cancel the transaction, she stepped in to pay for the £44 shop.Harry's wife Emma, 37, said it \"restored their faith in humanity - she didn't have to do that, but she did. Her kindness meant I could feed my daughter, make sure she was warm.\"Emma BrownFreya-Maureen Brown was born on SundayEmma and Harry, who had wanted a baby for 11 years, welcomed their daughter Freya-Maureen on 8 February after more than 24 hours of labour.Freya had been born smaller than expected and was not able to breastfeed without a manual aid. When the couple returned home with their new daughter the following day, Emma said they did not have everything they needed.\"She was smaller than expected so she had no blankets either - we were literally covering her up with one of the old Christmas blankets,\" she told BBC Radio Manchester.And so when Harry arrived at the checkout to find his payment card was not working, he did not know where to turn.\"It was one of those days - I was absolutely shattered by then after working all day on the Friday, getting into bed and then Emma going into labour,\" he said.\"By this point I hadn't slept - I'd had three hours sleep over the last three days.\"When I got to the till it just kept saying 'declined, declined, declined' \"I knew it was the right PIN and I double checked. \"And then I was calling and calling Emma but of course she'd just had a C-section and she could have been on the toilet, changing Freya - I just didn't know.\"Harry said he then called over a member of staff to say he would have to cancel the transaction.To his surprise, the Asda employee offered to pay for the full shop.\"It was so unexpected,\" Harry said. \"Even when I walked out the store, I was still a bit taken aback by it.\"'Made such a difference'For Emma, who was at home caring for Freya, the gesture meant far more than a one-off selfless deed.\"You hear about it all the time - people stepping in and doing this kind of thing - but that's never happened to us like this before,\" she said.\"You never expect it - you put yourself out there with your manners and let people go first and that kind of thing - but you never expect in the world that somebody would actually do that for you.\"She didn't have to do it at all, but it made such a difference to us.\"And it's nice to see that people out there are still decent - especially in this current climate where people are struggling to pay the bills and things like that.\"It's just nice to be surprised by the world once in a while.\"The couple have said they had since been able to reach out to the staff member to share their gratitude and pay back the £44.\"We have given her the monetary value back and nominated her for an award within the company - and she definitely didn't want the money back, she was just doing it to be nice,\" the couple said.Related stories",

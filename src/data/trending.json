The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaSir Chris Wormald was appointed as cabinet secretary just over a year agoSir Chris Wormald has been forced out as the head of the Civil Service and cabinet secretary.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who only appointed Sir Chris to the role in December 2024, said he was grateful \"for the support he has given me over the past year\".The Cabinet Office said the move was \"by mutual agreement\" but it follows months of negative media reports suggesting Downing Street was unhappy with his performance.His responsibilities will be shared by Catherine Little, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, Dame Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the Home Office and James Bowler, permanent secretary at the Treasury, until a replacement is appointed \"shortly\".It makes Sir Chris the shortest-serving cabinet secretary in the history of the post.At the time of his appointment, the PM said Sir Chris would be tasked with \"the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\".However, as a career civil servant some questioned whether he was the best person to reform the Civil Service.Sir Chris also had ultimate responsibility for the due diligence checks carried out before Lord Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, although he took up the role only a few days before the appointment was formally announced.He is the third senior official to leave the government operation in a matter of days, following Sir Keir's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and his director of communications Tim Allan, as the PM seeks to reset his team after the Mandelson scandal.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Sir Chris was \"the latest person Keir Starmer has thrown under the bus to save his own skin\".Dave Penman, head of the FDA Union, which represents senior civil servants, said the treatment of Sir Chris was \"a new low for this government and its relationship with the Civil Service\", following \"days of open speculation\".\"Wormald had barely started in the cabinet secretary role before the anonymous briefings started to scapegoat him and undermine his authority,\" he added.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey posted on X: \"Very worried about who Keir Starmer will blame when there is literally no one else left in Number 10.\"In a statement, Sir Keir said: \"I am very grateful to Sir Chris for his long and distinguished career of public service, spanning more than 35 years, and for the support that he has given me over the past year. \"I have agreed with him that he will step down as cabinet secretary today.\"Sir Chris said: \"It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as a civil servant for the past 35 years, and a particular distinction to lead the service as cabinet secretary. \"I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the extraordinary civil servants, public servants, ministers, and advisers I have worked with.\"Getty ImagesDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles at the Department for International Trade, the Ministry of Justice and the Home OfficeThe government's favoured successor is Dame Antonia, who was on the four-person shortlist for the role when Sir Chris was appointed.If given the job, she would be the first female head of the Civil Service.However, on Wednesday evening Lord McDonald, the former head of the Foreign Office, told Channel 4 News that if this was the case then \"in my view, the due diligence has some way still to go\".He called for a \"full process\" to appoint a new cabinet secretary that \"starts from scratch\".This has been interpreted as a reference to an investigation Dame Antonia faced over allegations about her spending in 2017 when she was the government's consul-general in New York, and Lord McDonald was her boss.In response to Lord McDonald's interview, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"There is absolutely no basis for this criticism.⁠\"Antonia Romeo is a highly respected permanent secretary with a 25-year record of excellent public service.\"The allegations all come from a single grievance made some time ago by a former employee. All the allegations were dismissed on the basis there was no case to answer.\"The Cabinet Office said the appointment process would be agreed by the First Civil Service Commissioner, who is currently Baroness Stuart, former Labour MP and Brexit campaigner Gisela Stuart.Sir Keir has promised to tighten up vetting for senior roles, after the appointments of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador and Lord Doyle as a peer, despite their links to convicted sex offenders.As cabinet secretary, Sir Chris had been overseeing the government's release of documents demanded by Parliament about Lord Mandelson's appointment.Badenoch had called for Sir Chris to be kept in the role until this process was complete and for a \"full new process\" to select his replacement.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterJames Van Der Beek talks to BBC Radio 1 about Dawson's Creek coming to an end in 2003Full confession. Dawson's Creek was my guilty pleasure in the late 90s. Truthfully, I was probably a little too old to watch it in my early 20s, but my friends and I would often find ourselves under the duvet on the sofa on a Sunday morning after a big night out, nursing our hangovers with a cuppa and a side of American teen drama.We might have giggled at the unrealistically articulate monologues, but secretly wished we'd also had that pitch-perfect snappy riposte to dole out to a disappointing boyfriend (or two).The hit show was created by Kevin Williamson, who was also behind the Scream franchise and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and has previously described working on the Dawson's Creek as \"a charmed experience\".It followed a group of teenage friends living in the fictional small town of Capeside, Massachusetts, navigating the ups and downs of adolescence.And Dawson Leery - played by James Van Der Beek, who has died aged 48 - was always at the centre of the series, which ran from 1998 to 2003.The aspiring floppy-haired filmmaker could be sensitive but manipulative, loveable yet irritating. And Van Der Beek made the role his own.Getty Images\"The show was built around him,\" Emily Longeretta, director of features at Variety,  told BBC News.\"The creator Kevin Williamson has said many times... that Dawson was based on him [Williamson] and he had to find the right person to do that, and James immediately stepped into that role,\" she added.\"He took this character that was not a jock or the cool kid in high school and... made him loveable, someone that people fall in love with, that was not afraid to be emotional, something that a lot of men on TV, especially young men... it's frowned upon. \"James Van Der Beek was able to do that with such eloquence, his emotional connection and authenticity really came through the screen.\"The show made stars of its key cast, including Dawson's childhood friend and love interest Joey (Katie Holmes), his friend Pacey (Joshua Jackson), new girl in town Jen (Michelle Williams) and Audrey (Busy Philipps).While the series had a very respectable if not huge audience in the US for the time - averaging about six million viewers throughout its run - it was also broadcast in 50 countries, including the UK and Australia, where it enjoyed a cult following. A world away from the glamour of other teen shows such as Beverly Hills 90210, it tackled real-life issues such as loss, grief, sexuality, mental health and heartbreak but in an accessible and gentle way that connected with young viewers.TV critic Scott Bryan told the BBC: \"The show was a breakthrough because it was one of the first that talked to teens like adults. \"It was a show that very much had its heart on its sleeve, with the characters openly talking to each other about their feelings (and their feelings for each other). It didn't look down on its audience, and it featured performances that were more fleshed out than its rivals.\"Indeed, parental figures were very much on the periphery. Joey's mother had died and her father was in prison; Dawson's parents become preoccupied with their divorce; Jen lived with her grandmother and Pacey had a difficult relationship with his alcoholic father.Getty ImagesThe teens were almost precociously self-aware, which admittedly made us roll our eyes at some of the dialogue on occasion.But with few grown-ups available to model emotional literacy, the kids had no choice but to attempt it themselves.The main focus of all the handwringing was, of course, the love triangle between Dawson, Joey and Pacey.Dawson ugly-crying as he \"sets Joey free\" to be with Pacey is still a hugely popular meme. We may have groaned, but, as Anita Singh wrote in the Telegraph on Wednesday: \"It's a testament to Van Der Beek that he maintained the character's popularity and his role at the heart of the series. Nobody wanted this hero to get the girl, but they did want him to be happy.\"Getty ImagesA cast reunion and cancer benefit took place last year; Van Der Beek was too ill to attend but sent a video messageDawson's Creek was also groundbreaking. It featured one of the first gay kisses on primetime US TV - certainly the first between two teenagers - when Jack McPhee (Kerr Smith) and Ethan (Adam Kaufman) locked lips in series three.Television in the 1990s and early Noughties wasn't exactly famed for LGBT inclusion, so the moment when Pacey defended his friend Jack after he was asked by a teacher to read aloud a personal poem he had written about coming out, felt seismic.\"I had taken that whole journey, and I wanted a character on the show to represent that journey and to represent that side of me.\"\"But I'm having a great time,\" he reflected. \"This is what I wanted to do.\"Additional reporting by Kate Moore.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterEPAThe BBC's total public service spending last year was more than £4bnThe BBC is making cuts amounting to about 10% of its costs in the face of \"substantial financial pressures\".The broadcaster said the savings needed to be made over the next three years.A spokesman declined to put a figure on the amount, but it is expected to be hundreds of millions of pounds. The BBC's total public service spending last year was more than £4bn.No details have yet been given about any programmes or services that will be affected.The new cuts come on top of about £150m that must still be found by March 2028 as part of an existing savings programme.A BBC spokesperson added: \"Over the last three years we have delivered more than a half a billion pounds worth of savings, much of which we've been able to reinvest into our output across the BBC.\"In a rapidly changing media market, we continue to face substantial financial pressures.\"As a result we expect to make further savings over the next three years of around 10% of our costs.\"This is about the BBC becoming more productive and prioritising our offer to audiences to ensure we're providing the best value for money, both now and in the future.\"The announcement comes as the BBC negotiates with the government about its future, and that of the licence fee, ahead of the renewal of its royal charter at the end of 2027.The corporation gets most of its income from the licence fee, but the number of TV licences sold has been declining in recent years.The BBC has said it accepts that the licence fee needs reform, but that any changes must \"safeguard the BBC as a universal public broadcaster\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of President Barack Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding would reduce automobile manufacturers' spending by $2,400 per vehicle, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"ReutersWhile the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"ReutersClimate change was linked to the conditions that lead to huge fires in Los Angeles in early 2025Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" said Meghan Greenfield.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

    "body": "40 minutes agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterReutersTesco intends to make its Clubcard available to under-18s this year, the supermarket said.Its loyalty scheme allows shoppers to get discounts on thousands of products, including its popular meal deals, and collect points which can be turned into vouchers.The supermarket did not say why it has decided to widen eligibility to younger customers, or elaborate on how this might work.It follows campaigning from Which? urging supermarkets to lift what it called \"unfair restrictions\" on who can access loyalty schemes.The UK's competition regulator has said that, while supermarkets' eligibility requirements are unlikely to breach consumer law, some could do more to broaden access, including allowing under-18s to benefit from schemes. Loyalty cards are a way for retailers to collect data on what customers are buying and offer them more at lower prices. It allows them to compete for customers as rising food prices squeeze margins.The average person has loyalty cards for three supermarkets, data from research firm Kantar suggests.Most of the biggest UK supermarkets require shoppers to be 18 or over to sign up for their rewards schemes. Some, such as Morrisons, allow younger customers to log into their parent or guardian's account to access discounted prices.The Co-op says those aged 16 and over can sign up for its loyalty scheme, while younger customers can become a junior member if their parent or guardian purchases and registers a temporary card for them. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"We are actively reviewing Tesco Clubcard with the intention of making Clubcard available to under-18s this year.\"Those customers who do not have a Clubcard can still get great value from Tesco due to our combination of Aldi Price Match and Everyday Low Prices.\"Which? said millions of customers are excluded from getting discounts at big retailers because of age, address and digital access requirements.The consumer outlet, which has just released its annual customer satisfaction survey, said Tesco had twice missed out on being awarded \"Recommended Provider\" status because its Clubcard discounts were not available to everyone.Reena Sewraz, Which? retail editor, said Tesco's Clubcard savings can be \"really significant, which is why access to them matters so much for shoppers trying to make ends meet\".She added: 'We're glad Tesco has listened – this is a big step in the right direction, provided it moves quickly to fully implement these changes.\"Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of the Grocer, told the BBC he expects other supermarkets to take similar steps.\"When Tesco moves others follow. It's not the first loyalty card to become available to younger people but it's the biggest, and if it's okay by Tesco others will find a way,\" he said. Asked why most big UK supermarkets don't already allow under-18s to sign up to these schemes, he said there had been concerns about data protection for minors.But he added that if people younger than this can hold bank accounts, access social media and the internet, drive a car and get married, \"they should also be able to buy food for themselves and those they may care for, at the most competitive prices\".

    "body": "4 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesNHS staff in England and Wales are to get a 3.3% pay rise in the next financial year, the government has announced.The award covers around 1.5 million health staff, from nurses and midwives to physios and porters – the entire workforce apart from doctors, dentists and senior managers.The rise is more than the Department of Health and Social Care had initially put forward to the independent pay review body, but it said it had accepted the recommendation of 3.3% to demonstrate its commitment to NHS staff. The Welsh government has done the same.But a number of health unions said they were disappointed with the award.Royal College of Nursing (RCN) general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger, said it was below the current level of consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 3.4%, which measures how prices have risen in the past year.\"A pay award below the current level of inflation is an insult. Unless inflation falls, the government is forcing a very real pay cut on its NHS workers.\"This knife-edge game-playing is no way to treat people who prop up a system in crisis.\"She said she would wait to see what the rest of the public sector and doctors received before deciding what to do.Last year the RCN reacted angrily after resident doctors in England got 5.4% compared to nurses 3.6%, calling it grotesque.\"Nursing staff will not tolerate the disrespect of other years, when we were bottom of the pile,\" added Ranger.AngryHelga Pile, head of health at Unison, the biggest health union, said: \"Hard-pressed NHS staff will be downright angry at another below-inflation pay award.\"Yet again, they're expected to keep delivering more while effectively being given less, as pay slides behind living costs.\"The pay review body recommendation of a 3.3% rise also applies to Northern Ireland, but there has been no decision made yet on what will happen there although ministers have indicated they want to give the pay rise if the budget allows.The government in England said it did represent an above-inflation award, saying the forecast for the coming year was around 2%.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"This government hugely appreciates the incredible work of talented staff across our NHS.\"The government said it would be in pay packets by the start of April.But it gave no indication when the announcement about doctors pay would be made – it is thought the pay body that makes recommendations about pay for them has yet to deliver its report to ministers.The government is currently in talks with the British Medical Association about the pay of resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors.BMA members recently voted in favour of strike action, giving them another six-month mandate for walkouts. There have already been 14 strikes so far in the long-running dispute.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlicia CurryNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer has previously said he denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperateFormer Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with \"gross corruption\" over his ties with the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, police have said.The charge was brought after the Council of Europe lifted Jagland's immunity, which he enjoyed because of his past diplomatic role. He denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperate, his lawyer says.Emails released by the US government are thought to show that Jagland planned solo and family visits to Epstein's homes in Paris, New York and Palm Beach after the billionaire was convicted of a child sex offence.Three of Jagland's properties were searched by Norwegian crime unit Økokrim and he is now expected to be questioned.As well as serving as prime minister from 1996 to 1997, Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent a decade as secretary general of the Council of Europe.Jagland had diplomatic immunity from heading the Council, Europe's watchdog for democracy and human rights, for alleged acts carried out during his 2009 to 2019 tenure.The so-called Epstein files appear to show instances where the late financier covered the travel expenses to his properties for Jagland and his family.The former leader had planned a family trip to Epstein's private Caribbean island in 2014, but it was ultimately cancelled after Epstein fell ill. Jagland also faces allegations that he solicited Epstein's help in obtaining a bank loan in another exchange, although it is not clear whether this materialised, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Police have not confirmed whether this allegation is part of the gross corruption charge.Mention in the Epstein files - which have been released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) - does not indicate any wrongdoing. Jagland was seen walking out of his home alongside his lawyer in Oslo on Thursday, one of the properties - alongside two in Risør and Rauland - that Økokrim confirmed it had searched. Politicians, celebrities and royals have been caught up in the turmoil after the US DOJ published the latest tranche of files last month, containing millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The Nordic country has seen several public figures drawn into the widening scandal, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, diplomats Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.Juul's lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende - who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity. He added that he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.",

    "body": "40 minutes agoBranwen Jeffreys,Education EditorandNathan StandleyGetty ImagesParents should be involved in the \"vast majority\" of cases where a child questions their gender, according to new government guidance for all English schools.The legally-binding advice says schools should not initiate steps towards social transitioning - when pupils change their name, pronoun or clothes to reflect their gender identity - and should instead consider carefully what other support a child might need.In primary schools in particular, full social transitioning should only happen \"very rarely\", it says.The guidance has been backed by the author of the landmark Cass Review, Dr Hilary Cass, who said the guidance was \"a huge step in the right direction\".Her review of gender care services for under-18s, published in 2024, was commissioned by NHS England after it saw a sharp rise in referrals for patients questioning their gender.Her report said the evidence around medical interventions in gender care was \"remarkably weak\", and there was a lack of research available.The guidance also says there are \"no exceptions\" for single-sex facilities at schools and colleges, including toilets and changing rooms, with single-sex sports also protected.But schools have been given some flexibility over how they deal with issues such as children's names and uniforms.The BBC understands single-sex schools will continue to follow the current admissions code, which allows them to admit pupils only on the basis of their biological sex.Cass said the guidance was \"practical and reflects the recommendations of my review, giving schools much-needed clarity on their legal duties so they can support children with confidence\".Overall, the new guidance also makes a clear distinction between a child's wishes, and what might be in their best interests.There is a reminder that while some children explore different gender identities, most do not go on as adults to fully transition to a different gender from their biological sex.\"What comes across quite strongly in the guidance is that proceeding with a social transition is going to be very much the exception, rather than the rule,\" Cass told the BBC.She emphasised the importance of involving parents wherever possible, saying \"children don't thrive well when there are secrets between them and their parents\".\"Too many times during my review I heard about schools having socially transitioned young people without involving parents, and parents were in possession of all sorts of knowledge about what's going on that the school just wouldn't know about,\" she said.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the new guidance would deliver \"pragmatic support for teachers, reassurance for parents, and above all, the safety and wellbeing of children and young people\".Maya Forstater, CEO of Sex Matters, welcomed the news of the guidance, but criticised its content around social transition.\"Schools are still being left with the idea that they can facilitate 'social transition' – which remains undefined – and that they should negotiate this on a case-by-case basis,\" she said.\"They are being encouraged to think that children have a 'birth sex' as well as some other concept of sex. This has no basis in law or reality, and undermines safeguarding.\"A spokesperson for the charity Stonewall said it would be reviewing the guidance carefully, and the final statutory guidance should listen to and reflect the experiences of young people who are questioning their gender.\"Many in the LGBTQ+ community, especially trans people, are increasingly feeling their voices are not heard,\" they added.The new advice around children questioning their gender has been included in an update to existing statutory guidance for schools on how to keep children safe.It was first promised in 2018 in England.The long delay has left head teachers navigating one of the most contested social issues on their own.Some have paid for legal advice, while others have taken mitigating steps such as introducing gender-neutral toilets.Thursday's update has been roundly welcomed by head teachers' unions.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools had done a \"very good job\" dealing with the issue during an \"often-polarised public debate\" in recent years.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the guidance would address the need for \"greater clarity about how schools should manage this sensitive issue and support their pupils\".In December 2023, the previous Conservative government had published draft guidance for consultation, which took a harder stance on some issues, including banning the use of alternate pronouns in primary school.But that consultation was overtaken by the calling of a general election in May 2024, which ultimately led to a change of government.A new consultation on Thursday's updated guidance is due to run for 10 weeks.In Scotland, ministers said facilities must be available on the basis of biological sex, but schools could also provide gender-neutral toilets.Education Minister Paul Givan had said he had asked officials to consider the implications of the Supreme Court decision and to seek legal advice.In Wales, schools were told in 2023 to expect guidance on supporting transgender pupils the next academic year. An update to the Welsh government's LGBTQ+ action plan, published in January, says officials are working to ensure guidance is ready for a new government following May's Senedd election. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoElla KiplingandHafsa KhalilPA MediaThe billionaire Manchester United co-owner said the UK was \"colonised\" by immigrants Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for \"offending some people\" with his language after saying the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\", but maintained an \"open debate\" on the matter was needed.The billionaire co-owner of Manchester United had faced criticism from Sir Keir Starmer, who described his comments on Wednesday as \"offensive and wrong\".On Thursday, Sir Jim said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.\"The club has not directly addressed the remarks, but said it \"prides itself\" on being \"inclusive\". \"Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home,\" the club said in a statement on Thursday.\"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.\"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"Sources told BBC Sport that the FA is examining whether Sir Jim's comments brought the game into disrepute.Should the FA formally investigate Sir Jim's comments and choose to charge the 73-year-old under its own rules, he could face further punishment.His earlier comments to Sky News had drawn criticism from Manchester United fan groups. He said: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\"He incorrectly claimed the population of the UK had risen by 12 million to 70 million people in the last five years. The Office for National Statistics estimates it has actually risen from 66.7 million to 69.4 million, an increase of less than three million.A Downing Street spokesperson said it was \"absolutely right\" that Sir Jim had apologised for his language. Following the billionaire's comments to the broadcaster, the prime minister's spokesman said Sir Keir thought they were \"offensive and wrong\" and it is \"absolutely right\" he apologised. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said \"a lot of people find that language offensive\".He added the government has \"done a lot to bear down\" on small boats and there is \"lots we need to do on irregular migration\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage previously pushed back against Sir Keir, saying: \"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.\"Following the apology, he told BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast the comments were \"accurate and right\", if you \"take the word colonise out\".\"And what Jim is saying is that mass migration has done us harm and made us poorer. And I think he's absolutely right,\" Farage said. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Sir Jim's comments \"go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood\".\"Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region.\"Criticism of Sir Jim's remarks also came in from football groups.Anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out called them \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\", while anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said it was \"deeply concerned\".\"Language of this kind echoes narratives that have historically been used to stigmatise migrant communities, fuel division, and legitimise hostility towards minority groups,\" it said in a statement. \"Football clubs and their leadership hold enormous cultural influence.\"Ratcliffe, one of Britain's richest individuals, founded one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos.In 2020, he reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco, which does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.He campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 European Union referendum.Ahead of the 2024 general election, he told Bloomberg he had \"had enough\" of the Tories, putting his support instead behind Labour.",

    "body": "Minnesota immigration enforcement surge is ending, Trump border tsar says39 minutes agoBrandon DrenonUS border tsar: Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge endingThe US immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota will end, President Donald Trump's border tsar told reporters on Thursday.Tom Homan said Trump had approved his request to conclude the operation, adding he would stay in Minnesota \"a little longer to oversee the drawdown, to ensure its success\". Homan said Operation Metro Surge had resulted in many illegal immigrants who had committed violent crimes being detained for deportation. But the surge also sparked nationwide protests when two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration officers.After the news conference, top Minnesota and federal officials appeared at a Capitol Hill hearing on Trump's immigration crackdown.Officials in Minnesota have been able to \"greatly reduce the number of targets\" for immigration enforcement, Homan said, adding that Operation Metro Surge was a \"great success\".More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual misconduct. Homan said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has always had a presence in Minnesota and will continue to have one. He said that the surge's end came after an unprecedented level of cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement, with local officials increasing their crackdown on protesters he called public safety threats and local jails more willing to notify ICE of the release dates for individuals it was seeking.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said at a news conference following Homan's announcement that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the drawdown of federal agents. \"The fact of the matter is they left us with deep damage, generational trauma,\" Walz said. \"They left us with economic ruin in some cases. They left us with many unanswered questions.\"The governor is expected to soon propose a $10m (£7m) emergency fund for small businesses who say they were financially hurt by the surge.Following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti last month, President Donald Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis to oversee the surge, sidelining the operation's leader, Greg Bovino, who had faced intense criticism for ICE's use of force and what many in the city alleged were civil rights violations.Trump's immigration crackdown has faced resistance in Democrat-led cities like Minneapolis from activists in the streets and local officials and immigrants in the courts. The administration last month finished removing National Guard troops from Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago - places where there had been large protests against the presence of troops and immigration agents - according to US Northern Command.Some Republicans, too, had questioned the Minneapolis operation.Senator Rand Paul told a committee hearing with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Thursday that \"saying we're going to reduce this presence in the street is a good sign and a good step forward\".\"I'm glad that's happening,\" the Republican from Kentucky said. \"I think that is de-escalation.\"ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said at the hearing that the agency is tracking roughly 1.6 million undocumented immigrants with deportation orders in the US, including roughly 800,000 who have criminal convictions.He also defended against accusations from lawmakers that the agency was not holding officers accountable, saying ICE had launched 37 open investigations for excessive use of force since January 2025.The fight over how immigration agents operate has now put the federal government at risk of a partial shutdown as Congress debates a funding measure for the DHS, which includes ICE. On Thursday, the US Senate failed to advance a bill on new funding for the department. Earlier this month, lawmakers approved DHS funding for two weeks and had planned to use that time to negotiate a substantive deal. But with no agreement in sight and the upper chamber set to go on break, DHS could lose its funding starting Saturday. That will affect a variety of services, including transportation security at US airports and responses to disasters and large-scale emergencies. Last year, lawmakers passed legislation creating a separate pool of funding that should allow ICE to continue to operate.Democrats are demanding changes in ICE - such as ending the wearing of masks - in exchange for support for the bill. They are also pushing for immigration agents in Minnesota and elsewhere to be required to reveal their identities and to end warrant-less searches.",

In the Barcelona area, four workers were injured as they cleared fallen trees and a pedestrian was hurt when a wall collapsed. Dozens of flights were cancelled at the city's El Prat airport.ED JONES/AFPA lorry lies on its side during strong winds brought by Storm Nils near Leucate in south-west FranceMeanwhile, a woman had to be rescued when her car fell into a sinkhole that emerged on a road near the western town of Cáceres.Across the border in central Portugal, a 10m section of the A1 motorway collapsed after the Mondego river burst its banks, and the flooded river breached the Casais do Campo dyke.The stretch of motorway had already been closed before it collapsed.EPA/ShutterstockThe main A1 motorway near Coimbria is expected to be closed for weeks because of the collapseVisiting the scene on Thursday, Infrastructure Minister Miguel Pinto Luz said it would take weeks for the road to be repaired.This week alone, the government says Portugal has experienced 20% of its annual average rainfall, but the poor weather has been going on for weeks, battering the country's infrastructure.\"Since the start of January, discharges from dams and reservoirs have been the equivalent of about a year of our country's water consumption,\" Maria Graça Carvalho told Portuguese media.Authorities are also closely watching the River Tagus, where they say the flow of water from three dams was 6,500 cubic metres per second Thursday morning. Interior Minister Maria Lucia Amaral resigned earlier this week following political criticism of her handling of the worsening conditions, which have left several people dead and caused billions of euros in damage.Even before the latest storm, Portugal had endured Storm Kristin, Leonardo and Storm Marta. Meanwhile, in France, red alerts were declared in several areas in the south-west, south and south-east.In the southern Aude region 40 roads were declared impassable with gales of up to 110km/h.Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot paid tribute to the lorry driver killed in the Landes region and appealed to the public to \"exercise utmost caution when travelling and check with their transport operator before any journey\".Police told French media that a tree fell on the man's vehicle and a branch went through his windscreen.Elsewhere a worker was seriously hurt when a tree fell on his vehicle at Castelsarrasin north of Toulouse.",

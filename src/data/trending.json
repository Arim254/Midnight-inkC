    "body": "20 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentBBCAs ambulances queued in front of Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading last week, corridors full of patients were waiting for a bed on a ward. Emergency department consultant Omar Nafousi was at his wit's end.\"We've no space,\" he told the BBC last week. \"This is not what I signed up for when I became a doctor.\"It is a scene that is being repeated in hospitals up and down the country as winter viruses and cold weather add to the pressures on the health service. Currently nearly 4,000 beds in England alone are taken up by patients with flu, Covid and the vomiting bug norovirus, according to NHS England, and the situation is on a similar scale in the rest of the UK.But that is dwarfed by another pressure – the patients who should not be in hospital.In Pictures via Getty ImagesOmar Nafousi, an emergency department consultant told the BBC last week, 'We've no space... This is not what I signed up for when I became a doctor'Every day there are more than 13,000 people whose treatment has been completed who are still in hospitals in England, the latest figures from NHS England suggest. Plus there are a further 4,000 around the rest of the UK - which means around one in eight beds are occupied by people who don't necessarily need to be there.Many of these \"delayed discharge\" patients are older and may be frail and living with multiple health conditions who need support in the community.But it comes at a huge cost. The average hospital bed takes £562 a day to staff and maintain, according to NHS England, meaning the health service in England is losing more than £225m a month supporting patients who could be elsewhere.Then there is the cost to other patients. \"We are seeing surgery cancelled and long waits in A&E because there are no beds available on the wards,\" says Clifford Kilgore, a senior nurse working with older people, who serves on the Nurses and Allied Health Professionals' Council of the British Geriatrics Society.As for the staff there is a toll on morale, too - among doctors, nurses and ambulance workers. \"It's terrible when you see patients go downhill in hospital when you know they would be better off somewhere else,\" says Laura Hichens, a nurse who leads the \"discharge liaison\" team at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead.The issue of delayed discharges is far from new. For years, it has been talked about, if not agonised over, and the NHS started tracking the delays in the early 2010s. Last summer, the government launched an urgent and emergency care plan, which pledged to reduce the delays, with the promise there would be improvements.If it could be solved, the impact on the NHS would be transformative, experts have told me. Yet the problem throws up many deeper questions about the care system, coordination and planning in hospitals - with some doctors even asking whether the NHS is over-treating patients, particularly those at the end of life.'The system's running faster just to stand still'On paper, it all sounds straightforward: simply send all those patients who are well home. But it's not that easy.\"It takes a lot of time and effort to discharge a patient,\" says Emma Dodsworth, a researcher who has studied the issue for Nuffield Trust think tank. \"Some may need adaptations to their home, some short-term help with washing and dressing or home visits from nurses. Some a combination of all three, while others may need a care home place to be found.\"And because the population is getting older and frailer, there are more complex cases ending up in hospital. The system is having to run faster just to stand still.\"Arranging the discharge of these patients relies on a close relationship between council-run social care services and the NHS.Getty ImagesAt Queen Elizabeth Hospital, social workers arrange help such as washing or dressing in people's own home, and physiotherapists and occupational therapists can help older people stay mobile and live independentlyThere are plenty of examples of this happening. At Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital social workers and nurses are working side-by-side in the discharge liaison hub, which has been fully up and running for two years. The hub also has a housing officer, employed by the council, to arrange home adaptations or temporary housing.Planning for discharge begins as soon as a patient is admitted to hospital. \"That means when they are ready to be discharged it can be done pretty much straight away for many,\" says Hichens.Figures show the hub consistently discharges patients more quickly than average.It's a template that some might suggest should be rolled out en masse across the country - but so far that hasn't happened.'Strained relations' with social careA recent report by the NHS Confederation and Association of Directors of Social Services (ADASS) warns that cooperation between the NHS and social care sectors is \"inconsistent\" across the country with relationships sometimes becoming \"frictional\".Kerrie Allward, who acts as a policy lead for ADASS and is executive director for adult social care and health at Walsall Council, is not surprised by these findings.Her area has adopted a similar approach to Gateshead and she says that led to a five-fold drop in delayed discharges in the year after it was introduced.But she argues that across the social care sector money remains a \"critical issue\" – with local government funding squeezed so much over the past decade or so that spending on social care has not been able to keep up.Local authorities are spending around £32bn a year on adult social care – that is £4.6bn higher in real terms than 2010-11 – but councils argue that increase has been swallowed up by higher costs, increasing demand and greater complexity of need.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesLocal authorities are spending around £32bn a year on adult social careAllward says some councils have tried to compensate by spending ever more on social care - which now accounts for more than half of their budgets across the board. But, she says, \"Councils often lack the funds to invest in integrated services that would support more timely discharge.\"And while she enjoys working with the NHS, in her experience not all social care directors feel the same - she says that some NHS leaders blame social care for delayed discharges.\"This blame can strain relationships, especially as data reveals that social care is usually responsible for only a minority of delays.\"The government said it was increasing investment further in the coming years, while seeking wider reform of the way services are funded.Examining the Danish approach Some other European countries have a different approach.Denmark, for example, has created a national network of \"intermediate care beds\" in community hospitals and care homes, staffed by nurses and carers, that patients can be discharged into.Denmark has also invested in community nursing services to support patients in the community and in their homes rather than in hospital. \"We could learn from places like Denmark where there is much greater integration between health and social care,\" says Dodsworth.Getty ImagesAllward says some other European countries, such as Denmark, have a much more coordinated approach to health and social careSome NHS trusts have bought places in care homes to allow them to discharge patients. University Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust has taken this one step further: it has spent £10m buying and renovating a former care home in the city called Preston Lodge, which opened in July and has more than 50 beds.Staffed by nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and with its own GP, it allows patients who are medically fit to leave hospital continue to receive support. Preston Lodge says these patients would have spent an extra 10 days in hospital on average.Inside Preston Lodge, patients eat meals together and some of them socialise, too - doing jigsaw puzzles and watching TV together.\"Hospitals are great places when you are acutely ill, but they are not when you no longer need that medical care,\" says the trust's head of nursing Emma Roberts. Dodsworth says these \"step-down\" facilities can help patients get back on to their feet while not taking up a hospital bed.However, she says the lack of integration between social care and the NHS remains an obstacle to this approach being used more widely.The question of family responsibilityImproving coordination between the NHS and councils is only part of the solution, however. NHS England monthly data shows that around only a third of delays are down to lack of community care or a care home place.Another challenge is the attitude of some families who prefer - and feel safer, perhaps - if their loved one is under the care of a hospital.Hichens says she spends much of her time persuading the family members of patients that they would be happier elsewhere - and healthier too.\"They think hospital is the best place for their relative,\" she says. \"But we know the longer you spend in hospital the more patients are at risk of getting frailer, losing strength and needing more care.\"\"Hospitals are great places when you are acutely ill, but they are not when you no longer need that medical care,\" says Emma Roberts, a head of nursing at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS TrustSome families are not prepared to take on caring responsibilities either, says Dr Vicky Price, an acute medical consultant who diagnoses and treats patients brought in as emergency admissions.\"In some countries, the culture is different – they don't need care homes because families step in.\"But she concedes it can be difficult for some families, including financial pressures that make caring for a relative a challenge. \"There are justifiable reasons why they can't take on that responsibility.\"Time to rethink end-of-life care?In Price's view, her own profession bears some responsibility, too. She says about a third of people who are admitted for medical reasons are in their last year of life.\"We admit them and end up over-treating them with interventions, scans and pills,\" argues Price, who is president of the Society for Acute Medicine.One patient she saw recently was in his late 80s and had 14 appointments booked for the next two months for health problems including cardiac and renal issues, and liver and eye problems.\"I talked to him – the only one he really wanted to keep was the eye one,\" she says. \"We cancelled the rest.\"The problem when you start trying to treat everything is that you prescribe more pills, those pills have side-effects and you can actually end up making a person's health worse.\" Heritage Images via Getty ImagesThis ward at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, pictured in the early Twentieth Century, had rugs, pictured on the walls and other home comfortsDoctors often lack the confidence as well as the time to have these difficult discussions with families, Price says.But changing that approach would also raise numerous ethical questions.She says for many of these patients, palliative care and managing their symptoms, mainly pain, would be preferable: \"Their quality of life would be much better and we would avoid a hospital admission.\"But in practice there are obstacles to this.And the Association of Palliative Medicine has long argued there is insufficient investment in end-of-life care, which means people struggle to get support. Marie Curie suggest nearly a quarter of people who need palliative care do not get it.More from InDepthClifford Kilgore agrees reducing admissions is a key part of the solution. \"Hospitals are good for treating an acute illness, but the problem is that if you admit an older person with pneumonia they can spend a week in a hospital bed not moving and they become immobile and unable to look after themselves,\" he says.\"It is a vicious cycle. For some patients, being in hospital actually causes harm.\"He helps to run a \"hospital-at-home\" service, which provides specialist hospital-level care to patients with frailty and conditions such as heart failure and respiratory illness.Services of this kind care for around 12,000 people around the country, but again they are not available everywhere. Providing more expert care like this outside of hospital is a priority for the NHS under the government's 10-year plan.Kilgore says it cannot come soon enough: \"Get this right and it would have an immediate impact.\" But not soon enough for those patients in Reading queuing for a bed.Top picture credit: LightRocket via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoKate Whannel,Political reporter andJonathan Beale,Defence correspondentHead of the Armed Forces Sir Richard Knighton has said the UK is \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\", as he avoided questions about a reported shortfall in the government's defence spending plans.Last week, The Times and The Sun reported that the Ministry of Defence believes it will need an additional £28bn to meet its costs over the next four years, prompting a rewrite of the government's defence investment plan.The plan was due in the autumn of last year but has been delayed.Speaking to the parliamentary Defence Committee, Sir Richard said he could not provide a date for publication but added that the department was \"working flat out\" on it.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the re-election of US President Donald Trump, the UK, along with other Nato countries, has come under pressure to boost its defence spending.Last year, Labour pledged to increase overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, costing an additional £6bn a year. It has also said spending will rise to 3.5% by 2035.The defence investment plan will set out how new equipment and infrastructure will be paid for and which areas will be prioritised.According to reports, Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Richard delivered the forecast warning of a £28bn shortfall in spending plans to the prime minister and chancellor ahead of Christmas.Appearing before the committee on Monday, Sir Richard confirmed he had met Sir Keir Starmer in December and that they had talked about the defence investment plan but added that material discussed was \"classified secret\".\"I'm not going to talk about that in public,\" he said. He added that despite an \"unprecedented\" increase in spending it was \"a statement of the obvious that we can't do everything we want to do as quickly as we want to do it within the context of the budget set\". \"That requires ministers to make difficult trade-offs.\"The Ministry of Defence has long-struggled to balance its books. The department's analysis in 2023 found that its equipment plan was expected to exceed its budget by £16.9bn and in 2024, the Public Accounts Committee said the UK was facing a £29bn deficit in its spending plans. During the evidence session, Sir Richard was also asked about the UK's readiness to send troops to Ukraine as part of a European reassurance forces, in the event that a peace deal is agreed. He did not provide numbers on how many soldiers the UK would send but said he was confident the Army could fulfil its commitment \"in the short term\".Asked about the UK's domestic preparedness and national resilience in the event of a conflict, Sir Richard said the UK was not doing \"as well as I would want us\". He said there needed to be more work on ensuring infrastructure such as railways and flood defences could be protected against sabotage.Sir Richard was also pressed on whether the UK would have the capacity to treat increased numbers of wounded soldiers in the event of a conflict.He said work on the issue was ongoing but added: \"We don't have a holistic plan for how we would mobilise the NHS in times of all out war in Europe.\"",

And, very briefly, he was chancellor and then the most senior minister at the Cabinet Office, the engine room of Whitehall.Nigel Farage has believed for some months that if Reform are to be ready for power, they need to have senior figures with experience of how government works. Zahawi ticks a few boxes in that sense.The former MP also has a compelling back story. He was born in Iraq, but fled with his family when he was a boy. When he arrived in the UK, he didn't speak English. But since then, he has had a successful career in business, including co-founding the polling firm YouGov. His is the story of an immigrant who has risen to be a senior figure in the business world and government.Zahawi joins a growing list of senior Conservatives who have defected to Reform. The BBC's latest tally shows 22 ex-MPs who have now made that leap. Among them are a number of former cabinet and junior ministers. Many of them were among the most vocal supporters of Boris Johnson: Nadine Dorries, Andrea Jenkyns, Jonathan Gullis, Lia Nici, now Zahawi. The list goes on.For a party seeking to replace the Conservatives as the main force on the right of British politics, the attraction of regular defections is clear. Here are people who have been at the very top of the Conservative Party, who no longer think it is fit for purpose. They have all concluded there is a need for something new – and have made the jump to Reform.But this is also where the risks come in.Reform have been highly critical of the Conservatives in power – not least Boris Johnson's record on issues like immigration. Many Reform members despise what the Conservative Party did in power and plenty are sceptical about the idea of sharing a party with former cabinet ministers.You can expect attacks from Reform's political opponents: that the party is increasingly a collection of failed Conservative MPs. The Tories themselves have claimed Reform is becoming a party of \"has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\".It's a risk Nigel Farage has acknowledged. He claims he has turned down other Conservatives who wanted to join his party, but whom he didn't think were suitable. But the question Farage faces is how many former Tory MPs is too many? Some think he may have already reached the limit.Then there's another risk: Zahawi himself.Tonight, the Conservatives have claimed he was lobbying them just a few weeks ago to be made a member of the House of Lords. A source close to Mr Zahawi has denied he \"begged\" for a peerage – but the Conservatives are accusing their former MP of only making the jump because they wouldn't give him what he wanted.There's also Zahawi's personal tax affairs. He was given the boot by Rishi Sunak after a highly critical report from the prime minister's ethics adviser who said he failed to disclose that HMRC were investigating his tax affairs.This wasn't a small issue – the report found a serious breach of the ministerial code. It was judged that Zahawi had missed multiple chances to be open about his tax affairs. Zahawi called his mistakes careless, but it brought his ministerial career to an ignominious end.Nigel Farage has decided the baggage is worth it – and that the positives of Nadhim Zahawi's defection outweigh the negatives. There's no doubt this is another coup which has got Westminster talking – and wondering who might be next.But the drip drip of former Conservatives joining Reform is not without risk.",

It was very difficult.\"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed.\"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\"In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened.AFP via Getty ImagesCarolina and Rosita were photographed in Washington in July 2000 during a short trip thereOn Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had \"passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was.\"According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning.\"My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family,\" the president told the BBC.\"She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls.\"Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area – Chibuto – where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago.Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a \"wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. \"You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics.\"Despite recruiting more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment.Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.More about Mozambique from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'They just kept killing': Eyewitnesses describe deadly crackdown in Iran22 minutes agoRoja AssadiandSarah Namjoo,BBC PersianPublic domainA protester holds up a picture of crown prince Reza Pahlavi in Kaj Square, north-western Tehran on Friday\"I saw it with my own eyes - they fired directly into lines of protesters, and people fell where they stood.\" Omid's voice was shaking as he spoke, fearful of being traced. Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities.Omid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship.He said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles.\"We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands,\" he said. The BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week. Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government.One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution.The following day, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: \"The Islamic Republic will not back down.\" It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him.Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned \"terrorist actions\", state media reported.A young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like \"the day of judgement\".\"Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn't believe,\" she said. \"But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed. Seeing it with my own eyes made me so unwell that I completely lost morale. Friday was a bloody day.\"She said that, after Friday's killings, people were afraid to go out and that many were now chanting from alleys and inside their homes.Tehran was a battlefield, she said, with protesters and security forces taking positions and cover on the streets.But she added: \"In war, both sides have weapons. Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war.\"Mortuary videos shows violent government crackdown in IranEyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets.The forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said. \"Two or three people were killed in every alley,\" one witness alleged.Those who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates. International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18.Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands. The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters. However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as \"rioters\" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. Eyewitness imageFootage posted on Thursday showed large crowds in Babol, northern IranEyewitness imageImages posted on Thursday from Khorramabad in western Iran showed a man holding Iran's pre-revolutionary flagVideos verified by BBC Persian's fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests.Testimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network. Information from small towns - where many early casualties occurred -  is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited.But the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence.Nurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters.They reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies \"stacked on top of each other\" and not handed over to families.Eyewitness image / ReutersFootage from Tehran that emerged on Friday showed cars ablaze Graphic videos published on the activist-run Telegram channel Vahid Online on Sunday showed a large number of bodies at the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran, with many families either mourning or attempting to identify the corpses.In one of the videos apparently from Kahrizak, a photo of a body relatives are seen looking at the photos of unidentified bodies displayed on a screen.Many bodies in black bags were visible in the facility and on the street outside, only some of which seem to have been identified.One video showed the inside of a warehouse containing several bodies, while another showed a truck being unloaded with people removing corpses from it.A mortuary worker in a cemetery in Mashhad said that before sunrise on Friday morning between 180 and 200 bodies with severe head injuries were brought in and buried immediately.A source in Rasht told BBC Persian that 70 bodies of protesters were transferred to a hospital mortuary in the city on Thursday. According to the source, security forces demanded \"payment for bullets\" before releasing bodies to families.At the same time, a medical staff member at a hospital in eastern Tehran told BBC Persian that on Thursday, around 40 bodies were brought there the same day. The hospital's name has been withheld to protect the identity of the medic.UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday that he was \"shocked by reports of violence and excessive use of force by the Iranian authorities against protesters resulting in deaths and injuries in recent days\". \"I want to emphasise that regardless of the death toll, the use of lethal force by security forces is concerning,\" Mai Sato, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told BBC Persian.",

    "body": "Nadhim Zahawi defects to Reform UK after peerage bid ruled out by Tories3 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandNick Eardley,political correspondentNadhim Zahawi: \"Our wonderful country is sick\"Former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has become the latest senior Conservative to defect to Reform UK, as Tories claim the move came after he was rebuffed for a peerage.Zahawi, who is a former MP, said he felt the UK had reached a \"dark and dangerous\" moment, and the country needed \"a glorious revolution\", as he outlined why he was joining Nigel Farage's party.However, Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake said the move came after he made \"a number of approaches\" to party leader Kemi Badenoch, pressing his case to be nominated for the House of Lords, but was rejected.Farage unveiled Zahawi's defection at a press conference on Monday, one of around 20 former Tory MPs to join the party.Zahawi was chancellor for two months under Boris Johnson and served as a minister from 2018 to 2023, making him the most senior former Tory to join Reform so far. Speaking in a pre-recorded video before walking out on stage at the press conference, former minister Zahawi said Britain was \"broken\".He said: \"Nothing works, there is no growth, there is crime on our streets, and there is an avalanche of illegal migration that anywhere else in the world would be a national emergency.\"He added: \"I've made my mind up that the team that will deliver for this nation will be the team that Nigel will put together and that's why I've decided that I'm joining Reform.\"Answering questions from journalists, Zahawi said Badenoch had the \"baggage of a defunct brand\", before Farage said elections in Scotland, Wales and English councils this May would be the point where the Conservatives \"cease to be a national party\".But Hollinrake suggested Zahawi's thwarted \"personal ambition\" was linked to his decision to defect, telling the BBC he had been unsuccessfully pressing his case for a Conservative peerage with \"people very close to Kemi\".The party chair said conversations had taken place in recent weeks, adding: \"It seems strange to change his perspective only a few weeks down the road from those conversations taking place.\"He said: \"Our position was very clear, Kemi's position was very, very clear  - we want to make sure the people we elevate to the House of Lords are the right people, who make the right contribution and, indeed, have the right back story. \"We were very concerned Nadhim's past problems with his tax affairs, which led to his dismissal in the past from a role in the party.\"It was quite clear that we didn't feel Nadhim was the right person to be elevated to the House of Lords.\"A source close to Zahawi said: \"Nadhim did not beg for a peerage as they claim - Kemi called him for advice on how to save the party and he decided to join the only party he feels can save Britain.\"Earlier, a Conservative spokesman said Reform was \"fast becoming the party of has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\".PA MediaFarage insisted that this latest Tory defection did not mean Reform was becoming the Conservatives 2.0.He added there were \"plenty\" of current Conservative MPs asking about joining Reform and some were not being accepted, but he said Zahawi believed \"in what we're doing\" and also has the necessary \"conviction\".As well as his two months as chancellor at the end of Boris Johnson's time as prime minister, Zahawi was education secretary, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and chairman of the Conservative Party.He was sacked from that last position by Rishi Sunak in January 2023 after the prime minister's independent ethics adviser found that he had broken ministerial rules by failing to disclose that his tax affairs were under investigation by HMRC.Asked by the BBC about being sacked over his tax affairs, Zahawi said: \"The mistake I made was not to be specific about my declarations to the Cabinet Office.\"I absolutely think that politicians should be held to a higher level of accountability but I shouldn't be precluded from doing the right thing by my country.\"The Labour Party chair, MP Anna Turley, said Zahawi was \"a discredited and disgraced politician\" who had previously \"repeatedly lambasted his new boss over his divisive and extreme rhetoric\".\"This shameless scurry of yet another failed Tory over to Reform will tell people everything they need to know about both of them,\" she said.And the Liberal Democrat MP in his old constituency of Stratford-on-Avon, Manuela Perteghella, said: \"Reform is becoming a retirement home for disgraced former Conservative ministers.\"Zahawi was a candidate to succeed Johnson as prime minister in 2022 but only attracted the support of 25 of his colleagues and was eliminated in the first round of the leadership contest which Liz Truss won.He was education secretary from September 2021 to July 2022, and his short stint as chancellor of the exchequer came between July and September 2022.In November 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, he was appointed vaccines minister and oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme for nearly a year.Born in Iraq in 1967, he could have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War but instead he and his parents fled Iraq and he grew up in the UK.Questioned on whether he had concerns about allegations of racism made against his new party leader by more than 30 school peers, claims denied by Farage, Zahawi responded: \"If I thought the man sitting next to me had in any way a problem with people of my colour… I wouldn't be sitting next to him.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "3 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesFormer Fed chair and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is one of several economic policy leaders to rally behind Jerome PowellThree former heads of the US central bank on Monday strongly criticised a criminal investigation into chair Jerome Powell, describing it as a bid to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence.In a statement, Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, along with 10 other eminent former officials, rallied behind Powell.\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,\" the former officials wrote.\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" they added.The move by the Department of Justice (DoJ) comes after a year of relentless attacks on Powell by US President Donald Trump.As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has launched personal attacks, calling the Fed chair a \"major loser\" and \"numbskull\".The president said he did not \"know anything\" about the investigation. The Justice Department has been contacted for comment.The DoJ probe was first disclosed by Powell in an unscheduled video statement on Sunday.  He said the Justice Department had threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings.Powell called the investigation \"unprecedented\" and said he believed it stemmed from Trump's anger that the Fed had not brought interest rates down more quickly.\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" Powell said. \"Those are pretexts.\"The central bank lowered the target for its key lending rate three times in the second half of 2025, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years. But Trump has repeatedly said that the central bank has not cut interest rates as sharply as he would like.The DoJ probe \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\", Powell said in his statement.Monday's public condemnation of the DoJ move has been signed by former federal government officials appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents.When asked by Fox News on Monday about the Fed's independence, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt deferred to the Justice Department.\"Jerome Powell has proved he's no good at his job,\" Leavitt said. \"As to whether he's a criminal, that's an answer the Department of Justice is going to have to find.\"Watch: The unusual move Powell made in disclosing criminal investigationTrump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans.Last year, he spent months attacking Powell on social media and in remarks to reporters. He floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly abandon the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle.Yellen, who served as Fed chair for a year during Trump's first term before she was replaced by Powell, said in separate comments that the probe was \"extremely chilling\".\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" Yellen told CNBC.She suggested investors should be concerned about the development.\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic.\"Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chairman will end in May.But the Justice Department investigation and subsequent backlash could disrupt the confirmation process.North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was \"fully resolved\".Initial reaction in US stock markets was muted on Monday. The S&P 500 was roughly flat in early afternoon trading - a notable contrast to last year, when markets were jolted by perceived threats to the Fed's independence.Global markets also proved \"remarkably resilient\" on Monday, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. She noted that despite the overall calm, financial stocks did slump, as investors weighed the effects of a possible 10% cap on credit card interest rates.Still, analysts said the market reaction could grow if Trump succeeded in influencing Fed policy.Some Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about how the Justice Department probe might affect the Fed's work.Representative French Hill, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the investigation was causing an \"unnecessary distraction\" and it could \"undermine this and future administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions\".Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee, criticised Powell in a statement but added: \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest.\"",

    "body": "Landmark Rohingya genocide case against Myanmar heard at top UN court3 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongAFP via Getty ImagesMany Rohingya have fled Myanmar, ending up in neighbouring Bangladesh and in other Asian countriesMyanmar wanted to erase the Rohingya people through its use of \"genocidal policies\", The Gambia's foreign minister Dawda Jallow has told the UN's top court.The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is hearing a landmark case brought by the Muslim majority, West African nation in 2019, which accuses Myanmar of deliberately trying to destroy the minority Muslim population. Myanmar has previously denied the allegations.Jallow said The Gambia had reviewed \"credible reports of the most brutal and vicious violations imaginably inflicted upon a vulnerable group\".Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.Jallow told the court on Monday that the Rohingya \"had suffered decades of appalling persecution and years of dehumanising propaganda\", which was followed by the military crackdown and \"continual genocidal policies meant to erase their existence in Myanmar\". A damning report issued by the UN in 2018 said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas.Myanmar rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats.It will be given the opportunity to respond to The Gambia's allegations during the ICJ hearings, which are expected to last until the end of the month.The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media.A final decision is not expected for several months, if not years. While the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions.Jallow said that his country had bought the case against Myanmar out of a \"sense of responsibility\" following its own experience with a military government. \"Sadly, Myanmar appears to be trapped in the cycle of atrocities and impunities,\" Jallow said, referring to the military's overthrow of the civilian government in 2021.The country's former leader, Aung San Suu Kyi - who was deposed during the coup and jailed under charges widely condemned as politically motivated - saw her international reputation as a champion of human rights tarnished after she defended the army's actions following allegations of genocide against the Rohingya.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockMyanmar's former leader Aung San Suu Kyi was moved from jail to house arrest in 2023\"We don't just hope to get justice, we demand it and we would like to ask the court to take the actions against the Myanmar dictators, the leaders of the Myanmar military who committed the genocide,\" one survivor, Monaira, told the Reuters news agency outside the court in the Hague in the Netherlands. More than one million Rohingya still live in refugee camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region alone - some of the largest and most densely populated camps in the world, according to the UN's refugee agency. Others have made dangerous sea journeys to reach countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia. \"We don't want any more refugee life in Bangladesh because it's been a long time, and this is the time when the final hearing is going to happen,\" another survivor, Salma, said. The case is expected to set precedent in other genocide cases, including that bought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade and is being seen as an opportunity for the ICJ judges to refine the rules around the definition of genocide. The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, under which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany and defines genocide as crimes committed \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".Dawda Jallow said that \"its words will be meaningless unless they are acted upon and enforced\" in the case of Myanmar. He added that The Gambia was supported in its efforts to seek justice for the Rohingya by the 57 member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, as well as 11 other intervening countries including the UK, France, Germany and Canada. As well as the ICJ case, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating Myanmar's military ruler, Min Aung Hlaing. ",

    "body": "36 minutes agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCOne of these images is a real photo, while the other two have been digitally altered by Grok to change what I'm wearing. Can you tell which is real?Here's me, at the end of a pier in Dorset in the summer.Two of these images were generated using the artificial intelligence tool Grok, which is free to use and belongs to Elon Musk.It's pretty convincing. I've never worn the rather fetching yellow ski suit, or the red and blue jacket - the middle photo is the original - but I don't know how I could prove that if I needed to, because of those pictures.Of course, Grok is under fire for undressing rather than redressing women. And doing so without their consent.It made pictures of people in bikinis, or worse, when prompted by others. And shared the results in public on the social network X. There is also evidence it has generated sexualised images of children.Following days of outrage and condemnation, the UK's online regulator Ofcom has said it is urgently investigating whether Grok has broken British online safety laws.The government wants Ofcom to get on with it - and fast.But Ofcom will have to be thorough and follow its own processes if it wants to avoid criticism of attacking free speech, which has dogged the Online Safety Act from its earliest stages.Elon Musk has been uncharacteristically quiet on the subject in recent days, which suggests even he realises how serious this all is. But he did fire off a post accusing the British government of seeking \"any excuse\" for censorship.Not everyone agrees that on this occasion, the defence is acceptable.\"AI undressing people in photos isn't free speech - it's abuse,\" says campaigner Ed Newton Rex.\"When every photo a woman posts of themselves on X immediately attracts public replies in which they've been stripped down to a bikini, something has gone very, very wrong.\"With all this in mind, Ofcom's investigation could take time, and a lot of back-and-forth – testing the patience of both politicians and the public.It's a major moment not only for Britain's Online Safety Act, but the regulator itself. It can't afford to get this wrong.Ofcom has previously been accused of lacking teeth. The Act, which was years in the making, only came fully into force last year. It has so far issued three relatively small fines for non-compliance, none of which have been paid.The Online Safety Act doesn't specifically mention AI products either. And while it is currently illegal to share intimate, non-consensual images, including deepfakes, it is not currently illegal to ask an AI tool to create them. That's about to change. The government will this week bring into force a law which will make it illegal to create these images.And the UK says it will amend another law - currently going through Parliament - which would make it illegal for companies to supply the tools designed to make them, too.These rules have been around for a while, they're not actually part of the Online Safety Act but a completely different piece of legislation called the Data (Use and Access) Act.They've not been brought into enforcement despite repeated announcements from the government over many months that they were incoming.Today's announcement shows a government determined to quell criticisms that regulation moves too slowly, by showing it can act quickly when it wants to.It's not just Grok that will be affected. A political bombshell?The new law that will be enforced this week could prove to be a headache for other owners of AI tools which are technically mostly capable of generating these images as well.And there are already questions around how on earth it will be enforced - Grok only came under the spotlight because it was publishing its output on X.If a tool is used privately by an individual user, they find a way around the guardrails and the resulting content is only shared with those who want to see it, how will it come to light?If X is found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue it with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, whichever is greater. It could even seek to block Grok or X in the UK. But this could also be a political bombshell.I sat at the AI Summit in Paris last year and watched Vice President JD Vance thunder that the US administration was \"getting tired\" of foreign countries attempting to regulate its tech companies.His audience, which included a huge number of world leaders, sat in stony silence.But the tech firms have a lot of firepower inside the White House – and several of them have also invested billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the UK. Can the country afford to fall out with them?",

    "body": "8 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC News PersianandJessica RawnsleyA referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran.Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian.\"Everyone knew him for his kindness\", they said, adding his family is grieving and \"angry because he was killed by the regime\".Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. \"She fought for things she knew were right\", her uncle told CNN.Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported.Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA).The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA.Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night.The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene.\"It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,\" the friend said.The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: \"From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.\"They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as \"someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery\".\"Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him,\" his friend said. \"The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime.\"Also killed was Aminian, a Kurdish student who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups.Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces.The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death.The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said.\"She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for,\" her uncle told CNN. \"She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard.\"He added that she was \"thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights\". \"Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived.\"Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO.The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said.\"It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes,\" Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source.Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said.The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran.Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers,\" while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering \"very strong options\".Iran has also accused protesters of being backed by the US and Israel.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.",

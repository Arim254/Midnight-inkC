The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "Minnesota immigration enforcement surge is ending, Trump border tsar says16 minutes agoBrandon DrenonUS border tsar: Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge endingThe US immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota will end, President Donald Trump's border tsar told reporters on Thursday.Tom Homan said Trump had approved his request to conclude the operation, adding he would stay in Minnesota \"a little longer to oversee the drawdown, to ensure its success\". Homan said Operation Metro Surge had resulted in many illegal immigrants who had committed violent crimes being detained for deportation. But the surge also sparked nationwide protests after two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration officers.After the news conference, top Minnesota and federal officials appeared at a Capitol HIll hearing on Trump's immigration crackdown.Officials in Minnesota have been able to \"greatly reduce the number of targets\" for immigration enforcement, Homan said, adding that Operation Metro Surge was a \"great success\".More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual misconduct. Homan said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has always had a presence in Minnesota and will continue to have one. The reduction in force comes after what Homan described as an unprecedented level of cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement. He said Minneapolis law enforcement has increased their crackdown on protesters he called public safety threats, and local jails have been more willing to notify ICE of the release date for individuals the agency was targeting.Following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, President Donald Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis to oversee the surge, sidelining the operation's leader Greg Bovino, who had faced intense criticism for ICE's use of force in the city.Trump's immigration crackdown has faced resistance in Democrat-led cities like Minneapolis from activists in the streets and local officials and immigrants in the courts. The fight over how immigration agents operate has now put the federal government at risk of a partial shutdown as Congress debates a funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE. Democrats are demanding changes - such as ending the wearing of masks - in exchange for support for the bill. They are also pushing for immigration agents in Minnesota and elsewhere to be required to reveal their identities and to end warrant-less searches.Last week, Homan announced he was removing 700 immigration agents from the state, leaving around 2,000 federal officers there, and working to cut their presence to where it was before the operation started in December. On Thursday, he said Minnesota has become \"less of a sanctuary state\", adding that he had meetings over the last few weeks with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, whom he asked to \"tone down the rhetoric\".Sanctuary cities and states have passed laws to limit the support they give to enforcement of federal immigration authorities.While Homan and the Trump administration blamed escalating tensions in Minneapolis on the rhetoric from Minnesota officials, Frey and other critics of the immigration crackdown have blamed it on ICE and Customs and Border Protection.

    "body": "Probe ordered into Daily Mail owner's £500m takeover of Telegraph9 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAn investigation into the proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph by the owners of the Daily Mail has been ordered by the government on public interest and competition grounds.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she had launched the probe over concerns the deal  could affect the \"plurality of views\" in the UK media.Competition issues will be assessed by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), while media regulator Ofcom will look at the public interest impact, Nandy said.Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) and Telegraph Media Group have been approached for comment. DMGT, whose titles also include the i Paper, the New Scientist and Metro, agreed to buy the Telegraph in November after years of uncertainty over the paper's future owner.When DMGT announced the takeover, it said the Telegraph would remain editorially independent from its other titles.In issuing the probe into the deal, Nandy said: \"The public interest considerations concerned are the need for a sufficient plurality of views in each UK market for news media; and, the need for a sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises serving every different UK audience.\"She said she had asked the CMA and Ofcom to report back to the government by 10 June.The intervention is the latest twist in the Telegraph's sale, which was put up for sale in 2023 by lenders for previous owners, the Barclay brothers.RedBird Capital's own bid for control of the Telegraph collapsed in November after the US firm pulled out.",

    "body": "Trial date set for Trump's legal case against BBC2 hours agoSteven McIntoshBBCUS President Donald Trump's multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC has been scheduled to go to trial in February 2027, according to court documents.The trial date comes as a Florida judge rejected the BBC's application to delay the process of discovery in the case.Trump is suing the BBC for defamation over the way an episode of Panorama edited two sections of a speech together, which made it appear that he had directly encouraged his supporters to storm the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.The trial is scheduled to last two weeks and take place in Miami. A BBC spokesman said: \"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case.\"The statement added: \"We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\"The BBC has indicated in previous filings that it will submit a motion to dismiss the case by 17 March 2026. The latest order does not impact that forthcoming filing.EPAThe BBC has previously apologised to Trump over the Panorama edit, but rejected his demands for compensation and disagreed there was a basis for a defamation and trade practices claim.The president is seeking damages in relation to the editing of his speech, which his lawyers have claimed was \"false and defamatory\".The corporation's forthcoming motion to dismiss the case is expected to claim the Florida court lacks \"personal jurisdiction\" over it, that the court venue is \"improper\", and that Trump has \"failed to state a claim\", according to court documents.Last month, the BBC asked the court to stay the process of discovery, where each side provides the other with relevant documents and evidence.On Wednesday, the judge denied that request, giving reasons including that the application was \"premature\".",

Truthfully, I was probably a little too old to watch it in my early 20s, but my friends and I would often find ourselves under the duvet on the sofa on a Sunday morning after a big night out, nursing our hangovers with a cuppa and a side of American teen drama.We might have giggled at the unrealistically articulate monologues, but secretly wished we'd also had that pitch-perfect snappy riposte to dole out to a disappointing boyfriend (or two).The hit show was created by Kevin Williamson, who was also behind the Scream franchise and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and has previously described working on the Dawson's Creek as \"a charmed experience\".It followed a group of teenage friends living in the fictional small town of Capeside, Massachusetts, navigating the ups and downs of adolescence.And Dawson Leery - played by James Van Der Beek, who has died aged 48 - was always at the centre of the series, which ran from 1998 to 2003.The aspiring floppy-haired filmmaker could be sensitive but manipulative, loveable yet irritating. And Van Der Beek made the role his own.Getty Images\"The show was built around him,\" Emily Longeretta, director of features at Variety,  told BBC News.\"The creator Kevin Williamson has said many times... that Dawson was based on him [Williamson] and he had to find the right person to do that, and James immediately stepped into that role,\" she added.\"He took this character that was not a jock or the cool kid in high school and... made him loveable, someone that people fall in love with, that was not afraid to be emotional, something that a lot of men on TV, especially young men... it's frowned upon. \"James Van Der Beek was able to do that with such eloquence, his emotional connection and authenticity really came through the screen.\"The show made stars of its key cast, including Dawson's childhood friend and love interest Joey (Katie Holmes), his friend Pacey (Joshua Jackson), new girl in town Jen (Michelle Williams) and Audrey (Busy Philipps).While the series had a very respectable if not huge audience in the US for the time - averaging about six million viewers throughout its run - it was also broadcast in 50 countries, including the UK and Australia, where it enjoyed a cult following. A world away from the glamour of other teen shows such as Beverly Hills 90210, it tackled real-life issues such as loss, grief, sexuality, mental health and heartbreak but in an accessible and gentle way that connected with young viewers.TV critic Scott Bryan told the BBC: \"The show was a breakthrough because it was one of the first that talked to teens like adults. \"It was a show that very much had its heart on its sleeve, with the characters openly talking to each other about their feelings (and their feelings for each other). It didn't look down on its audience, and it featured performances that were more fleshed out than its rivals.\"Indeed, parental figures were very much on the periphery. Joey's mother had died and her father was in prison; Dawson's parents become preoccupied with their divorce; Jen lived with her grandmother and Pacey had a difficult relationship with his alcoholic father.Getty ImagesThe teens were almost precociously self-aware, which admittedly made us roll our eyes at some of the dialogue on occasion.But with few grown-ups available to model emotional literacy, the kids had no choice but to attempt it themselves.The main focus of all the handwringing was, of course, the love triangle between Dawson, Joey and Pacey.Dawson ugly-crying as he \"sets Joey free\" to be with Pacey is still a hugely popular meme. We may have groaned, but, as Anita Singh wrote in the Telegraph on Wednesday: \"It's a testament to Van Der Beek that he maintained the character's popularity and his role at the heart of the series. Nobody wanted this hero to get the girl, but they did want him to be happy.\"Getty ImagesA cast reunion and cancer benefit took place last year; Van Der Beek was too ill to attend but sent a video messageDawson's Creek was also groundbreaking. It featured one of the first gay kisses on primetime US TV - certainly the first between two teenagers - when Jack McPhee (Kerr Smith) and Ethan (Adam Kaufman) locked lips in series three.Television in the 1990s and early Noughties wasn't exactly famed for LGBT inclusion, so the moment when Pacey defended his friend Jack after he was asked by a teacher to read aloud a personal poem he had written about coming out, felt seismic.\"I had taken that whole journey, and I wanted a character on the show to represent that journey and to represent that side of me.\"\"But I'm having a great time,\" he reflected. \"This is what I wanted to do.\"Additional reporting by Kate Moore.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMaia DaviesPATREBob was known to accompany funeral processions and comfort mourners at the siteA dog who spent 10 years living in the São Paulo cemetery where his owner was buried has inspired a new law permitting the burial of pets with their families in the Brazilian state.Nicknamed Bob Coveiro - meaning \"gravedigger\" in Portuguese - the loyal dog brought comfort to mourners and became a fixture at the graveyard until his death in 2021, when he was buried alongside his guardian.The law named after the canine came into effect on Tuesday and recognises the \"emotional bond\" between pets and their human families, the state government said.One of its authors, representative Eduardo Nóbrega, wrote on social media: \"What began as a story of love and loyalty has turned into public policy.\"Bob attended his owner's funeral at the cemetery in Taboão da Serra and refused to leave thereafter, Brazilian media reported - even returning when family members tried to take him home.He was given a green dog house to live in and was known to accompany funeral processions at the site, where he was eventually buried with his owner after being hit by a vehicle in 2021.Local animal protection charity Patre, which led a fundraiser for a statue in his memory, said Bob \"won the hearts of everyone who met him\".It said in a statement: \"People who were saddened by burying their loved ones would manage a smile when the little dog, who was crazy about balls, tried to play.\"Nóbrega said of the Bob Coveiro Law on Wednesday: \"Anyone who has lost a pet knows: it's not just an animal. It's a family. And this law recognizes this bond, bringing more respect at the moment of farewell.\"\"Love does not end at goodbye,\" he wrote on social media.It means cats and dogs can now be buried in family graves in the southeastern state - Brazil's most populous - provided sanitary standards are met, with local funeral services to determine the rules for doing so.Brazil has the world's third-largest pet population, with 160 million animal companions, according to data from the Pet Brasil Institute.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoElla KiplingandHafsa KhalilPA MediaThe billionaire Manchester United co-owner said the UK was \"colonised\" by immigrants Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for \"offending some people\" with his language after saying the UK had been \"colonised by immigrants\", but maintained an \"open debate\" on the matter was needed.The billionaire co-owner of Manchester United had faced criticism from Sir Keir Starmer, who described his comments on Wednesday as \"offensive and wrong\".On Thursday, Sir Jim said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.\"The club has not directly addressed the remarks, but said it \"prides itself\" on being \"inclusive\". \"Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home,\" the club said in a statement on Thursday.\"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.\"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"Sources told BBC Sport that the FA is examining whether Sir Jim's comments brought the game into disrepute.Should the FA formally investigate Sir Jim's comments and choose to charge the 73-year-old under its own rules, he could face further punishment.His earlier comments to Sky News had drawn criticism from Manchester United fan groups. He said: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\"He incorrectly claimed the population of the UK had risen by 12 million to 70 million people in the last five years. The Office for National Statistics estimates it has actually risen from 66.7 million to 69.4 million, an increase of less than three million.A Downing Street spokesperson said it was \"absolutely right\" that Sir Jim had apologised for his language. Following the billionaire's comments to the broadcaster, the prime minister's spokesman said Sir Keir thought they were \"offensive and wrong\" and it is \"absolutely right\" he apologised. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said \"a lot of people find that language offensive\".He added the government has \"done a lot to bear down\" on small boats and there is \"lots we need to do on irregular migration\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage previously pushed back against Sir Keir, saying: \"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.\"Following the apology, Farage said he believes the comments were \"right\".Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Sir Jim's comments \"go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood\".\"Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region.\"Criticism of Sir Jim's remarks also came in from football groups.Anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out called them \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\", while anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said it was \"deeply concerned\".\"Language of this kind echoes narratives that have historically been used to stigmatise migrant communities, fuel division, and legitimise hostility towards minority groups,\" it said in a statement. \"Football clubs and their leadership hold enormous cultural influence.\"Ratcliffe, one of Britain's richest individuals, founded one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos.In 2020, he reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco, which does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.He campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 European Union referendum.Ahead of the 2024 general election, he told Bloomberg he had \"had enough\" of the Tories, putting his support instead behind Labour.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBranwen Jeffreys,Education EditorandNathan StandleyGetty ImagesParents should be involved in the \"vast majority\" of cases where a child questions their gender, according to new government guidance for all English schools.The legally-binding advice says schools should not initiate steps towards social transitioning - when pupils change their name, pronoun or clothes to reflect their gender identity - and should instead consider carefully what other support a child might need.In primary schools in particular, full social transitioning should only happen \"very rarely\", it says.The guidance has been backed by the author of the landmark Cass Review, Dr Hilary Cass, who said the guidance was \"a huge step in the right direction\".Her review of gender care services for under-18s, published in 2024, was commissioned by NHS England after it saw a sharp rise in referrals for patients questioning their gender.Her report said the evidence around medical interventions in gender care was \"remarkably weak\", and there was a lack of research available.The guidance also says there are \"no exceptions\" for single-sex facilities at schools and colleges, including toilets and changing rooms, with single-sex sports also protected.But schools have been given some flexibility over how they deal with issues such as children's names and uniforms.The BBC understands single-sex schools will continue to follow the current admissions code, which allows them to admit pupils only on the basis of their biological sex.Cass said the guidance was \"practical and reflects the recommendations of my review, giving schools much-needed clarity on their legal duties so they can support children with confidence\".Overall, the new guidance also makes a clear distinction between a child's wishes, and what might be in their best interests.There is a reminder that while some children explore different gender identities, most do not go on as adults to fully transition to a different gender from their biological sex.\"What comes across quite strongly in the guidance is that proceeding with a social transition is going to be very much the exception, rather than the rule,\" Cass told the BBC.She emphasised the importance of involving parents wherever possible, saying \"children don't thrive well when there are secrets between them and their parents\".\"Too many times during my review I heard about schools having socially transitioned young people without involving parents, and parents were in possession of all sorts of knowledge about what's going on that the school just wouldn't know about,\" she said.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the new guidance would deliver \"pragmatic support for teachers, reassurance for parents, and above all, the safety and wellbeing of children and young people\".The new advice around children questioning their gender has been included in an update to existing statutory guidance for schools on how to keep children safe.It was first promised in 2018 in England.The long delay has left head teachers navigating one of the most contested social issues on their own.Some have paid for legal advice, while others have taken mitigating steps such as introducing gender-neutral toilets.Thursday's update has been roundly welcomed by head teachers' unions.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools had done a \"very good job\" dealing with the issue during an \"often-polarised public debate\" in recent years.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the guidance would address the need for \"greater clarity about how schools should manage this sensitive issue and support their pupils\".In December 2023, the previous Conservative government had published draft guidance for consultation, which took a harder stance on some issues, including banning the use of alternate pronouns in primary school.But that consultation was overtaken by the calling of a general election in May 2024, which ultimately led to a change of government.A new consultation on Thursday's updated guidance is due to run for 10 weeks.",

The warnings are for both river flooding and groundwater flooding. Areas experiencing river flooding should improve over the next few days but it is a different story in terms of groundwater.Some areas are experiencing flooding because of their geology, with porous chalk below the surface acting like an enormous sponge.That forms an aquafer that is a really important source of drinking water in southern England.

    "body": "3 hours agoErica WitheringtonDisability reporterGetty ImagesMerlin Entertainments has backtracked on its controversial plan to tighten access to its disability queuing system at its theme parks following strong criticism from people with autism, ADHD and anxiety.The company had planned to introduce new eligibility rules for its Ride Access Pass (RAP), which provides a non-queueing option for people unable to stand in long lines.Under the plan, visitors to places like Alton Towers, Chessington World of Adventures and Legoland Windsor this half-term who only had \"difficulty with crowds\" would no longer have qualified.Merlin said it had \"listened carefully to the extensive feedback\" and decided to \"pause the trial while we explore alternative options\".'They've told us loud and clear'The theme park owner addressed those people \"impacted\" by their previous announcement, saying: \"We are sorry.\"The move sparked widespread upset among adults with autism, ADHD and anxiety and families of neurodivergent children - who said the changes risked shutting many people out of a system they rely on.Merlin announced on Thursday that it will not go ahead with the trial following \"extensive feedback\". Rob Smith, the company's chief operating officer, said the company had heard from many RAP users who felt the proposed changes would worsen accessibility rather than improve it. \"Whenever we make changes to the Ride Access Pass, it's because we genuinely want to improve the experience for guests who rely on it,\" he said.\"They've told us loud and clear that the current system isn't working.\"Smith said the need to change the disability queuing system remained because the Ride Access Pass was \"under huge pressure\", but that the company believed it was \"important to take the time to fully reflect\" on the feedback.He added: \"For those who were impacted by our recent announcement, we are sorry.\" With more and more people claiming the pass, some disabled visitors were facing longer waits than the main queue, which the company said was \"not the experience we want for anyone\".Merlin said it will now launch a broader consultation with disabled guests, accessibility specialists and other operators across the attractions industry.What sparked the backlash?Last week, BBC News revealed that Alton Towers planned to stop automatically granting its disability queuing pass to some guests with autism, ADHD, anxiety and other non-physical disabilities, if their Nimbus access pass only indicated they struggled being in crowds.Many families contacted BBC Your Voice to express their frustration and to say that it would stop them from taking their neurodivergent children to the Merlin theme parks they loved. Some described the proposed system as \"unworkable\", while charities warned it risked creating new barriers in an already difficult environment.The now-aborted plan followed an update by the disability access card provider Nimbus Disability which Merlin uses to verify additional needs.Nimbus has split its former \"standing and queuing\" card section into two separate symbols: \"difficulty standing\" (a physical need) and \"difficulty with crowds\" (often linked to neurodivergence or anxiety).Nimbus Disability Managing director Martin Austin said: \"We developed the Access Card in response to frustrations shared by disabled people and venues about how disability was evidenced.\"Merlin has been considering how these criteria relate to its Ride Access Pass...  Accessibility is constantly evolving and improving, and we welcome Merlin's willingness to listen to feedback.\"Nimbus said it remained in \"close dialogue\" with Merlin and the wider industry about how its system might best support both disabled guests and operators. The British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers & Attractions (BALPPA) said that pressure on accessibility systems went beyond the parks owned by Merlin.\"British attractions have made significant progress with accessibility, but are facing operational challenges with increasing demand from guests,\" BALPPA chief executive Paul Kelly said.\"We support Nimbus's continued efforts... Their input will be invaluable as we continue to evolve our approach.\"What happens now?Merlin will continue using its existing RAP criteria, including acceptance of the Access Card \"crowd\" symbol as it currently operates. A video message from Smith has been issued to visitors explaining the decision.",

As a family, together with Robin's close friends, we can now begin to move forward and attempt, over time, to rebuild our lives.\"We wish to express sincere gratitude to everyone who has shown us kindness, compassion and support throughout the long and difficult period since Robin's passing.\"Thank you to everyone who has remembered Robin and marked his life with such love.\"'Deep affection'After the jury's conclusion, coroner Dr Anton van Dellen said: \"I hope the family can take some comfort from the joy that Robin brought to so many people and the positive effect he had. That is a wonderful legacy.\"Addressing Windsor's family at the front of the courtroom, the coroner added: \"I hope you can think of the happy times he brought to the public and the deep affection the public held him in.\"A BBC spokesman said: \"Our sympathies are with Robin's family, friends, and all who knew him. The whole of the Strictly Come Dancing family remain deeply saddened by his passing. Robin was a much loved member of the team - both on and off air - during his time on the show.\"As the inquest has heard this week and the jury concluded, several complex factors contributed to how Robin felt at the time of his tragic death and our thoughts remain with all who knew and loved Robin.\"Earlier this week, the inquest heard from friends and co-stars that being dropped from Strictly, along with money and relationship problems, contributed to a downturn in his mental health.Those giving evidence included actress Lisa Riley, one of his Strictly dance partners, who said he slipped \"deeper and deeper into endless depression\" after leaving the TV show, and talked about occasions when he was \"drowning in debts\" and struggling with \"failing\" relationships.One of Windsor's ex-boyfriends, singer and X Factor star Marcus Collins, said the dancer \"deteriorated\" in 2014 after being told he was no longer required for Strictly, which \"really broke his spirit\".Collins added that Windsor subsequently \"struggled to balance his mental health and finances\", and that from 2016 to 2024 \"his mental health was pretty compromised and relationships with friends and partners came and went\".The coroner's court also heard that Windsor had left a note saying his problems started when he lost his job on Strictly, and referenced struggles with loneliness and relationships, among the triggers for his troubles.Windsor, from Ipswich, also partnered Patsy Kensit, Anita Dobson and Deborah Meaden on Strictly, and Sara Cox and Alison Hammond in Christmas specials.If you are suffering distress or despair and need support, a list of organisations that can help is available at bbc.co.uk/actionline.",

    "body": "Nottingham Forest are close to appointing former Wolves boss Vitor Pereira as their new head coach.The Premier League club sacked Sean Dyche shortly after being held to a goalless draw by bottom club Wolves on Wednesday, leaving them three points above the relegation zone with 12 games remaining.BBC Sport earlier reported Forest had opened talks with Pereira and those discussions are understood to have progressed with an agreement now described as close.The 57-year-old quickly emerged as the preferred option to replace Dyche, having worked previously under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis at Greek club Olympiacos.Pereira was credited for keeping Wolves in the Premier League last season having joined midway through the campaign, but he was sacked in November with the club on two points from 10 matches.The Portuguese is in line to become Forest's fourth manager of the season following Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Dyche.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic CorrespondentandKayleen Devlin,BBC VerifyBBCOn 26 January, staff in an office in Mumbai received an urgent e-mail from a crew member aboard a tanker off the coast of Singapore.The email, purportedly written on behalf of five colleagues aboard the tanker sailing under the name Beeta, contained a litany of complaints: crew members, it was alleged, had not been paid and were being treated \"like animals\"; and provisions were running low.The staff in Mumbai worked for the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), the world's leading organisation representing seafarers, and were used to dealing with complaints from all corners of the globe.But what caught their eye was the fact that the emails hadn't just been copied to multiple ITF offices, but also to sanctions enforcement bodies in several countries.\"The vessel is sanctioned and blacklisted,\" the sailor wrote.He said he had discovered that the vessel calling itself the Beeta was in fact an American-sanctioned tanker called the Gale.The sailor and his colleagues were desperate to leave.\"I've been at sea for many years,\" he told the BBC when we contacted him. \"I know what's right and wrong.\"Inadvertently, the crew member had found himself involved in a problem at the heart of some of today's most contentious geopolitical issues: a surging number of tankers, transporting Russian and Iranian oil, operating outside maritime rules, using a variety of methods to conceal their identities.This \"shadow fleet\", as it's known, is growing fast.ITFThis image shows the American sanctioned tanker called the GaleEstimates vary, but the latest data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com says the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.That's about 18-19% of the total internationally trading tanker fleet, carrying approximately 17% of all seaborne crude, says Michelle Wiese Bockman, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI.The phenomenon that first emerged in the 2010s, as North Korea and Iran sought to evade international sanctions, has proliferated, leaving western governments scrambling to keep up.So what can those governments do when countries circumvent or flout the rules to export oil and use the profits to fuel engines of war or repression?'Modern-day slavery'Definitions vary - as do names: it's also been called the \"dark\" or \"ghost\" fleet - but shadow vessels generally exhibit some or all of a particular set of characteristics.They tend to be old, averaging an age of around 20 years, and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed. Insurance is below Western standards and sometimes fake.Vessels frequently switch off or manipulate their automatic identification system (AIS), making them harder to track.Seamen, recruited on contracts that typically last six to nine months, don't always know what they're getting into.\"I didn't understand what shadow fleet vessels actually were,\" Russian engineer Denis told us, after serving aboard an EU- and UK-sanctioned tanker, Serena, for several months last year.Serena is currently flying under the flag of Cameroon. While Denis was aboard, it was flying a false Gambian flag.Denis says he realised the Serena was under sanctions only when he went aboard. But like many seamen, he says he needed the work.\"Once they're at sea, they've got them prisoner on board,\" says Nathan Smith, an ITF inspector familiar with the Serena.Smith has heard numerous stories of abuses aboard shadow vessels.\"It's a modern-day slavery,\" he says.Over the course of months spent sailing between Russia and China, the reality of life aboard a shadow vessel became increasingly apparent to Denis.\"Things began to deteriorate very quickly because no spare parts were sent,\" he said. \"The radar on the bridge hadn't been working for over a year, the life-saving equipment wasn't working and there were numerous faulty fire sensors.\"During a stop at the Russian port of Vladivostok, last October, the crew tried, without success, to repair a davit, a small specialised crane used to lower the tanker's life boats into the water. Denis says a port official nevertheless issued a certificate of successful inspection. The BBC has approached the Port of Vladivostok for comment.Denis says he never found out who owned the Serena or who crew members could contact to raise complaints.It's notoriously difficult to establish ownership of shadow fleet vessels. Ships have registered owners, which are often shell companies or entities set up to manage a single vessel. The names of real, or \"beneficial\" owners are frequently hidden. We have tried to make contact with the owners of the Gale and Serena, but without success. In the case of the Gale, it has proved impossible to establish the identity of the beneficial owner.Crews are poorly protected throughout the industry, with unpaid wages and abandonment by owners all-too frequent. But Denis says shadow vessels are the worst.\"Now I'll be more careful,\" he says. \"I've learned to identify dangerous vessels that I won't work on any more.\"The ships brought back from the deadDeep within the murky recesses of the shadow fleet also lurks a category experts have dubbed \"zombie ships\" - vessels which steal the identity of dead ships in order to hide their true identity.After being sanctioned, a zombie ship often disappears from tracking systems, later reappearing under a new name, using a stolen nine-digit International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number from a scrapped or decommissioned vessel.The ship's AIS tracking system, which uses transponders to continuously broadcast its location, is re-programmed to imitate the previous vessel.With the dead tanker's identity magically resurrected, the zombie ship continues to ply its trade, free from sanctions.The Gale is one such ship.According to the global trade intelligence company Kpler, the tanker, currently flying a false Gambian flag, has assumed multiple identities since being sanctioned by the US last year for its involvement in the export of sanctioned Iranian oil.After a period sailing under the false identity Sea Shell, using a different stolen IMO number, the Gale again changed identities, re-emerging as Beeta and loading a cargo of Iranian oil on 31 January.According to TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite imagery, AIS data and shoreline photography to follow the movement of crude oil, the shipment was delivered by another US-sanctioned vessel via a ship-to-ship transfer, a procedure commonly used by shadow-fleet vessels involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil.Copernicus Sentinel 2, 2026Satellite imagery shows the Gale (Beeta) loading a cargo of Iranian oil in a ship-to-ship tranferThe ship-to-ship transfer took place south of the Riau Archipelago, around 150 miles east of Singapore.Windward AI's Michelle Wiese Bockmann calls the area \"an epicentre of maritime lawlessness\", where dozens of tankers gather to store or transfer Iranian oil.Bockmann says China imported 1.8 million barrels per day of sanctioned Iranian crude per day in 2025. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy for a response.\"None of it was traced,\" she says, \"because tankers hide their loading and the oil has come on four or five tankers, deliberately to obscure the origin and destination of the cargo.\"The Gale's history and behaviour mark it out as a classic zombie ship.A computer screenshot taken on board by the crew member who contacted the ITF appears to give instructions on how to fake the ship's location, a process known as spoofing.Two other screenshots, taken on 26 January, show the spoofing at work.One displays the tanker's actual location, east of Singapore. The second, taken just five minutes later, shows a fake location, around 2,800 miles away, off the coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.\"The confirmed linkage between Gale, Sea Shell, and Beeta, alongside fabricated AIS position history and prior impersonation, is consistent with deliberate identity manipulation,\" says Ana Subasic, an analyst at the global trade intelligence company Kpler.The BBC has no reason to believe the Serena is a zombie vessel, but the ship's former engineer says he saw equipment that would enable the Serena to fake its position.\"I spoke with the bridge officers about turning off the AIS and other manipulation,\" Denis told us. \"We had equipment on board to change the vessel's position. I think this equipment is only used for sanctioned cargo.\"What can be done?Such practices, coupled with the knowledge that Russian and Iranian oil revenues continue to fuel conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, are driving an urgent debate in western capitals about how to respond.Donald Trump's recent actions in Venezuela – seizing seven tankers since early December as part of a pressure campaign on the regime of then president Nicolás Maduro – has shown that one solution is the simple application of force.The operation to chase and capture one vessel, the Russian-flagged tanker Marinera, took the US military, including a coastguard vessel and special forces, on a two-week chase far out into the North Atlantic.The Marinera, previously known as the Guyanese-flagged Bella 1, was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and Iran.Getty ImagesBella 1, renamed Marinera, was intercepted in the early hours of 7 JanuaryThe change of name and flag was designed to provide the tanker with a measure of international protection.Upping the ante further, Russia took the highly unusual step of requesting that the US call off its pursuit and said it had dispatched a submarine to escort the tanker, which was empty at the time. The Russian Foreign Ministry said there was not \"any basis\" to allege the tanker was sailing \"without a flag\" or \"under a false flag\".Undeterred by the possibility of an international incident or by the possible accusation of piracy on the high seas, the US intercepted the Marinera in international waters between Iceland and the UK in the early hours of 7 January.Getty ImagesThe Russian-flagged Marinera - seen in January in Burghead, Scotland - was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and IranFor the first time, the UK got involved, sending an RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship to help the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\" and said the UK was \"stepping up activity against shadow vessels\".Perhaps spurred on by Washington's assertive approach, there is some evidence that European partners are willing to take more robust action too.Two weeks after the Marinera episode, France launched an operation in the Mediterranean to seize the Grinch, another Russia-linked tanker suspected of violating international sanctions.ReutersA French navy boat stopping the Grinch oil tankerOnce again, the UK was involved. A Royal Navy patrol boat, HMS Dagger, shadowed the Grinch, as it passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.With at least one sanctioned vessel passing through the English Channel every day, according to experts, speculation is mounting that the UK might soon conduct its own interceptions.Healey recently told MPs that \"further military options\" were being explored.For some, it can't come soon enough.\"There's obviously huge frustration in the policy-maker circles in Brussels and London that Russia is continuing to sell its oil,\" says Tom Keatinge, founding director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.Keatinge runs a maritime sanctions task force at Rusi, bringing together representatives from industry and government. Some participants, he sees, are keen to see more forthright action.\"We have people… who like jumping out of helicopters on ropes,\" he says. \"And that community has thus far been kept firmly in its box.\"He adds: \"Put bluntly, no one's had the balls to look at what is often a 50-50 call and say 'We'll send the boys in'.\" The MoD said: \"Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government.\"But the constraints are considerable.\"You've got a bunch of consequences that you need to be ready to deal with,\" Keatinge says. \"The first is you've got an absolutely enormous vessel. What the hell do you do with that?\"Once seized, tankers need to be maintained, with engines running and a skeleton crew on board. The appetite for holding such vessels, particularly older ones that might pose an environmental risk, is minimal.The Marinera remains moored in the Moray Firth, with other US-seized vessels being held off the coast of Texas and Puerto Rico.\"If you look at the very high costs that the US is probably incurring at the moment to have two tankers off Houston, awaiting legal action, it's not something you take lightly,\" says Bockmann.A problem of resourcesThen there's the question of what to do with the oil itself.Again, Trump's approach is blunt: confiscate it.The president says 50 million barrels have been taken so far, as the US assumes control of Venezuela's oil industry.\"Venezuela is going to get some and we're going to get some,\" he said in a recent interview.The president's European allies are unlikely to follow suit.\"That would probably be a step too far for the Foreign Office,\" says Keatinge.So would Ukraine's increasingly direct approach. In recent months, Kyiv has targeted at least seven Russian shadow fleet tankers, using a variety of drones and mines.ReutersA Ukrainian sea drone shows the Dashan, a tanker part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\", being struck by another sea drone in the Black SeaMost of Ukraine's attacks have been in the Black Sea, but one tanker, the Qendil, was hit and critically damaged while passing through the Mediterranean in December. Another tanker, the Mersin, was attacked and immobilised off the coast of Senegal in late November. Kyiv has not commented on reports that it carried out the attack.Most of the international effort so far has been more bureaucratic than kinetic: sanctioning hundreds of vessels, persuading countries such as The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Comoros, among others, to tighten their regulations, and addressing the issue of insurance.The number of falsely flagged ships globally more than doubled last year to over 450, according to the IMO, the BBC reported in November.Last year, the European Commission introduced new rules requiring all vessels entering EU waters to provide proof of insurance.The UK has a similar, voluntary reporting scheme, but shadow fleet vessels often ignore it or alter course when challenged.Ultimately, the sheer number of shadow vessels poses a simple problem of resources.But with Russian ships sometimes suspected of involvement in the monitoring or sabotage of undersea cables, there's an added national security dimension.In late January, the UK and thirteen other countries with Baltic and North Sea coastlines issued a coordinated warning that AIS manipulation, along with interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems represented a growing threat to maritime safety and security.Vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the statement said, \"may be treated as a ship without nationality\", under the terms of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a reminder to anyone paying attention that existing laws already provide for the detention and seizure of ships.Windward AI's Bockmann says the Trump administration's actions over Venezuela have shown European leaders what can be done.\"There's definitely a low threshold [for intervention] building for the darkest of the dark fleet,\" she says.More from InDepthThe net is gradually closing on Russian oil. Last October, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on the country's two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.The EU's next sanctions package against Russia may include a full ban on maritime services, making it impossible for European tankers to transport Russian oil under the legal price cap currently in place.Around 30% of Russia's maritime oil exports are currently carried on EU-owned vessels.But for Russia and Iran, war and sanctions are the mothers of invention. As the net tightens, you can be sure that the world's burgeoning fleet of shadow vessels will continue to operate in the dark.Top picture: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "6 hours agoJoe Pike,Politics investigations correspondentandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterAlamyLord Doyle, Sir Keir Starmer's former director of communications, has been suspended from Labour's parliamentary party over his links with a convicted sex offender.The peer said he would not take the Labour whip and apologised for his past association with Sean Morton, a former Labour councillor in Moray who admitted indecent child image offences in 2017.It comes after the Sunday Times reported that Lord Doyle campaigned for Morton after he was charged with possessing and distributing indecent images of children in December 2016.\"At the point of my campaigning support, Morton repeatedly asserted to all those who knew him his innocence, including initially in court,\" Lord Doyle said.He added: \"To have not ceased support ahead of a judicial conclusion was a clear error of judgement for which I apologise unreservedly.\"Those of us who took [Morton] at his word were clearly mistaken. I have never sought to dismiss or diminish the seriousness of the offences for which he was rightly convicted. They are clearly abhorrent and I have never questioned his conviction.\"Following his conviction any contact was extremely limited and I have not seen or spoken to him in years. Twice I was at events organised by other people, which he attended, and once I saw him to check on his welfare after concerns were raised through others.\"Lord Doyle, a veteran Labour spin doctor who was the party's head of press between 1998 and 2005 before working for Lord Blunkett and Sir Tony Blair, was given a peerage by Sir Keir in December. He was sworn in as a member of the House of Lords last month. The Sunday Times first reported about Lord Doyle's campaigning for Morton in December last year and last week the Conservatives called for details of the peer's vetting to be published.A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"All complaints are assessed thoroughly in line with our rules and procedures.\"The party is undertaking an investigation and Lord Doyle's Labour whip in the House of Lords has been withdrawn while this is ongoing.Sir Keir faced questions about Lord Doyle's peerage on Monday during a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, when the prime minister rallied MPs behind his leadership.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch wrote to Sir Keir last week to call on him to \"explain why you appointed another friend of a child sex offender to a prestigious post\".It comes after the PM confirmed he had appointed Lord Mandelson to the role of US ambassador despite knowing about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The PM apologised to Epstein's victims for believing Mandelson's \"lies\" about the extent of his relationship with the financier.After Lord Doyle was suspended, Badenoch said the PM must \"come clean about what he was told\" before making Doyle a peer, adding: \"We won't let this go.\"Asked if Lord Doyle should remain a member of the House of Lords, Labour Party chair Anna Turley told Sky News: \"No, I don't think he should. That's my personal view.\"Getty ImagesPam Duncan-Glancy has stepped down as Scottish Labour's education spokesperson over her links to MortonLabour have also suspended the party whip in the Scottish Parliament from MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy.A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \"All complaints are assessed thoroughly in line with our rules and procedures.\"Duncan-Glancy stood down as her party's education spokesperson in December and will quit the Scottish Parliament in May over her friendship with Morton.In December, she admitted a \"serious error of personal judgement\" after it emerged she maintained contact with the former Labour councillor following his 2017 conviction.The Daily Record has since reported that Duncan-Glancy continued her friendship with Morton after he was jailed for further offences and that he attended her birthday party late last year.Morton was jailed in January last year after pleading guilty to possessing indecent photographs of children and breaching his sexual offences order. He was given two 16-month sentences, backdated to May 2024.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBC\"Terror probe into school stabbing\" is the headline in the Daily Telegraph following an attack on two boys, aged 12 and 13, in North London. The two pupils remain in hospital. A 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, the paper writes. A picture of teary-eyed Norwegian Olympic athlete Sturla Holm Lagried also makes the front page in \"the Olympic cheating scandal you didn't expect\". Lagried told press he had cheated on his girlfriend after winning a bronze medal in \"one of the most unusual interviews in Olympic history\".The Times also features the counter-terrorism police's investigation into the stabbing at Kingsbury High School, highlighting the head teacher's description of the event as \"deeply traumatic\". It also says the investigation into Lord Mandelson's relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will \"go back to Blair era\". The peer's appointment to the position of British ambassador to the US has come under fresh scrutiny after the latest release of Epstein files by the US Department of Justice. It was publicly known at the time of the appointment that Lord Mandelson had maintained a relationship with Epstein after his conviction for a child sex offence. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Guardian says Health Secretary Wes Streeting is \"still intent on deposing PM despite united front\".  His allies tell the paper they expect he will make an attempt to topple Sir Keir Starmer \"within weeks\".Allies of the PM \"admit Starmer is too 'weak' to sack Streeting after coup speculation\", according to the Financial Times. The paper also reports on US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick who has said he visited Epstein's island in 2012.                                                                           The i Paper headlines on the news of Lord Doyle losing the Labour whip \"over link to sex offender\". The prime minister's \"ex-No 10 spin doctor\" was suspended after he campaigned for Labour councillor Sean Morton who was charged with possessing indecent images of children in 2017. He has apologised for his past association with Morton.The Daily Express highlights comments from Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch that Labour's taxes are a \"shameful assault\" on high streets. This comes \"amid warnings that small firms face an apocalypse\", the paper writes. The Daily Star calls Starmer a \"limp lettuce\" in a nod to its livestream of a lettuce during Liz Truss's premiership. It says that Larry the No 10 cat is \"fed up with Labour's in-fighting\", headlining with \"get miaowt of here\". \"Leo was gentle and kind... the heartbreak will never end\" headlines the Mirror on the comments from the father of 12-year-old Leo Ross, killed in a stabbing in Birmingham. There is a \"knives epidemic in our schools\" says the Mirror. The Daily Mail leads with the North London stabbing, saying witnesses claim the attacker shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" at the time. The paper also says it has revealed \"where shamed Fergie's hiding - while plotting return\".The Sun leads with the story of Strictly Come Dancing's Robin Windsor's suicide note, which it says detailed that he was \"destroyed\" by Strictly. The inquest continues.Metro leads with the story of a \"DIY drugs baron\" who it says \"rigged his house with Home Alone-style booby traps inlcuding a flame-thrower to stop intruders\".

    "body": "1 hour agoChris MasonPolitical editorReutersThe prime minister wore the smiles of a survivor and his team wore expressions of relief.The Panshanger Community Centre in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, was bedecked with Union flag bunting and plastic chairs.I was there as it was my turn to conduct what is known as a pool interview on behalf of all of the broadcasters.At the start of the year, Sir Keir Starmer had hoped trips like this would be a regular focus.On the first day back in January he invited us reporters to a similar community centre in Reading. But loads of the questions were about Venezuela and Greenland.A later planned trip was postponed and a news conference held in Downing Street instead, such were the dominance and volume of international news.Sir Keir has long been keen to talk about the cost of living, but the opportunity cost of chaos, both international and then domestic, has made that a whole lot harder. The space to be heard gets squeezed.A cabinet minister expressed this frustration to me the other day: they felt there was evidence slowly emerging of things picking up economically, but not the capacity to talk about it.Maybe, just maybe, they may get a chance now.The magnitude of Monday, the genuine peril the prime minister faced, meant that many including some officials in Downing Street thought for at least a while that Sir Keir might have to announce his resignation before the day was out - as our chief political correspondent, Henry Zeffman, reports here.But the scale and imminence of the threat prompted the depth and breadth of hastily expressed and (potentially time-limited) support we then saw from the cabinet and later from MPs.It has cleared some political air for Sir Keir for now.But the fundamentals, the catalysts that drove events towards this week's crescendo, remain unaltered.An unpopular government led by an unpopular prime minister will continue to prompt those on his own side to ponder alternative leaders, unless it and he respectively become less unpopular pretty quickly.But it is also true that for many, many Labour MPs, whatever their view of their leader, the prospect of a turbulent leadership contest, while in government, feels irresponsible and potentially very damaging to them.And yet tricky imminent elections point to headaches on the horizon.In the meantime Downing Street has to deal with the consequences of how the last few weeks have played out.The prime minister is having to make the best of things with Anas Sarwar, Labour's leader in Scotland, who publicly called for him to resign. Sir Keir still wants Sarwar to become Scotland's first minister. But the Labour campaign looks awkward, to put it gently, given the two men are at odds on the fundamental of whether Sir Keir is up to being prime minister.Then there is the Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who appears to be able to get away with rather a lot while remaining in the cabinet. Streeting's decision, off his own bat, to publish his text exchanges with Lord Mandelson prompted the prime minister to issue a coded rebuke of his health secretary. By publicly underlining the importance of a \"managed process\" for the release of material relating to the former ambassador, he was signalling Streeting's unilateral release of exchanges clearly wasn't.It is a reminder of just how much material is due to be published relating to Lord Mandelson in the coming months, with huge potential for embarrassment personally and diplomatically.For now, though, the prime minister appears fired up.The adrenalin, frustration and anger provoked by recent days was visible publicly, which is rare for Sir Keir.How much changes now, and how much you notice, are two of the key questions as the prime minister attempts to reset, yet again.",

    "body": "Boy arrested for attempted murder after two pupils stabbed at school4 hours agoJames W KellyLondonPA MediaOfficers arrived on the scene within 13 minutes, the Met Police saidA 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after two boys were stabbed at a school in north-west London. Officers were called to Kingsbury High School at about 12:40 on Tuesday following reports a 13-year-old boy had been stabbed. Police say they were later made aware that a second victim, a 12-year-old boy, had also been stabbed at the scene. Both boys were taken to hospital, with one admitted to a major trauma centre as a priority. Officers said they were both believed to be in a serious condition.Counter-terror officers are leading the investigation but it has not been declared a terrorist incident, the Met Police said.Weapon recoveredDet Ch Supt Luke Williams said armed and local officers were at the scene within 13 minutes of the 999 call.The suspect, he said, left the scene following the stabbings but was later arrested.According to Williams, a weapon believed to have been used in the attack was recovered and the suspect remained in custody for questioning.Officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the stabbings, the police spoksman told a press conference on Tuesday evening. \"This is a fast-moving and developing investigation,\" he added.\"At this very early stage, we are keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this attack. However, due to the surrounding circumstances, the investigation is now being led by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing London, who are working closely with our local officers in response to this incident.\"He added: \"I absolutely recognise that this incident will cause considerable concern among the local community, students and parents. Our officers will remain in the area to offer support and answer any questions.\"PA MediaDet Ch Supt Luke Williams updated media at the school on Tuesday eveningAccording to witnesses quoted by the Daily Mail, the suspect is alleged to have shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", meaning \"God is greatest\" in Arabic, during the attack.Pupils, some of whom were in tears, and parents were still leaving the school on Tuesday evening after being spoken to by police.One father, whose child in year eight was kept in the school as a potential witness, said: \"They're holding up the kids who were in the class.\"The man, who did not wish to be named, added: \"Obviously, they must be traumatised by what happened in front of them.\"The head teacher of Kingsbury High School, Alex Thomas, said in a letter to parents and carers it had been a \"deeply traumatic event for the whole school community\".\"I am very sorry to inform you that there was a serious incident at school today in which two students were stabbed,\" he said. \"Our thoughts and best wishes are with our students and their families at this incredibly difficult time.\"'Deeply distressing'Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said her thoughts and prayers were with the two pupils.She posted on X: \"A shocking attack at Kingsbury High School, where two children have been stabbed.\"My thoughts and my prayers are with them, their families and all those affected.\"The police have arrested the suspect, and I would like to thank them for their rapid work in doing so. We must now give them the space to pursue their investigation.\"Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan said there was \"no honour in staying silent\" as he urged anyone with information to contact the police.In the statement issued on Tuesday evening, Sir Sadiq said:  \"My thoughts are with the family, friends and wider community in Brent following the appalling stabbings today.\"He added: \"The Met have deployed significant resources to the area and I urge anyone with information to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.\"Muhammed Butt, leader of Brent Council, said the double stabbing was \"deeply shocking and distressing\".\"No parent should ever have to fear for their child's safety at school, and it is horrifying to think of how someone so young came to be in possession of a weapon capable of causing such harm,\" he said.The Labour councillor thanked the emergency services and school staff for their \"swift response\" and said the council would offer its \"full and unlimited support\" to those affected.Kingsbury High School is an academy school serving children aged 11 to 18, with both upper and lower sites.According to the latest Department for Education information, it has 1,997 pupils.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandClaire KeenanReutersBritney Spears has sold the rights to her music catalogue.Pop superstar Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue, the BBC has learned. Spears, 44, is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m (£146m).The singer - whose protracted conservatorship long dictated her personal and professional life - is known for the hits ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Toxic and Gimme More.Primary Wave did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Spears declined to comment.In January 2024, the singer said she would \"never return to the music industry\". Her last song was a duet released with Elton John in 2022. Primary Wave has also acquired rights to the estates of Notorious BIG, Prince and Whitney Houston. Details of the sale and the exact price of Spears' catalogue have not been made public. High-profile artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira recently sold their catalogues too. Springsteen sold his back catalogue to Sony in 2021 for $500m, and Bieber reportedly signed a $200m deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023.The publisher was founded 20 years ago by music executive Lawrence Mestel after purchasing 50% of Kurt Cobain's portion of the Nirvana catalogue. Spears is one of the best-selling female artists, with more than 150 million records sold worldwide. Her catalogue includes nine studio albums since her debut in 1999. The sale comes after a tumultuous few years for the singer, who in 2021 ended a 13-year-long conservatorship – a legal guardianship that saw her finances and personal life controlled by her father. The singer published her memoir in 2023 titled The Woman in Me, which detailed her struggles living under the conservatorship. Her ex-husband Kevin Federline released his own memoir, You Thought You Knew, at the end of 2025. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterPA MediaMany school buildings in England are still ageing and fragile, a new report from MPs says, despite good progress being made in removing an unsafe type of concrete which led to dozens of school closures in 2023.The government has said all schools will be free of Raac (reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete), or in the process of a rebuild, by the end of the current parliamentary term in 2029.But the cross-party education committee's report said pupils' learning and wellbeing had been impacted by the disruption.The government is launching a 10-year plan to transform school and college buildings, which Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called a \"turning point\".\"For too long, schools and colleges have been forced to patch and mend buildings that have already deteriorated - spending their time worrying about leaking roofs instead of focusing on what matters most: giving every child the best possible education,\" she said.The education committee's report focused on Raac, a cheaper alternative to standard concrete which was used in lots of buildings between the 1950s and 1990s, but had a more limited lifespan of about 30 years.The report said some schools still had closures in place, with pupils having to use marquees or modular buildings for lessons and break times.In the committee's report, MPs said the government had made important progress in tackling the issue, but that there were still gaps in the information available on the wider school estate in England.The government has allocated £2.4 billion in 2025/26 to improve the condition of the school and college estate.\"While this may require a great deal of work to fix, the quality of school buildings has a significant impact on pupils' learning and every child deserves to be taught in a safe, secure and fit for purpose school environment,\" Helen Hayes, chair of the education committee, said.The committee's report also said the work to fix school buildings should include efforts to make them inclusive for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).As part of its 10-year plan, the government has said all secondary schools will in future be expected to have an \"inclusion base\" - currently called SEND units or pupil support units in some schools - where pupils with SEND can access support away from busy classrooms.It is part of a drive to deliver more SEND support in mainstream schools, the government said, ahead of the expected announcement of wider reforms in the forthcoming schools white paper.",

    "body": "If it feels like the rain just hasn't stopped this year, you might be on to something. Cardinham in Cornwall has recorded some rain every single day of the year so far.Katesbridge (County Down) and Aboyne (Aberdeenshire) recorded nearly four times their January average rainfall, and history is repeating itself this month. We're not even at the half way point of the month and Aboyne has already had well over double the February average rainfall.As wet as this winter has been, it's unlikely to beat the rainfall of the wettest winter on record, the winter of 2013-14.In the south-west England and South Wales region, data from the Met Office shows that 691mm of rain fell then, causing widespread severe flooding. Combining the figures for December 2025 and January 2026 gives us 415mm, but already the record looks to be far out of reach.One parallel between this winter and the winter of 2013-14 is the damage done to the main railway line at Dawlish that connects southwest England to the rest of the rail network. You might remember in February 2014 that the track was left dangling precariously high in the air as storms washed away the protecting sea wall. This winter has also seen a section of sea wall collapse due to the onslaught of storms causing some disruption.Why so wet? Around 17 January a blocking area of high pressure developed in Scandinavia and it's still there to this day. This has prevented areas of low pressure from moving beyond the UK, so they've become slow-moving, bringing very wet weather, with south-west winds to the south of the UK and south-easterly winds to the north of the UK. This wind pattern is responsible for the distribution of rain. It's worth pointing out that it hasn't been wet everywhere. North-west England and west Scotland had a much drier January than normal, and parts of the Highlands have only recorded 1mm of rain so far this month.The Scandinavian blocking area of high pressure is finally going to budge this week, allowing our weather to turn colder with some hill snow in the north later this week.Next week our weather patterns will become more typical for the time of year with the Atlantic jet stream returning to the north-west of Scotland, rather than taking an unusual position near Morocco. There will still be rain around as we'd expect in winter, but some of the wettest weather will return to west Scotland. The rain won't be as extreme in east Scotland. In the southwest of England, it won't rain every single day, there will be drier and sunnier days between our weather systems.Heading towards the end of February, there are hints that an area of high pressure may visit our shores, bringing some more settled weather conditions. It's a long way off, but it's the least we deserve given just how wet and dull it's been over recent weeks. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoJessica RawnsleyPA MediaForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper boards a helicopter during her visit to Norway to discuss Nato's presence in the ArcticThe number of British troops in Norway will double over the next three years as part of efforts to combat Russian threats in the High North.Defence Secretary John Healey said the number of armed forces personnel stationed in the Arctic nation would rise from around 1,000 to 2,000.The commitment follows increasing concern among Nato allies about Russia's activities in the Arctic, including the reopening of old Cold War bases and a growing military presence in the region.\"Demands on defence are rising and Russia poses the greatest threat to Arctic and High North security that we have seen since the Cold War,\" Healey said.The defence secretary will join Nato counterparts at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the proposals.As part of the expanded presence, 1,500 Royal Marine Commandos will take part in Nato's Exercise Cold Response in March. The large-scale drill across Norway, Finland and Sweden is designed to train allied forces in extreme Arctic conditions.In September, the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force will conduct an exercise known as Lion Protector involving air, land and naval forces from several European nations. That operation will train armed forces to defend critical infrastructure against attacks and sabotage across Norway, Iceland and the Danish straits.The UK and its Nato allies have become increasingly concerned about the risk Moscow poses to underwater cables and pipelines, amid heightened tensions following the invasion of Ukraine.There has been a 30% rise in Russian submarines in UK waters over the past two years, according to the MoD.The defence ministry has said Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is now back to the same levels as the Cold War era.More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick Johnson,Bruce ThainandImogen JamesPA MediaPaul Dacre started giving evidence on Tuesday, and will return to the High Court on WednesdayFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has told the High Court he \"utterly refutes\" the \"preposterous\" allegations of unlawful newsgathering at the paper. Seven people, including Prince Harry and Sir Elton John, are suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday - for \"grave breaches of privacy\".  Dacre is the current editor-in-chief of DMG Media Ltd, the holding company of ANL, which denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering.He told the court he was \"angry and upset\" for his staff at the newspapers as the allegations had \"cast a dark shadow over their lives for the past three years\".On Tuesday Dacre was back in court, facing similar questions from the same barrister, David Sherborne, who is representing the seven claimants. Dacre told the trial that he \"wasn't aware\" of the extent of the paper's use of private investigators - who he referred to as \"inquiry agents\" - until around 2007 when he \"brought the shutters down\".Sherborne asked Dacre whether his involvement in the case \"is motivated by a desire to protect your legacy\" rather than getting a fair outcome. Dacre admitted wanting to clear his name, but also said he cared about the \"honest and dedicated\" staff at the paper.Regarding allegations that hacking and tapping phones was \"habitual and widespread\" at the Daily Mail, Dacre said: \"I utterly reject this. Such blatant illegality would not, I believe, have been countenanced at any level on the paper I edited.\"He added that he is sure if he was told there was evidence a journalist or agent had blagged information, he would \"have been pretty furious\". The \"sometimes preposterous allegations\" have \"in the small hours of the night – reduced me to rage\" he wrote in his witness statement, adding that they have had a \"deeply upsetting and, in some instances, traumatic impact\" on past and present Daily Mail staff. Another of the claimants, Baroness Lawrence, is the mother of the murdered black schoolboy Stephen Lawrence. When Stephen was murdered, the Daily Mail campaigned on her behalf.In her claim, Lawrence alleges that ANL targeted her with hidden electronic surveillance, tapped her phone and monitored her bank account.Dacre told the court on Tuesday that \"my heart bleeds for Doreen Lawrence\"In his statement he added Lawrence's claims in relation to the campaign \"are especially bewildering and bitterly wounding to me personally.\"At times, the atmosphere between Sherborne and Dacre was combative. At one stage, Sherborne suggested \"you choose to remember the things that might be helpful, and deliberately forget the things that might be unhelpful\".Right at the end of the day, Mr Justice Nicklin scolded Sherborne and said he was treating his questioning like a public inquiry. \"I don't consider the large bulk of questions to have any real relevance to the issues I have to decide,\" he added.Dacre will return to the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday to continue giving evidence. The trial before Mr Justice Nicklin is due to conclude in March. A written judgment is expected to be issued at a later date.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoGeorge TorrDerbyDerbyshire PoliceIzabela Zablocka was murdered and her body was cut in two by her partner, who then buried her in the back gardenPolish TV journalist Rafal Zalewski knew Anna Podedworna was hiding something when he travelled to interview her in Derby. Prosecutors commended him and his work - calling it the \"tipping point\" that led to Podedworna emailing Derbyshire Police telling them where to find the body of her partner Izabela Zablocka. Speaking to the BBC, Zalewski said: \"She was very surprised and nervous during that conversation.\"Rafel ZalewskiProsecutors involved in the case of Izabela Zablocka's murder said Rafel Zalewski's doorstep interview of Anna Podedworna was pivotal to her confessing her crimes Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find distressingZalewski, who works as a reporter for Polsat - one of the most watched TV channels in Poland - received correspondence from Izabela's daughter, Kasia, asking him to look into her disappearance. He flew to Derby to challenge Podedworna on the doorstep of her Boyer Street home for their social affairs programme Interwencja. Despite knowing exactly where Izabela was, she denied any knowledge of her whereabouts. But Zalewski said something was amiss. He felt she was not telling the truth.\"[She was the] person from the very beginning who was pointed out by Izabela's family as someone who might be linked and have knowledge relating to the mysterious disappearance,\" he said.\"She was very surprised and nervous during that conversation.\"Rafal ZalewskiZalewski spent every day at the trial at Derby Crown CourtAfter that doorstep interview, Podedworna knew her time was up. The prosecution said the mounting pressure caused her to crack - 15 years on.Following the interaction with Zalewski, she emailed Derbyshire Police about Izabela on 15 May 2025.At first, the police had no idea what it was all about as Podedworna's email had come completely out of the blue.The police emailed the defendant back asking her for further details.Over the days that followed there was an exchange of emails between her and the force.It culminated in the defendant emailing detectives on 24 May, informing them they would find Izabela buried in the back garden of a house in Princes Street, Normanton.Derbyshire PoliceIzabela's daughter Kasia was still living in Poland when her mother went missing and contacted Zalewski for help as an adultLater that same day, the defendant attended Pear Tree police station in Derby and admitted she had killed Izabela.But she claimed Izabela had died by \"accident\" during a violent confrontation between them, and that during this, she had done nothing more than defend herself. But the jury rejected that defence when she took to the witness stand.Speaking about his interaction with Podedworna, Zalewski said the killer had told Izabela's family \"so many lies\" to them.\"I knew she could be hiding something, that she might know something more than she's not telling us,\" he said. \"This was further confirmed by how nervous she appeared to be when I showed up on her doorstep. \"We know now that right after that conversation with me, she went to the police and revealed where Izabela's remains were hidden. Now we know how Izabela got treated after her death, it's simply something monstrous and macabre.\"Derbyshire PolicePodedworna was convicted of murder by a jury on TuesdayZalewski said the case itself was high-profile, both in Poland and with Polish nationals living in the UK. \"When we walk the streets of Derby, where we've been now for over a week, people approach us every other moment and ask us about this case - what else we know, when will the prosecution take place.\"I think it will get even bigger when we hear the scale of the sentencing,\" he said.After the verdict, Det Insp Kane Martin said: \"The roles that Kasia and Mr Zalewski played in this case cannot and should not be underestimated.\"It is their actions which pushed Anna Podedworna to finally contact the police and tell us where we would find Izabela's body and where we discovered it.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoImogen JamesRoyal Family 'have not been transparent' over Epstein questions, US congressman saysAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing growing pressure from US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify in the US about his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Speaking to the BBC, Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna said the Royal Family had \"not been transparent\", while Democrat Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez said King Charles III \"should direct his brother\" to go to the US to answer questions. Earlier on Tuesday, the King said the Royal Family were \"ready to support\" police in their inquiries. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability.In the King's first intervention in the latest round of revelations in the Epstein scandal, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said if they were approached by the police, they stood \"ready to support them\" in their investigation. It added the King had \"made clear...his profound concern\" over allegations against his brother, and the King and Queen's \"thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse\".Thames Valley Police announced on Tuesday it was assessing a complaint by anti-monarchy group Republic over the alleged sharing of confidential material by  Andrew with Epstein.The former prince appears to have knowingly shared confidential information with  Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011, according to material in the latest release of files seen by the BBC.Andrew has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.Police assessing claims about Andrew sharing confidential trade detailsEpstein emails: So-called 'shady financier' was Andrew's 'trusted money man'ReutersThe King is now facing pressure to tell his brother to go to the US to testify to lawmakers When asked by the BBC if the former prince should go to the US, Khanna said that would be \"appropriate\". The Congressman, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, also said the Royal Family should \"come clean\" and lay out what they knew and what \"action they're going to take\". \"They have a large wealth, they should probably be compensating these survivors for the horrors that have taken place,\" he added. Khanna said the Royal Family were \"finally\" asking for an investigation, and that \"these women have been denied justice\". It comes a day after Khanna told journalists this was the \"most vulnerable\" the British monarchy had been, and said stripping Andrew of a title was not enough. \"The King has to answer what he knew,\" he said.The former prince has also moved out of his Windsor home and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez, who is on House Oversight Committee, called for more transparency from Andrew. Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, she urged the King to tell his brother to \"answer questions here at the Oversight Committee\". \"You cannot say 'I am protected because I'm no longer in the jurisdiction of the United States, so I cannot be held liable',\" Fernandez argued.She also called for an inquiry in England. She said Andrew \"was there, he knows who else was in the room with him. Who else was at those locations where these attacks took place?\"Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, piled on the pressure earlier on Tuesday, telling journalists: \"I think he [Andrew] should show up in front of our Congress and answer questions.\"Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer agreed. The latest emails released by the US Department of Justice reveal there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.The former prince cannot be forced by a subpoena to go to the US, which has caused a lot of frustration. Last autumn, Democrats in Congress set a November deadline for the former prince to testify about what he knew about Epstein, but he gave no response.Since the release of three million more documents related to Epstein, there has been growing pressure on Andrew, with claims a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with him.Photographs appearing to show him kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground, both fully dressed, were also included in the latest batch of files.Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.",

    "body": "Amorim sacked by Man Utd after 14 months in chargeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Amorim was appointed Manchester United manager in November 2024ByChief football news reporterBySimon StoneChief football news reporter and Emily SalleyBBC Sport journalistManchester United have sacked manager Ruben Amorim, with the club planning to appoint a caretaker manager for the remainder of the season.Former midfielder Darren Fletcher will take charge for Wednesday's Premier League game against Burnley.The Scot will remain in place until a caretaker is appointed for the rest of the campaign, with the club planning to name a permanent successor for Amorim in the summer. On Friday Amorim hinted that his relationship with club officials was strained - suggesting he would not be fully backed in the transfer market.And following the 1-1 draw with Leeds on Sunday, the Portuguese aimed another dig at senior United figures, stating he wanted to work as a manager \"not the coach\" and was ready to leave when his contract expired in 18 months' time.Less than 24 hours later, the club announced Amorim had \"departed his role as head coach of Manchester United\" after 14 months in charge.\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" United said.\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"Amorim's coaching team have also left United.In October, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said on The Business podcast, external Amorim would be given three years to \"demonstrate he is a great coach\" and that the club needed to be \"patient\".But sources have told BBC Sport that the club now feels there has not been sufficient evidence of evolution or progress this season under Amorim.The 40-year-old was appointed in November 2024 after United agreed to pay Portuguese club Sporting 11m euros (£9.25m) to trigger a release clause in his contract.Amorim won 25 of his 63 games in charge of the Red Devils, while his 14-month stint is the shortest reign of a permanent manager at United since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.Former United midfielder Fletcher is currently the under-18s head coach and was the club's technical director between 2021 and 2024, but he has never held a senior coaching position.The 41-year-old former Scotland international played for United between 2002 and 2015, winning five Premier League titles along with the 2007-08 Champions League.He is expected to hold United's news conference on Tuesday before their game against Burnley at Turf Moor the following day.'The situation had become untenable' - analysisWhen Manchester United appointed Amorim as head coach - note the title - they viewed it as a progressive decision, bringing in someone who would work in a modern structure and develop as he went along.Amorim had a good relationship with the players but despite multiple times, in private and public, saying his tactics would evolve from the 3-4-3 formation he used at Sporting, it never happened, much to the disappointment of those who ran the club.This was brought into sharp focus on 30 December when, four days after changing to a back four for the first time in the 1-0 win over Newcastle, he reverted to a three-man defence against Wolves, moving Patrick Dorgu from a right-sided attacking role, where he had been so effective on Boxing Day, to left wing-back.Fans were stunned and dismayed in equal measure.By that point, United had already tried to persuade long-term target Antoine Semenyo to join them from Bournemouth by telling him he would play on the left wing. This was a clear sign the club viewed the future as being something different to a 3-4-3 formation, given they had already spent in excess of £200m on attacking players.It is no surprise therefore that the formation against Wolves and the subsequent result - a 1-1 draw against a side who previously had collected just two points all season and which led to the team being booed off - was viewed extremely negatively internally at Old Trafford. It was another massive backwards step in Amorim's relationship with his bosses, and his continued criticism just heightened that situation.Already distinctly unimpressed by Amorim's brutal dismissal of academy players - he never watched a single age-group game - and criticism of senior members of the United squad, it left the 40-year-old in an extremely delicate position heading into the Leeds game.His interaction with the media on Friday included a thinly disguised admission there were splits behind the scenes. And things erupted after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Elland Road when Amorim launched his final broadside, in his very last answer, which included the statement that he \"would not quit\".That, effectively, meant United had to either back Amorim or sack him. Amorim wanted to be left alone to do his job, free from the unwanted influence of director of footall Jason Wilcox.But what Amorim felt was interference, United believed was normal feedback which had been repeatedly resisted.The situation had become untenable. United are sixth, in line with pre-season expectations and with a squad many, both inside Old Trafford and out, could deliver much better results than they have been getting with a few simple tactical tweaks.Amorim's rocky 14-month reignMedia caption, 'I came here to be the manager, not to be the coach' - Amorim on future at UnitedIn January 2024, Amorim described his team as \"maybe the worst\" in the 147-year history of the club.They ended last season 15th in the Premier League - United's lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated from Division One in 1974.United did reach the Europa League final in May but lost 1-0 against Tottenham and subsequently missed out on a place in Europe for the first time since 2014-15.Amorim spent £216m on new signings over the summer with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens among those added to the squad.In the Premier League, Amorim had the worst win ratio (32%), the worst goals conceded per game ratio (1.53) and the lowest clean sheet ratio (15%) of any Manchester United manager.The club will start their FA Cup campaign in the third round against Brighton on Sunday - August's penalty shootout defeat at League Two Grimsby in the second round of the Carabao Cup stands out as a low point of Amorim's reign.Amorim's stats as Man Utd bossTaking charge of 47 top-flight games from 24 November 2024, he won 15, drew 13 and lost 19, giving him a win ratio of 31.9% - the lowest of any permanent Manchester United manager in the Premier League.When taking all competitions into account in the Premier League era, only Ralf Rangnick has a lower win ratio than Amorim, although there is little in it - 37.9% compared with 38.1%.Netting 66 times in those 47 games, Amorim had the second-lowest goals per game ratio (1.4) as Manchester United chief in the Premier League -  just behind Rangnick, whose sides averaged 1.38 per game with 33 in 24 matches.The story defensively was no better, with 72 giving him the worst goals conceded per game ratio (1.53) and worst clean sheets ratio (seven - 14.9%).Among ever-present Premier League sides since Amorim's first game, only three sides have won fewer points than Manchester United's 58 - Tottenham with 46, West Ham with 45 and Wolves with 39.Under Amorim, United conceded the fourth-most goals in the Premier League with 72. Only West Ham (84), Wolves (81) and Brighton (70) shipped more.In 45 of Amorim's 47 Premier League games, he started with a three-man defence. Only Crystal Palace named more starting line-ups in this manner from 24 November 2024 onwards, with 46.Timeline of Amorim's tenure1 November 2024 - Manchester United appoint Ruben Amorim as their new head coach11 November 2024 - Amorim officially begins job after leaving Sporting19 January 2025 - Amorim describes his team as \"maybe the worst\" in the 147-year history of the club17 April 2025 - Manchester United stage a staggering comeback, scoring twice in the final minute of extra time, to recover from 4-2 down against Lyon and reach the Europa League final21 May 2025 - Manchester United lose Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham25 May 2025 - Manchester United suffer their worst-ever Premier League season, finishing 15th with 42 pointsJune - August 2025 - United spend more than £200m on new signings, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha among those to arrive27 August 2025 - Manchester United suffer a humiliating Carabao Cup exit against League Two Grimsby8 October 2025 - Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe says Amorim needs three years to prove he is a \"great\" coach24 November 2025 - Ten-man Everton hold on for a rare Old Trafford victory despite losing Idrissa Gueye after just 13 minutes30 December 2025 - Manchester United fail to beat rock-bottom Wolves, who leave Old Trafford with only their third point of the season2 January 2026 - Amorim hints that his relationship with club officials is strained as January transfer window opens4 January 2026 - Amorim states he wants to work as a manager \"not the coach\" and is ready to leave when his contract expires in 18 months' time, following 1-1 draw at promoted Leeds United5 January 2026 - Amorim leaves Manchester United'Bring back Solskjaer' - your viewsDavid: He was asking for his P45 by making those comments. It always spells the end.Brian: Absolutely stupid. What they going to do now? Bring a yes man in that they can walk all over, and let the players do what they want, as they have done ever since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down?Salley: He should have been sacked last season. Bring back Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.Adam: So disappointed! After the miserable era under Erik ten Hag, Amorim initially felt like a breath of fresh air with his passion and ideas for bringing an identity back. However, his own ego in his own playing style has led to him making rash statements and line-up choices. You would have thought the toxicity would have been removed with the new leadership, transfers and coach. Obviously there is still a toxic core somewhere in Manchester United.Jonathon: Yes, we should have sacked him. But, my word, it's shambles of a club right now.Ben: Absolute joke. Whatever we do going forward, the board will always rule. No changes.Dylan: You can't argue with your boss and not expect to get into any type of trouble. Losing against Spurs in the Europa League final should've pushed him out!Ethan: It's the wrong decision. Last season we struggled under Ten Hag but seemingly thrived under Amorim, especially in Europe.Matthew: Like anyone else in a job, if we went to the media and started moaning about our managers and the company we work for, I would expect to get sacked.Pat: Huge mistake. Rarely does a manager of this quality and class come along and when they do, the 'senior management' should be able to recognise what they have and back him by giving him the time he needs. Maybe it says more about their management abilities than his. Genuinely gutted.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSimon JonesSouth EastGetty ImagesThe government said the new powers will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangsNew powers allowing mobile phones to be seized from illegal migrants without arresting them have come into force. The government said it will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangs organising small boat crossings to the UK.The Home Office said seizures will begin on Monday at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, with technology on site ready to download intelligence from devices.Officers will be able to demand that migrants remove their coats to search for phones and also check their mouths for SIM cards.The National Crime Agency said the information collected could speed up investigations into smuggling gangs.Border security minister Alex Norris said: \"We promised to restore order and control to our borders, which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.\"That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.\"The Refugee Council said it was important that the new powers were used proportionately. It said phones were a lifeline for vulnerable people who needed to remain in contact with their families.Mike Tapp, minister for migration and citizenship, said seized phones could later be returned but that would \"depend on the individual circumstances... what's found on that phone. That's for the guys on the ground to make that operational decision.\"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"If people have devices... that could hold intelligence, then we are right to be able to seize that. But that  doesn't take away compassion.\" The new law also introduces offences that could leave perpetrators facing up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK.Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could face five years in prison.Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, said more than 4,000 disruptions against smuggling gangs had taken place since his unit was set up, including seizing cash and convicting key players.He said Monday marked a \"key moment\" to go further with extra tools to crack down on smugglers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also announced plans for \"significant changes\" to the asylum system to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.A total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour had confined itself to \"cosmetic tweaks\" and that there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel.He said the Conservatives would leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something Labour has rejected in favour of reforming the treaty.\"With more than 41,000 people arriving in 2025, the government needs to get a proper grip on the situation,\" he added.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterPA MediaJunk food adverts are banned on television and online starting on Monday as part of a drive to tackle childhood obesity.  The UK-wide ban stops food and drinks high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) being advertised on TV before 21:00 and at any time online.It applies to products considered to be the biggest drivers of childhood obesity, including soft drinks, chocolates and sweets, pizzas and ice creams.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said it is committed to helping people eat healthily and has been voluntarily abiding by the new restrictions since October.As well as more obviously unhealthy foods, the ban also covers some breakfast cereals and porridges, sweetened bread products, and main meals and sandwiches.Decisions over which products fall under the ban are based on a scoring tool, balancing their nutrient levels against whether they are high in saturated fat, salt, or sugar.Plain oats and most porridge, muesli and granola are not banned under the crackdown, but some versions with added sugar, chocolate or syrup could be affected.Firms can still promote healthier versions of banned products, which the government hopes will lead to food makers developing healthier recipes.Josh Tilley, brand strategy director at marketing agency Initials CX, said companies will still be allowed to advertise their brand in general, but not specific products.Adverts featuring \"things like the PepsiCo logo or the McDonald's arches\" will not be banned he said, meaning that larger companies may be less affected by the new restrictions. Smaller companies \"can't necessarily afford those bigger brand campaigns\", Tilley said. Their adverts are based on \"educating people\" about specific products, \"and they're no longer going to be able to do that\".The ban only covers adverts in which unhealthy products can be seen by viewers, meaning fast-food firms will still be able to advertise using their brand name.Previously, HFSS food and drink adverts were banned on any platform where more than a quarter of the audience was under 16.Firms that do not comply with the new rules risk action by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).NHS data shows almost one in 10 (9.2%) reception-aged children are now living with obesity, while one in five children have tooth decay by the age of five.It is estimated obesity costs the NHS more than £11bn every year.Evidence shows children's exposure to ads for unhealthy food can influence what they eat from a young age, in turn putting them at greater risk of becoming overweight or obese.The government estimates the ad ban will prevent around 20,000 cases of childhood obesity.Katherine Brown, professor of behaviour change in health at the University of Hertfordshire, said the ban was \"long overdue and a move in the right direction\".She said: \"Children are highly susceptible to aggressive marketing of unhealthy foods and exposure to them puts them at greater risk of developing obesity and associated chronic diseases.\"Ms Brown called for the government to make nutritious options \"more affordable, accessible and appealing\".The FDF said manufacturers are \"committed to working in partnership with the government and others to help people make healthier choices\".It added: \"Investing in developing healthier products has been a key priority for food and drink manufacturers for many years and as a result, our members' products now have a third of the salt and sugar and a quarter of the calories than they did ten years ago.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "14 minutes agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandKathryn ArmstrongTen people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended.The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting.Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed.They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that Mrs Macron \"is in fact a man\".A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoHelena Wilkinson,News correspondentandCurtis Lancaster,South of EnglandThe Duke of Marlborough arrived at court on Monday morningThe Duke of Marlborough has denied strangling his estranged wife on three occasions in an 18-month period.Charles James Spencer-Churchill, 70, is accused of striking Edla Marlborough several times before placing his hands around her neck and squeezing them together before letting go on 13 November 2022.High Wycombe Magistrates' Court heard that on 23 April 2023 the duke allegedly grabbed her hair, before hitting her with a closed fist and then grabbing her neck. On 29 January 2024 he is accused of grabbing her \"tightly around the neck\".He indicated he would plead not guilty to three counts of intentional strangulation and was released on bail to appear at Oxford Crown Court on 5 February.Getty ImagesThe duke married Edla Griffiths, his second wife, in 2002 but they separated in 2024The court was told the 2022 incident occurred following an argument in the garden of their home.The second accusation describes Edla Marlborough running into a laundry room before being attacked.Prosecutors said on the occasion in 2024, the duke, who gave his address as Blenheim Palace, grabbed her around the neck before throwing her on a bed.The twice-married aristocrat, formerly known as the Marquess of Blandford, married his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, in 2002.They are said to have met while she was living in Chelsea and working on her art, and they wed after dating for seven years.The pair are thought to have separated in 2024.He inherited his dukedom in 2014, following the death of his father, the 11th Duke of Marlborough.He is a first cousin, three times removed, of Sir Winston Churchill and a distant relative of the late Princess Diana through the Spencer family.His ancestral family home is Blenheim Palace in Woodstock – Sir Winston's birthplace - which is owned and managed by Blenheim Palace Heritage Foundation.The foundation said, in a previous statement, it was \"unable to comment on the charges, which relate to the duke's personal conduct and private life, and which are subject to live, criminal proceedings\".It added: \"The foundation is not owned or managed by the Duke of Marlborough, but by independent entities run by boards of trustees.\"Blenheim PalaceFormer Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim PalaceRelated storiesRelated link",

    "body": "Just nowChris MasonPolitical editorWatch: ‘Only Greenland should decide its future’Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded to Trump's latest comments by saying \"that's enough now\" and described the notion of US control over the island as a \"fantasy\".Meanwhile, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had said \"the US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom\".Asked whether he would also say to President Trump \"hands off Greenland\", Sir Keir's response was definitive, when so often in diplomacy answers are caveated and nuanced.\"Yes,\" he replied. \"Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must decide the future of Greenland and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark. \"And Denmark is a close ally in Europe, is a Nato ally and it is very important that the future of Greenland is for the Kingdom of Denmark and for Greenland themselves and only for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.\"The prime minister's language on the legality or otherwise of America's seizing of the Venezuelan President and his wife in recent days was considerably less definitive.\"The US will have to justify the action it has taken,\" Sir Keir said, adding that \"we will always defend the international rule of law\".But he repeatedly ducked offering a straight answer as to whether the US had acted within international law.\"There was an illegitimate president who has now been removed, and I don't think anybody is really shedding any tears about that,\" he said, calling for \"a peaceful transition to democracy\" as soon as possible.The US military action has been criticised by some Labour MPs, as well as the leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and the SNP, who have called on the PM to condemn the move as a breach of international law.On Sunday, Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, became the most senior Labour MP so far to do so.She told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the US strikes were \"not a legal action\" and she \"cannot think of anything that could be a proper justification\".Describing the situation as \"international anarchy\", she warned it risked emboldening Russia and China.A handful of Labour MPs - mostly on the left of the party - have publicly condemned the US action for breaking international law so far.However, more could criticise the UK's response in the House of Commons later, when the foreign secretary is expected to give a statement on the developments in Venezuela.The UN Security Council, of which the UK is a permanent member, is due to meet later to discuss the US operation.Venezuela's left-wing president and his wife Cilia Flores were flown out of Caracas in a military operation in conjunction with US law enforcement.They have since been charged with weapon and drug offences in New York, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US, and are expected to appear in court later.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power.",

You were loved by so many people, and we will all miss you forever.\"A loving husband, father, son, brother and the best grandad anybody could ever wish for. Sleep tight, we love you, we miss you.\"Mr Ratcliffe's son, in a Facebook post, thanked the RNLI, HM coastguards and the emergency services who had done \"all they could\" and worked tirelessly and relentlessly in awful weather conditions.\"Bye Dad, I miss you and I will never forget the true hero and role model you were,\" he wrote.Police said both families were being supported by specially trained officers.BBC/Joe BiltonThe police said officers were continuing to search for Grace KeelingAt 15:10 GMT on Friday, the coastguard responded to reports of \"a number of people in difficulty\" in the water.What followed was a huge search and rescue operation involving about 100 emergency workers, a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington, Skegness and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.The coastguard stood down their search at 16:00 on Saturday afternoon.The RNLI thanked members of the public who they said had \"assisted and supported\" the emergency services.\"This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families, friends and all those impacted,\" they said in a statement on Sunday.BBC/Becki BowdenFloral tributes have been placed close to the scene on the promenadePaul Whitehead, owner of Castle Cafe on the promenade said he had handed three minutes of CCTV footage taken from the front of the cafe over to the police.Mr Whitehead said several people ran across to help including two members of his staff. He said a lifebelt at the foot of the towers on the seafront was thrown into the sea to help the young woman but the undertow took her away.\"It's just an accident,\" he said, \"a tragic accident, and it has affected the town deeply.\"Mr Whitehead said he had lit three candles in St Matthew's Methodist church on Sunday, one for each of the three victims.Services took place at the church earlier to allow people to reflect on what had happened. People have also placed flowers on the promenade.  Janice Holgate, who travelled from Hull, said it had been \"absolutely devastating\" to hear what had happened.\"I had to pay my respects just to let the families know that people are thinking about them,\" she said.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "A bulky bluefin tuna made a splash at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market on Monday morning, fetching a record 510.3 million yen ($3.2m; £2.4m) at the market's first auction of the year.The winning bid for the 243kg fish came from Kiyomura Corp, the operator of popular sushi chain Sushi Zanmai, which has outlets across the country and abroad.\"The year's first tuna brings good luck,\" said Kiyoshi Kimura, the company's president and a familiar figure at the annual new year's auction, Kyodo reported.Mr Kimura, who has been dubbed the Tuna King, is known to bid high for bluefin tuna at new year's auctions. The entrepreneur told reporters after the auction that he was \"surprised at the price\", AFP reported.\"I'd thought we would be able to buy a little cheaper, but the price soared before you knew it,\" he said.Mr Kimura paid 56.5 million yen for a bluefin tuna in 2012 and 155 million yen in 2013 - setting record prices both times.In 2019 he bought a bluefin tuna with 333.6 million yen ($2.1m; £1.6m) - another historic price.Despite telling reporters at the time that he thought he \"did too much\", however, Mr Kimura has now gone on to break his own record again.The first auction at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market typically sees fish selling for exorbitant prices.Last year, the first tuna at the auction was bought for 207 million yen by Onodera Group, another food company that owns a sushi chain. It said that the fish would be served at its restaurants across the country.The frenetic energy at fish markets during such pre-dawn auctions has become a popular tourist attraction in Tokyo. Monday's auction, which started at around 05:00 local time (20:00 GMT), was no exception.The million-dollar tuna was sliced up for customers at Kimura's sushi restaurants shortly after it was auctioned off.\"I feel like I've begun the year in a good way after eating something so auspicious as the year starts,\" one of the customers at Mr Kimura's restaurant told AFP.",

    "body": "9 minutes agoGeorge Herd,BBC Wales, Llandudno Magistrates' CourtandOliver Slow,BBC WalesThis is the moment when Jonathan Carley was spotted wearing the uniform and medals of a high-ranking navy officerA man has been fined £500 after admitting to dressing as a navy admiral without permission at a Remembrance Sunday event.Jonathan Carley, 65, was charged with wearing uniform or dress bearing the mark of His Majesty's Forces without permission.He was arrested at his home in north Wales after images showed him wearing the uniform of one of the Royal Navy's most senior ranks, along with a raft of medals - including a Distinguished Service Order - at a Remembrance Sunday parade in Llandudno.Appearing at Llandudno Magistrates' Court on Monday, Carley was fined £500 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £200 surcharge. PA MediaJonathan Carley, 65, appeared at Llandudno Magistrates' Court on MondayHe was seen wearing the epaulettes and sleeve lace of a Rear Admiral, a two-star position that is one of the highest ranks in the Royal Navy, at the event in November.Carley, from Harlech in Gwynedd, was seen walking in formation to the war memorial before a wreath was laid by another individual, and then saluted at the war memorial before marching away.Concerns were raised by serving and former service personnel.Llandudno Town Council, which organised the Remembrance event, confirmed that no-one of the senior rank had been due to attend the ceremony.He told police that the naval uniform was issued to him legitimately when he was in the cadets but he had rear admiral rings added by a tailor and he had bought medals online.James Neary, prosecuting, said at the \"well attended\" service, Carley wore medals including for service in Iraq and Syria and approached organisers to introduce himself.\"The defendant was allowed to lay a wreath. He did so, he saluted and stood among other dignitaries,\" Neary said. Hundreds of people were on the seafront in Llandudno to mark Remembrance SundayCarley's photograph later went viral on social media and when he was arrested on 14 November, he told police: \"I've been expecting you.\"In interview, he told police he had wanted a sense of \"belonging and affirmation\".Carley faced a single charge of being a person not serving in HM military forces, wearing without His Majesty's permission a uniform and dress bearing the regimental or other distinctive mark of the military force, namely The Royal Navy.The court was told that is an offence under the Uniforms Act, which dates back to 1894.More top stories",

Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.It comes as officials in Switzerland said on Sunday that they had identified all 40 victims of the New Year's Day fire in a bar in Crans-Montana.Charlotte, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College, a private school in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London.In the statement on Facebook, Charlotte's family wrote: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"Details regarding the funeral arrangements will follow shortly. It is most likely on Thursday in Paris.\"Thank you for all your support those last few days.\"According to the Crans-Montana resort website, Charlotte had been working as a babysitter in the area.Yvette Cooper said  it was \"terrible news\" that Charlotte had been identified as one of victims of the fire.\"My thoughts are with all her family and friends after this devastating loss,\" she wrote on X.After the blaze, Immanuel College had said it was \"praying for a miracle\".Swiss President Guy Parmelin has called the fire \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.The bar that was the scene of the fire, Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana, was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating New Year's Day in the early hours of Thursday when the blaze began in the basement area.Prosecutors say that, according to initial investigations, the likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried \"too close to the ceiling\".An investigation into the causes of the blaze will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.On Sunday, Valais cantonal police said all victims had been identified and were aged between 14 and 39 years old.The victims came from seven countries - though several held multiple nationalities.Swiss police said one of those victims identified was a 15-year-old who held triple citizenship with France, Israel and the UK. Other nationalities include Portuguese, Romanian, Belgian, French, Italian and Swiss.Another 35 people who were injured in the fire have been transferred to specialist burns units outside Switzerland as the country struggles to cope with the scale of the tragedy.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "5 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesThe US carried out a number of air strikes against targets in Venezuela as an elite military unit made its way to Nicolás Maduro's compound The Cuban government has said 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It said the dead were members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies, with two days of national mourning declared.A short statement did not elaborate on the role of the Cubans in Venezuela, but the two governments are long-standing allies, with Cuba providing security support in exchange for oil.Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said they had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. An official government statement read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombings on the facilities.\"Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed during the US raid on Maduro's compound in Caracas on Saturday.  The New York Times, citing an unnamed Venezuelan official, reported on Sunday that the death toll stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the capture of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"Watch: Venezuela is 'a mess' and Cuba is 'ready to fall', says TrumpOn Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor Joe Biden easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

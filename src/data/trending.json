    "body": "4 hours agoThe Observer leads with the headline \"War and peace\" in Ukraine, filling their front page with a striking image of a woman carrying a Christmas tree and walking past the rubble of a bombed-out building. A sub-headline updates readers with the latest that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to meet with Donald Trump on Sunday in Florida discuss a new 20-point peace plan agreed by American and Ukrainian envoys.Closer to home, Sir Keir Starmer has welcomed the arrival of British-Egyptian writer and pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah in the UK, the Sunday Telegraph reports. The paper says the prime minister is \"delighted\" that Abdel Fattah has been reunited with his loved ones following his years in jail, including on charges of spreading fake news. But the paper points out that Conservative Robert Jenrick said it was an error of judgement to welcome the arrival of \"the awful extremist\".  Elsewhere, a photo of Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay's wedding is front and centre after the pair got hitched at Bath Abbey.\"Abbey ever after\" is the Sunday Times' take on the Peaty-Ramsay wedding. Alongside, the paper reports that the prime minister nominated a former adviser for peerage despite knowing he had once campaigned for a councillor who had been charged with child sex offences. Matthew Doyle, who was the Downing Street director of communications, left his role in March.Staying with the PM, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned Sir Keir is \"in trouble\" and could face a leadership challenge if Labour perform poorly in next year's May elections, according to the Sunday Express. Badenoch added that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has only kept her job because if she is ousted the prime minister will also \"have to go\", the paper says.In royal news, the Mail on Sunday says Prince William is facing backlash from neighbours over a \"ring of steel\" security zone around his family's new home in Windsor. The paper reports locals are feeling \"ambushed\" into accepting the security measures that include fencing with CCTV cameras and numerous no-entry. The paper says the measures have \"cut a gouge\" through Windsor Great Park.A poll conducted by the Sunday Mirror reveals some 64% of Britons are in favour of an Australian-style social media ban for under-16s. The paper quotes Labour MP Joani Reid, who is also chairwoman of the Children's Online Safety Group, who says \"the public is well ahead of the political debate\".In a \"touching tribute\" at Liverpool's Anfield stadium, the late footballer Diogo Jota's young sons joined their dad's teammates and family on the field as mascots before Saturday's match against Wolves. It was the first meeting between Jota's two former teams since his death. The headline \"They'll never walk alone\" is a reference to the club's famous anthem which is always played prior to kick-off.Finally, the Sun leads with the news that ice skating legends Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean will be given a damehood and knighthood in the King's New Year Honours, to be officially announced this week. The pair won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics and continued to delight fans after they retired as judges, trainers and performers on ITV show Dancing on Ice.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'4 hours agoPallab GhoshKPNO/NOIRLabA lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the UniverseThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space.An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\".The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.NASA/ESAThese are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speedWhat is dark energy?Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity.Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\".Eventually, some astronomers thought the expansion would slow down under the force of gravity and then slowly collapse in on itself, something they called the Big Crunch.Tentative results this year now support this theory.The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lehav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project.\"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says.Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly.\"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together.\"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility.\"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee.Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\"The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy.But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.\"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley LabA cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a timeSince the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial.Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts.Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director.\"Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?\" he says. \"Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one.\"Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?\"",

    "body": "The Treasury is set to insure the Bayeux Tapestry against damage for an estimated £800m while it is on loan to the British Museum next year.The 70m-long embroidery depicting the Battle of Hastings in 1066 will travel from France to London as part of a deal between the two nations' governments.The artefact's transit and its time in storage and on display will be covered under the Government Indemnity Scheme (GIS). Indemnity insurance covers situations like loss or damage.A Treasury spokesperson said that, without the long-standing scheme, \"public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost effective\".There are concerns about the move, as some French art experts have suggested the nearly 1,000-year-old work was in far too a delicate state to be transported - something French officials have denied.It is understood the Treasury has received an initial valuation for covering the Bayeux Tapestry that has been provisionally approved. The loan will not be formally confirmed until it receives the final valuation.That final valuation is estimated to be around £800m, according to the Financial Times, citing unnamed officials. The Treasury did not dispute this figure when approached by the BBC.The Bayeux Tapestry will be displayed in the Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery of the British Museum from next September until July 2027 while its current home, the Bayeux Museum, undergoes renovations. Comprising 58 scenes, 626 characters and 202 horses, the huge masterpiece charts a contested time in Anglo-French relations when William The Conqueror took the English throne from Harold Godwinson, becoming the first Norman king of England.The government's indemnity scheme allows art and cultural objects to be shown publicly in the UK which \"might not have been otherwise because the cost of insurance would have been too high\".  The scheme - first set up in 1980 - has facilitated numerous high-value loans,  including Vincent van Gogh's 1888 work The Bedroom to the National Gallery. The scheme is estimated to save museums and galleries around £81m a year when compared to the cost of taking out commercial insurance.In exchange for the Bayeux Tapestry, the British Museum will loan items to France, including the 7th Century Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered at the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk and the 12th Century Lewis chess pieces.",

    "body": "The head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.In his letter, Richard Grenell, said the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members, and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board. Grenell, the Trump Kennedy Center president, wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show \"is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name on the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanThe UK is to impose visa restrictions against people arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo after its government failed to agree to measures allowing the return of illegal migrants and foreign national offenders. Ministers say the DRC has not made changes required under the toughening up of the UK's asylum rules announced in November.Fast-track visa processes will no longer apply to people from the country, while the Home Office said VIPs and politicians would no longer get preferential treatment when coming to the UK.Meanwhile, the Home Office said Angola and Namibia had agreed to step up efforts to take back their citizens, having been threatened with sanctions alongside the DRC.A government source said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood would not hesitate to ban visas for other countries refusing to take citizens back.The Home Office said Angola and Namibia agreeing to improve their processes marked the \"first delivery success from last month's asylum reforms\".The government had warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo if their governments did not rapidly improve co-operation on removals.A Home Office source said the agreements could see thousands of people removed and deported.Under the government's changes to the UK's asylum system, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Announcing the changes last month, Mahmood had warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto.It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".It said there had been some engagement by the DRC but \"unless co-operation rapidly improves\" further measures could be imposed, including the possibility of a complete visa ban on people from the country coming to the UK.Home Secretary Mahmood said: \"We expect countries to play by the rules. If one of their citizens has no right to be here, they must take them back.\"I thank Angola and Namibia and welcome their co-operation. Now is the time for the Democratic Republic of Congo to do the right thing. Take your citizens back or lose the privilege of entering our country.\"",

    "body": "4 days agoLizzy BellaandGeorgia Levy-Collins,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesJeremiah Azu ran for Team GB in the men's 100m semi-final at the World Athletics Championships Tokyo 2025When Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi scored against Arsenal on Tuesday night, he did what he often does - point to the sky.Arsenal's Jurrien Timber - nicknamed 'Pastor Timber' by fans - followed suit when he scored in the penalty shoot-out at the end of the game. Both teams have influential players who have recently been discussing the importance of their Christian beliefs.And it's not just in football where we've seen contrasting headlines about professional athletes displaying their faith.Earlier this year, at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, GB sprinter Jeremiah Azu was warned not to wear a \"100% Jesus\" headband.But can your beliefs impact your performance - and how you are treated - in the sport you play? ReutersCrystal Palace's Marc Guehi celebrates scoring against Arsenal at Emirates StadiumSport governing bodies often have rules against displaying religious and political slogans during competition.Jeremiah wasn't formally punished for wearing his \"100% Jesus\" headband in a 400m semi-final, but World Athletics bosses said they spoke to his team about the accessory.The 24-year-old says he now backs the rules separating religion from the track, but he's glad he did it.He tells BBC Newsbeat he believes his \"strength\" comes from his faith, and he wore the headband to show that.His father is a pastor, so Jeremiah says religion has always been a part of his life.\"We read the Bible at home, we prayed at home,\" he recalls. He says his religion helps his performance in athletics. \"As a Christian you have to be disciplined,\" he says, a trait he feels transfers over to track and field.\"There's days where it's difficult to push, but I know I have to from the discipline I've got from my faith,\" he explains. Semi-pro footballers Zainab El-Mouden (left) and Jaiden Chang-Brown are both devoted to their religions  Though Jeremiah says he's never felt \"muted\" when talking about his faith, up-and-coming athletes tell Newsbeat it's not always that simple. Semi-pro footballer Zainab El-Mouden, who plays for Chesham United FC Women,  says there are challenges as a female Muslim player who wears a hijab. The garment is worn over the head as a display of modesty, but it's not always been welcomed on the football pitch.It was banned by governing body Fifa until 2014, when players were permitted to wear it for religious reasons.And just two years ago, Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina, 27, made history by becoming the first player to wear a hijab at a World Cup.Zainab, 22, says her faith means everything to her, from the way she conducts herself to the way she dresses. She says it's been a real journey to become comfortable wearing a hijab while playing football. \"Initially I hated it, I hated the way it looked on me,\" she says.\"My hijab was my biggest insecurity and then it became my biggest strength.\"Whether you want to or not, you're going see me and you're gonna watch me more than anyone else.\"Zainab feels there is still a difference in how male Muslim players are treated compared with female players. \"With a female Muslim player, they're visibly different so that's where I think the rift kind of comes in,\" she says.After growing up with no one that \"looked like\" her in football to inspire her, Zainab says she wants to be that role model for others.\"All the girls that are growing up now need that representation to play,\" she says.Does faith impact your performance in sport ?There are studies on how a positive mindset and confidence can influence your performance.Religion isn't always part of it - many athletes have rituals they \"must\" follow before a big game or race to centre themselves.  Some report that their faith forms part of preparations for a big event.A Seoul University study published in 2000, based on interviews with 180 sports people across 41 sports, identified prayer as one of seven main \"coping strategies\" those surveyed used to combat anxiety before a big event.It suggested this could have a positive effect on their performance.Semi-professional footballer Jaiden Chang-Brown, of Lingfield FC, tells Newsbeat his faith has helped him to manage his emotions in a slightly different way.\"I feel like sometimes my passion could get the better of me in the past,\" he says.\"Sometimes I would lash out at teammates.\"It's really helped just to give me peace when I'm on the pitch.\"Jaiden says his faith has helped him to improve his mindset and \"tap into that psychological side of football\" when he plays.The 21-year-old describes himself as a \"born-again Christian\" and says his religion is the most important thing in his life.\"It's bigger than football, it's bigger than everything,\" he says.\"People think it's not cool to be bold in your faith, but it is.\"You can laugh and have your giggles, but it's what I believe in.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

The mistake was only realised after the funeral service and cremation.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde blamed human error and said that the staff involved had been suspended.First reported by the Scottish Sun, the family who thought they were cremating their loved one are said to be inconsolable.The mistake also denied another family the chance to have their relative's remains for a funeral. Dr Scott Davidson, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde medical director, said: \"I would like to offer my sincere apologies to both families affected.\"We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker.\"It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time.\"We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied.\"'Deeply concerned'The £840m QEUH campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children, was hailed as a world leading facility when it opened in 2015.However, it has been dogged by infection outbreaks and concerns around the water and ventilation systems.Such issues are being investigated as part of the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry.The Scottish government said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the cremation incident.A spokesperson said: \"We wish to express our sincere condolences to the families involved with this terrible incident. \"We have been clear with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that they must fully investigate the circumstances. \"We will also carefully consider the findings of the senior inspector of burial, cremation and funeral directors into the circumstances.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoJoshua AskewSouth EastGetty ImagesContactless changes were expanded to 30 more train stations in DecemberThe expansion of contactless payments on trains has caused the price of travelling on some services to soar as they now require more expensive peak time tickets.The change allows people to pay by tapping a bank card or contactless-enabled device on readers at stations, avoiding the need to manually purchase a ticket.But Rebecca Paul, Conservative MP for Reigate, said the new rules  -  introduced to 30 more stations in the South East on 14 December - risked \"pricing passengers out of rail altogether\".Train operator Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said the changes meant many passengers would save money and insisted the process was not designed to increase revenue. The introduction of contactless payments to 30 more stations in south-east England forms part of the Department for Transport's (DfT) Project Oval.However, changes to paper ticketing time restrictions to align with Transport for London's contactless structure have meant some services that could previously be used with an off-peak ticket now require a more expensive peak ticket.'Ridiculous'The first weekday London-bound Southern service from Reigate, Surrey, that can be boarded with an off-peak day travelcard ticket now departs at 09:28, compared with 08:58 previously.But when the 08:58 train calls at Redhill just five minutes later, passengers are still able to board it with an off-peak ticket.A day travelcard that can be used at any time from the stations costs £37.10 whereas an off-peak is £20.60.There are also new restrictions on travel between 16:00 and 19:00.One member of the Reigate, Redhill and District Rail Users' Association described the situation as \"ridiculous\" and said he would cycle to Redhill to save money.Getty ImagesThe Department for Transport has defended the changesMeanwhile, Paul said a number of residents were \"understandably frustrated\" by the contactless expansion. The MP added: \"This change should make rail travel easier, not more expensive or confusing.\"The contactless rollout has also led to the cheapest super off-peak tickets being removed from some stations.Analysis by lobby group Railfuture said passengers paying by contactless would be charged up to twice as much as those using paper tickets for some journeys.This is because discounts for railcards or children cannot be registered with contactless.'More flexible travel'A GTR spokesman said: \"Peak and off-peak timing has to match with the TfL system...\"We understand how, for some people, this means fares will rise, but for many others they will fall.\"It pointed to a number of savings, such as Reigate passengers making a single journey at weekday off-peak times now paying £7.60 compared with £14.60 previously.Commuters travelling before 06:30 and returning either before 16:00 or after 19:00 now save £11.60, it added. The Department for Transport said: \"Contactless ticketing means passengers are benefiting from simpler, more flexible travel and the majority of single tickets will be the same price or even lower.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

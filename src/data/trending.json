    "body": "4 hours agoMengchen Zhang, Jack Lau and Ankur ShahBBC Global China Unit and Eye InvestigationsBBCWarning: This report contains details of physical and sexual abuse and discussion of suicide.Baobao's heart still races when she smells soil after morning rain.It takes her back to early military drills behind locked gates - and the constant fear that marked every one of her days at Lizheng Quality Education School.For six months, aged 14, she barely left the red and white building in a remote Chinese village where instructors tried to \"fix\" young people whose families considered them rebellious or problematic.Students who failed to comply were beaten so severely they could not sleep on their backs or sit down for days, she says.\"Every single moment was agonising,\" says Baobao, now 19 and speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.She says she considered suicide, and knows other students who attempted it.'Raped and beaten'A BBC Eye investigation has uncovered multiple allegations of physical abuse in the school and others in the same network, and cases of young people being abducted and taken to the institutions.Corporal punishment has been banned in China for decades, but we have collated testimony from 23 former students who say they were beaten or forced to do extreme amounts of exercise. One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.'Deeply offensive' body searchBaobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the schoolA staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessionsBaobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the handSocial pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.Viral lettersEnxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.Secret filmingUndercover footage shows students doing military-style drills at a new school set up by former employees of Li Zheng schoolsMr Li keeps a relatively low public profile. The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\". He also says students are bussed between different sites to avoid inspections.'Huge profits'Two undercover researchers recently visited what may be the latest addition to the Li Zheng network.Posing as investors in the Hong Kong education sector, the researchers set up a meeting with three former employees of Li Zheng schools, in a new school they have set up in Fujian.\"The profits in this industry are huge,\" Li Yunfeng, the director of counselling at the new school, told them. He outlined how the business model could work in Hong Kong, suggesting fees of at least $25,000 (£19,000) per student annually.He declined to disclose the name of their boss, but said he was \"a veteran\".He appeared to distance himself from the network, however, telling the undercover researchers: \"There were some incidents. The parents lodged a complaint. The group... though not formally dissolved yet, it's teetering on the brink of collapse. That's why I stepped out.\"Secret filmingLi Yunfeng told undercover researchers the previous group was \"on the brink of collapse\" but he is helping open a new schoolThe BBC was not able to reach Li Zheng, Li Yunfeng and other schools and companies linked to Li Zheng and his associates for comment, despite multiple attempts.The staff member who provided a tour of the Quality Education for Teenagers school declined to comment. The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\". It says all educational institutions \"are required to comply with relevant laws and regulations\".'Terribly sad'Enxu and her friend Wang want to see all disciplinary schools shut down. They work to gather video evidence of abuse and abduction, believing this is crucial to get the police to investigate, sometimes posting it online.Wang often receives requests from students. He has helped with the logistics of escape attempts and by pressuring schools to allow students to leave.Baobao never returned to education, which she says makes her feel \"terribly sad\". She now makes a living through online streaming and gaming, but believes she might have gone to university if she had not been sent to the Lizheng Quality Education School.\"These schools are essentially scams,\" she says.\"The prevailing educational ethos is one of violence begetting violence… the very concept is fundamentally flawed,\" she says, adding that they \"simply shouldn't exist\".Details of organisations offering information and support with mental health, distress or despair, or sexual abuse or violence, are available at BBC ActionLine.Additional reporting by Alex Mattholie and Shanshan Chen",

The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "3 hours agoA grim flu forecast for the UK in the lead up to Christmas is dominating the papers on Friday, with the Guardian describing it as the \"worst ever winter crisis\" as serious cases reach record levels. The NHS has warned that the outbreak is yet to peak and things will get worse in the days ahead, with GPs, hospitals and ambulance services already under \"intense strain\".The highest flu case numbers are being reported in children at school, according to the i Paper, with children under five particularly affected. The NHS is urging vulnerable people to get vaccinated, with the caveat that it takes two weeks following the jab to reach full immunity.The Express is condemning the \"reckless\" planned strike by resident doctors next week, and writes that Health Secretary Wes Streeting has urged medical professionals to focus on tackling \"rocketing\" flu cases.\"Strikes may force NHS to collapse\" warns the health secretary in the Times. In an article for the paper, Streeting says that it will be the most challenging winter for the NHS since the pandemic. A fresh offer has been put before the British Medical Association, which has agreed to poll their members to see if they are willing to call off the five-day walkout. The results of the vote will be announced on Monday.Ticket prices for the World Cup 2026 have been announced, prompting \"fan outrage, the Daily Mirror reports. Its headline reads \"World Cup of greed\", emblazoned over a photo of US President Donald Trump and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino grinning at the White House. The Financial Times leads with objections from China, and a number of European Union nations, to the planned exemptions for US multinationals from global tax obligations. According to the paper, this raises the risk of the Trump administration issuing a \"revenge tax\" on backers of the OECD's proposed tax regime.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is quoted on the front page of the Independent, after he warned that Europe must prepare for a conflict with Russia \"on the scale our grandparents endured\". Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Rutte urged European nations to rapidly boost defence spending as a deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Telegraph also focuses on defence spending, following its interview with Minister for Armed Forces Alistair Carns. He told the paper that Nato countries, including the UK, must increase their \"lethality\", and stop relying on US security guarantees.Comments from Carns are also cited in the Daily Mail's headline, which reads: \"Britain is on a war footing\". Echoing the remarks made by Mark Rutte, the minister said that the \"shadow of war was at Europe's door\". \"Pubs ban MPs in tax raid fury\" says the Sun, reporting on a campaign lead by Taxed Out, which is encouraging hospitality businesses to bar Labour ministers in protest against higher tax bills. Four alleged art thieves have been captured on CCTV and splashed across the front page of Metro, after 600 objects of \"significant cultural value\" were stolen from the Bristol Museum's warehouse in September this year. The items had been housed in the warehouse since 2012, and included artefacts \"linked to Britain's colonial past\".The Star's headline reads \"Runaway in a manger\", following reports of a man on the run found hiding in an Italian nativity scene.

    "body": "7 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCThe four pairs of contestants had to make their way more than 3,500 miles through Central AmericaSpoiler warning: This article reveals the winners of Celebrity Race Across the World.Broadcaster Roman Kemp and his sister, singer-songwriter Harleymoon, have triumphed in the latest series of the BBC's Race Across the World.They reached the final checkpoint ahead of the three other pairs of contestants after a 33-day, 5,900km (3,600 mile) quest through Central America.The pair reached the finish line two minutes before EastEnders actress Molly Rainford and her fiancé, TV and radio host Tyler West, with broadcaster Anita Rani and her dad Bal finishing six hours later. Derry Girls actor Dylan Llewellyn and his mum Jackie came fourth - having decided to leave the race earlier in the episode because of limited funds.Wednesday's final episode covered the last stage, a 1,000km route from Medellín to the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia.In previous stages, the teams had to make their ways through countries including Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama.They did so without using phones or air travel, and with a budget of £950 per person - the equivalent cost of flying the route.This was the BBC's third celebrity series of Race Across the World and has been attracting about six million viewers.Roman and Harleymoon Kemp are the children of Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and wife Shirlie.Roman is know as co-host of BBC One's The One Show and Capital's former breakfast show DJ, while Harleymoon is a country singer who has been releasing music for five years.Celebrity Race Across the World winners revealedThe final journey saw them take a 4x4, boat ride and race by foot up a cliffside, with Ronan describing it as \"the most adrenaline, most emotion that I've had ever\".Harleymoon added: \"I've never run like that in my whole life.\"Rainford, 25, is known for playing Anna Knight in EastEnders since 2023 and reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2022.She met Kiss radio host West when he was also a contestant on the same series of Strictly, and they announced their engagement earlier this year.Rani is known as co-host of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour and BBC One's Countryfile, and was racing with her dad Balvinder Singh Nazran, a semi-retired businessman.Dylan Llewellyn, who has been racing with mum Jackie, is known for playing James in hit sitcom Derry Girls, as well as for roles in Big Boys and Beyond Paradise.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterLily JamaliNorth America technology correspondentUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.\"We want to have one central source of approval,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most \"onerous\" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, with firms pouring billions of dollars into the technology.The BBC has contacted AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic for comment.But the announcement has been met with opposition. The state of California, which is the home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, already has its own AI regulations.California's Governor Gavin Newsom, who is a vocal critic of Trump, issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order, accusing him of corruption.\"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology.\"Earlier this year, Newsom signed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit risks stemming from their AI models.States including Colorado and New York have also passed laws regulating the development of the technology.Newsom has said the law sets a standard that US lawmakers could follow. Other critics of Trump's executive order argue that state laws are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.\"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJoe McFaddenHealth reporterRose StokesRose Stokes is a freelance journalist and mother of twoAfter giving birth to her second child, Rose Stokes was exhausted all the time. \"I couldn't really do anything more than the bare minimum in terms of looking after my kids. I'd put them down at seven and have to get straight into bed,\" the freelance journalist says.Rose thought it was just what being a mum of two young children was like.But being tired wasn't the only problem. \"I also had other symptoms, like my hair was falling out.\"I had a funny, metallic taste [in my mouth] all the time. I kept getting tongue ulcers as well and [experienced] breathlessness and dizziness.\"I went to the doctor's a few times and every time was told, 'oh well, you're a mum of small children, what do you expect?' - but the level of exhaustion was just so intense,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.After several visits to her doctor, Rose requested a blood test which showed low levels of the protein ferritin.While Rose's first doctor initially dismissed her ferritin levels as, in her words, \"not being that low\", she managed to see another doctor who eventually gave her a diagnosis - iron deficiency.It's a relatively common problem, especially in women. Around 8% of women have it, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, while far fewer men are affected  – only 3% in the UK.Pregnancy - like Rose had just experienced - is a common cause.Rose's symptoms - tiredness, dizziness and tongue ulcers - are just some of the things to look out for.Other common symptoms can include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, paler than usual skin and headaches, while some people could experience rarer symptoms like tinnitus, restless legs syndrome and hair loss.For her deficiency, Rose was initially prescribed iron tablets - the most common form of treatment - but, despite trying three different ones, found none of them agreed with her.Dr Sue Pavord, a consultant haematologist at NHS Hospitals Oxford, says taking iron tablets first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a glass of water or some Vitamin C is the best approach - otherwise you risk them not working effectively. After she responded badly to tablets, Rose's doctor referred her for an iron infusion - a way of quickly getting iron into your bloodstream.This can be \"transformative for women with severe deficiency\", Dr Pavord says, but she also stresses that tablets can work \"extremely well\" so it's important to try them first.But what you eat can also help limit your risk of becoming iron deficient in the first place, according to Dr Pavord.She suggests foods which contain absorbable iron like red meat, chicken, liver and fish. Vegetables like spinach, kale and broccoli also contain iron, but the body doesn't absorb it from these sources as effectively as meat.Two-and-a-half months on from her infusion, Rose says she feels like \"a completely different person\".\"I can do stuff. Initially it was just like getting to the end of the day and being like, right, we can sit and watch some TV or being able to get up with the kids in the morning and not feeling like I was dying.\"",

    "body": "Operations and treatments cut back as NHS orders hospitals to save money4 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesAccess to hospital treatments is being restricted in many areas of England as the NHS struggles to balance its books, the BBC has learnt.Regional health boards have ordered some hospitals to cut back on the number of patients they are seeing, meaning hundreds of thousands of patients could have to wait longer for treatment.The rationing measures are being applied mainly to private firms doing NHS work, but multiple NHS hospitals are understood to be affected too.NHS managers said they were between a \"rock and a hard place\" trying to juggle balancing the books with tackling the hospital backlog, which currently stands at 7.4 million.Reducing waits for things like hip and knee operations and hitting the 18-week waiting time target is the government's number one priority for the health service.But documents seen by the BBC show integrated care boards, which are in charge of spending on behalf of NHS England, asking hospitals to make patients wait longer and reduce the numbers they treat until the end of the financial year.One asked a private provider to reduce activity by nearly 30% and to make patients wait eight weeks longer, on average, while stopping taking on new referrals for a period as a way to cut back on the amount being done.Surgery cancelledA surgeon at a private hospital said they had had to cancel all their scheduled NHS operations for the coming weeks, with some patients only given a few days' notice.They told the BBC: \"I had a full day of joint surgery planned this week and patients were just told a few weeks before that their life-changing operations would not be taking place.\"Many of them had been waiting over 40 weeks for treatment. It's devastating for them.\"A letter by Circle, one of the biggest private hospital providers in the country, to its doctors said at some sites they may have to stop seeing NHS patients altogether.Daniel Elkeles, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals, said restrictions were also being placed on some NHS hospitals, calling it a \"real concern\".\"If the government really wants them to deliver the 18-week target they would have to go flat out and use all available capacity and that will mean needing additional funding.\"Regional health boards are using what are known as activity management plans to push individual hospitals into reducing the number of patients they see.They are predominantly being used when hospitals are treating more patients than expected.They can also be used to push hospitals into treating more when activity levels are below expected.The BBC has seen evidence or had confirmation from a host of health boards that restrictions have been put in places in parts of the north west, north east, south west, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia.A number of health boards refused to provide the BBC with information – and senior NHS sources said they expected many of England's 42 regional boards were now placing restrictions on individual hospitals in their areas.They said they expected the number of hospitals affected would almost certainly grow before the end of the financial year, adding strike action by resident doctors had not helped with the NHS estimating the walkouts this year have cost hospitals more than £500m.It is estimated the orders in place against the private hospitals that have reported so far could lead to 140,000 fewer patients starting treatment by the end of March. But given some NHS hospitals are affected and not all the restrictions placed on private hospitals are thought to have been been declared  that could be an underestimate.David Hare,  of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, said: \"Given it is patient choice driving demand for treatment in the independent sector - and the scale of the challenge in getting NHS waiting lists down - we‘ve been surprised by the extent of the  proposed slowdown, which will leave significant amounts of available capacity going unused across both the independent sector and the NHS.”Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: \"These reports are deeply alarming and poses a serious risk to patients' ability to access the treatment they urgently need.\"Calling it 'activity management plans' distracts from what this really is, another barrier standing between patients and timely care.\"It won't just delay treatment - it will worsen conditions, reduce quality of life and lead to harm that could harm that could have been prevented.\"Sarah Walter, of the NHS Confederation, which represents regional health boards, said her members were having to make some \"difficult decisions\".\"The NHS faces an unprecedented financial challenge which has resulted in system leaders having to make some very tough decisions over how limited funding and tight budgets should be spent.\"Leaders are caught between a rock and a hard place of being tasked with balancing their books and hitting the elective care target.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterAn inquiry into the role of the UK government's economic forecaster is being launched by a group of MPs, after the body came under intense scrutiny in the run-up to the Budget.The Treasury Committee will examine the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) first 15 years and consider potential reforms, including any improvements or changes to its remit.The inquiry comes after questions over the OBR's influence were raised ahead of the Budget and after its head, Richard Hughes, resigned following an error which saw its key economic forecast published an hour before Rachel Reeves delivered her speech.But committee chair Dame Meg Hillier said the inquiry \"is not a stick to beat the OBR with\".The OBR's role is to produce forecasts, examine the cost of government policies and see whether the chancellor is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on managing the economy.But in the lead up to the Budget, some experts questioned whether the institution was too powerful and had too much influence over government tax and spending decisions.The OBR was in the spotlight before the Budget when it lowered its forecast for productivity, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves argued would make it harder to meet her spending rules.However, it later emerged the productivity downgrade alone was offset by higher tax receipts and the economic picture was better than widely thought, prompting claims that Reeves had misled the public over the state of public finances, which the chancellor has denied.A senior figure of the OBR, Professor David Miles, told the Treasury committee last week he believed the chancellor's comments were \"not inconsistent\" with the situation she faced. Prof Miles said the watchdog was not \"at war\" with the Treasury and added the OBR raised concerns with Treasury officials about leaks to the media. Reeves admitted to MPs this week there were too many unauthorised leaks ahead of the Budget.Dame Meg said the OBR had an important role, but it was often criticised by \"frustrated economists who feel they should be in charge because they shout the loudest\".\"And we need only remember Liz Truss' mini-Budget to remind ourselves of what happens when the OBR is sidelined,\" she added.\"What my Committee intends to do is have an honest conversation about what the watchdog does well and where it needs to do better.\"The inquiry also comes after the OBR published a key document early on Budget day, effectively confirming a number of new measures before they were announced by Reeves.That error led to the resignation of OBR chair Mr Hughes just days later.The OBR was created in 2010 to provide independent analysis of the government's finances, and on Budget day it publishes its report on the health of the British economy alongside the chancellor's statement.The Treasury Committee will look at how well the OBR has communicated its forecasts and analysis, and how that has improved over time, whether it has improved Treasury's forecasting processes, and whether it has performed its role with impartiality and transparency.MPs will also consider what changes could be needed to improve the organisation and its communications, resources, and broader role and remit.Dame Meg said she hoped the inquiry would be useful for the new chair when they are appointed.",

    "body": "9 hours agoLaura GozziReutersThe US has proposed Ukraine withdraw from the eastern Donetsk region and create a \"special economic zone\" in the areas it currently controls, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.Zelensky said territory and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remained the two main unresolved issues in the peace plan proposal for Ukraine.In a sobering briefing to reporters, Zelensky addressed the US desire for a quick end to the conflict, the complex nature of the ongoing negotiations, and his belief that Russia had no desire to stop the war.Ukraine has sent the US an updated 20-point plan plus separate documents on security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.It follows weeks of high-level diplomatic activity which has seen several peace plans drawn up, adjusted and revised by the US, Ukraine, Russia and European leaders.\"The final mile is the hardest. Everything could fall apart for many reasons,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. Russia demands that Ukraine relinquish control of roughly 30% of the eastern Donetsk region it still holds - something Ukraine has refused to do, both on principle and because it fears it would allow Moscow a foothold for future invasions.According to Zelensky, the US is now envisaging a solution that would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk, and Russian forces committing to not advancing into the territory. This area would become a \"special economic zone\" or a \"demilitarised zone\", Zelensky said.However, he noted that it would not be fair for the Ukrainians to withdraw unilaterally, and that Russia should also pull back by the same distance. \"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" he asked.Zelensky said these were \"very serious concerns\" and that Ukraine might not accept the proposal at all – although he opened the door to elections or a referendum to give the Ukrainian people a choice.But he acknowledged that the fighting would continue and may yet shape the future of the negotiations: \"Much depends on our military – what they can hold, where they can stop the enemy, what they can destroy. This affects the entire configuration.\"The management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was another highly contentious point, Zelensky said.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Zelensky said a possible solution would be for the Russians to withdraw and Kyiv to share control of the plant with the Americans – although he acknowledged that the details of such an arrangement were still unclear, and it is doubtful that Moscow would agree.US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated with the intricacies of the conflict, and Kyiv and its allies fear the Americans might eventually seek to impose a Russian-led solution on Ukraine.Zelensky told reporters that although the Americans wanted a \"quicker conclusion\" to the war, there were no deadlines for an agreement. Ukraine - which is targeted by widespread aerial attacks on a near-nightly basis - has been pushing for respite and would want an immediate ceasefire to be implemented ahead of a more laborious agreement being fleshed out.But Russia stands to gain more from a ceasefire being delayed, as its troops continue to make small but incremental gains on the frontline and its attacks exhaust the Ukrainian population.\"After multiple rounds of talks with Russia\" the Americans were now aligned on Moscow on this position, Zelensky said. Kremlin officials have been more tight-lipped than their European, US and Ukrainian counterparts. However, whenever possible, Russia has sought to cement the impression that Moscow and Washington are aligned on their hopes for the terms of a peace deal.On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump for trying to broker a deal and said a recent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin had \"eliminated\" the \"misunderstandings\" between the two sides.The foreign minister also batted off suggestions that Kyiv could be given security guarantees in the form of foreign troops stationed in Ukraine.\"This is yet another return to the sad logic of Zelensky's so-called peace formula,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow had handed the US \"additional\" proposals on collective security and that Russia was ready to give legal guarantees not to attack Nato or EU countries.But neither Ukraine nor Europe will be likely to take any promise by Moscow at face value, given Russia has previously violated ceasefires and truce deals.European and Ukrainian officials want the US to be involved in giving security guarantees so that Kyiv doesn't become the target of renewed attacks.Zelensky said he had received a draft proposal on American security guarantees but that the draft was a work in progress, suggesting that what has been offered by the US falls short of provisions that could assuage Kyiv's fears.\"The US does not want Ukraine in Nato. They say this openly... So I do not think they have difficulties discussing Nato with the Russians,\" Zelensky said.Zelensky also said Ukraine had to be \"cautious\", adding: \"We do not know what other agreements the US may have with Russia. We will learn in time.\" Ukraine's president also acknowledged that US support for Kyiv may one day end, both in terms of the flow of weapons that the US is selling through other countries and in terms of intelligence sharing. Reflecting the fraught nature of the talks and his scepticism that Russia was negotiating in good faith, Zelensky told reporters: \"No one knows what may happen the day after tomorrow... We do not know how these negotiations will end.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris VallanceSenior technology reporterGoogle has announced plans to team up with the UK to invite researchers to come up with uses for the tech giant's state-of-the-art quantum chip Willow.It is one of several firms competing to develop a powerful quantum computer - which is seen as an exciting new frontier in the future of computing.Researchers hope they will be able to crack problems in fields such as chemistry and medicine which are impossible for current computers to solve.Professor Paul Stevenson of the University of Surrey - who had no involvement with the agreement - told the BBC it was \"great news for UK researchers\".The collaboration between Google and the UK's national lab for quantum computing means more researchers will get access to the technology.\"The new ability to access Google's Willow processor, through open competition, puts UK researchers in an enviable position,\" said Prof Stevenson. \"It is good news for Google, too, who will benefit from the skills of UK academics.\"What is quantum computing, and will it be bigger than AI?Quantum devices work in a fundamentally different way to the computers powering our smartphones and laptops, solving problems using technologies based on the science of particle physicsBut the full potential of the technology has yet to be realised and the machines that currently exist have few practical applications and most are experimental.It is hoped giving UK researchers access to Willow would help \"uncover new real world applications\".Scientists will be able to submit proposals describing how they intend to use the chip, and they will work with experts from Google and the UK quantum lab to design and conduct experiments. When it was unveiled in 2024, Google's Willow chip was seen as a significant step forward in the field.Rival firms including Amazon and IBM are also developing their own tech.The UK has a significant quantum industry. Quantinuum, which has headquarters in Cambridge and Colorado, US, reached a $10bn (£7.45bn) valuation in September.Announcements of new developments from firms throughout 2025 have led some experts to believe powerful machines capable of having real-world impact will be developed within a decade.Dr Michael Cuthbert, Director at the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) said the partnership would \"accelerate discovery\".He said the cutting edge science it would support could ultimately lead to quantum computing being used in areas such as \"life science, materials, chemistry, and fundamental physics\".The NQCC already hosts seven quantum computers from British-based firms such as Quantum Motion, ORCA and Oxford Ionics.The government says it is committing £670m to support the tech, which is a priority area in the UK's Industrial Strategy. Officials believe quantum could contribute £11 billion to the UK economy by 2045.",

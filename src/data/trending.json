    "body": "The World Cup draw is here - this is how it will workImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington DC has been chosen for the World Cup draw, though the city will not host any matchesByFootball issues correspondentUpdated 28 minutes agoPots, quadrants, confederation constraints, group position grids... the 2026 World Cup finals draw on Friday is not going to be a straightforward affair.  There's a lot to unpack so we're going to explain it as simply as we can.Luckily, Fifa will have a computer to do most of the heavy lifting and make sure everything runs smoothly. Though as Uefa found out in 2021, sometimes technology does go wrong. Let's hope there will be no gremlins in Washington once the draw ceremony kicks off.Here is how it will work, what to expect and a few key things to look out for. When will draw start and how long will it take?Media caption, Dan Roan reports from Washington before the 2026 World Cup drawThe ceremony gets started at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time) on 5 December, but there's going to be far more to this glitzy event than simply pulling the countries out of a hat. Supermodel Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor and producer Danny Ramirez will co-host.Before the draw there will be live music performances from Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger, while Fifa president Gianni Infantino and US President Donald Trump are both expected to make speeches.Then it is on to video clips of the finalists, introductions and the draw itself.Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand will conduct the draw.The 47-year-old will be joined by broadcaster Samantha Johnson and a host of sporting greats, including Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal.Once the draw has been completed, the Village People will perform YMCA to bring the curtain down, with the entire ceremony expected to last about 90 minutes.How has Fifa seeded the draw?The 48 teams have been placed into four pots of 12 based primarily on Fifa world rankings.The exceptions are the three hosts who are automatically in pot one, and the teams who will qualify through the six play-off paths, who go into pot four.Given some of the teams involved in the four European play-off paths, they have the potential to create some strong groups.Italy and Denmark would have been in pot two because of their world rankings had they qualified directly, while Wales would have been in pot three.The six play-off paths are:Uefa Play-off A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern IrelandUefa Play-off B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania, SwedenUefa Play-off C: Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo, RomaniaUefa Play-off D: Denmark, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland, North MacedoniaFifa Play-off 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New CaledoniaFifa Play-off 2: Iraq, Bolivia, SurinameHow will the draw work?The 12 groups will include one team from each of the four pots.Fifa will start by drawing the teams from pot one.Co-hosts Mexico (A1), Canada (B1) and the United States (D1) will have coloured balls with their flags on to denote their special status. Their group positions are pre-determined to make sure they play all their games in their own countries.The draw will then continue with pots two, three and four in order.What is this about the top four teams being kept apart?Fifa's big idea is to set up the best chance of blockbuster ties in the latter stages of the World Cup. So for the first time it is giving special seeding status to the top four in the world rankings - Spain, Argentina, France and England.Crucially, this status will only apply if the countries win their groups. Let's take a look at how it will work, using England as our example.Each of the four countries will be drawn into a group in a different coloured quadrant of the bracket, as shown in the image below. Spain (ranked 1) and Argentina (2) must be in opposite halves and cannot meet until the final, likewise France (3) and England (4). France and England would not be able to meet either Spain or Argentina until the semi-finals. Let's say that France come out first and go into Group C, placing them into the green quadrant on the right side of the draw. That means England can only go into the blue or turquoise quadrants on the left side, groups E, F, G, H or I.If Argentina then drop into the blue quadrant, that further restricts England only to turquoise - groups G or H.    Are the four seeds being given an easy ride? Not necessarily.Each quadrant has a potential last-16 tie between two group winners. For instance, the blue quadrant has a meeting of the winners of Group E and Group I. That means a seeded team could meet another pot one side, let's say perhaps Brazil.Being drawn into groups C, F, H or J looks potentially more favourable, as it is not possible to play another group winner until the quarter-finals.If one of the four seeded teams finishes as group runners-up, then they lose the ranking privilege. So if England were to finish second in Group H, they would move out of turquoise and into red - perhaps meeting Spain, Argentina or France as the winners of Group J in the first knockout round.Image source, FifaImage caption, If Spain, Argentina, France and England win their groups they will slot into separate quadrants for the knockout bracketWhat are the draw restrictions to watch out for?There can be no more than one team from the same confederation per group. So, for instance, Brazil and Uruguay (Conmebol) cannot be in the same group, nor can Panama and the United States (Concacaf). There is an exception for Uefa because there are 16 teams and only 12 groups. That means four groups will contain two European nations. It all seems relatively straightforward, but as we go on these constraints are going to cause some serious complications as countries skip groups to avoid clashes with teams from their own confederation. That means it will not just be case of teams slotting into Group A, and then Group B, and then Group C in order as they are drawn. When we get to pots three and four, it might seem like countries are being sent to random groups. Fifa needs to prevent something called deadlocking, which happens when it is no longer possible to complete the draw while following the regulations.  The major issue comes from the teams who can potentially qualify via the inter-confederation play-off pathways and will go into pot four. Pathway 1 has New Caledonia (OFC), Jamaica (Concacaf) and DR Congo (CAF)Pathway 2 has Bolivia (Conmebol), Suriname (Concacaf) and Iraq (AFC)Both pathways have a Concacaf team, so they are automatically blocked out of four groups (those containing the United States, Mexico, Canada and Panama). The first pathway is less of problem, because the only other Oceania team, New Zealand, are also in pot four. But the second pathway makes it complicated, because there are 17 deadlocking nations in pots one, two and three. So, the only way to complete the draw is for the team that qualifies via this route to go into a group with two European countries and an African nation.What will this look like in practice?When pot two is being drawn, the computer will have to ensure that there is at least one group with two European teams, or one European and one African country.When it comes to pot three, there will then be two possible draw routes. If there is one group with two European nations in it, then Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia or Ivory Coast must join it. If there is one group with an African and European nation in it, then Norway or Scotland must go into it. Both could happen, in which case the draw computer will ensure one is filled as necessary. If we get to pot four and there is only one group which meets this criterion, pathway two will have to go into it.The other pot-four teams - the four potential play-off winners from Uefa, two from Concacaf, two African and one Asian nation - will have their own deadlock restrictions. The Uefa play-off paths, which include Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, will have limited options because 12 European teams will already have been drawn.   It might be hard to keep up at this point. How will teams be allocated to their groups?Once a team has been drawn they will go into the first available group, adhering to the draw constraints, in alphabetical order. The draw computer will ensure Spain, Argentina, France and England are placed in groups in the correct quadrant of the bracket.To speed up the process countries will not be drawn into their specific group positions to set the order of the fixtures.Seeded countries will all go into position one, with a pre-determined grid for all the other pots, as shown in the image below.For instance, let's take Scotland in pot three. Their fixture order will be determined by the yellow box.If they are drawn first from pot three they will go into Group A with Mexico. The grid shows the team from pot three will go into position two. The first match is A1 v A2, so Mexico would play Scotland in the opening game of the World Cup.Image source, FifaImage caption, The group position by pot has been pre-determined and will not be decided by drawWhen will teams find out when and where they will play?While nations will know their opponents and match dates on Friday, 5 December they will have to wait 24 hours to find out venues and kick-off times.The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations and already have venues for the fixtures, but not kick-off times.For all other groups, you'll know only the date and the order of matches when Fifa unveils the match schedule in a live broadcast on Saturday, 6 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). Fifa president Gianni Infantino will be joined on stage by legends of the game to discuss the key matches.All 12 groups will play fixtures in this order:Match Day 1: 1 v 2, 3 v 4Match Day 2: 1 v 3, 4 v 2Match Day 3: 4 v 1, 2 v 3",

    "body": "40 minutes agoMinisters are attempting to broker a deal with the EU and other countries to give frozen Russian assets in the UK worth £8bn to Ukraine, reports the Times.  The paper says they are also warning Vladimir Putin is an \"active threat to the UK's citizens, security and prosperity\". A photo of Israeli Eurovision singer Yuval Raphael is splashed across the paper after the competition was \"hit by boycotts\" from several nations over the inclusion of Israel.The Guardian focuses on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage who it says \"turned on broadcasters\" for questioning him about racist and antisemitic comments he is alleged to have made as a teenager. The politician gave an \"angry performance\" at a press conference, vowing to boycott ITV and the BBC - and also pointing out the networks had shown homophobic and racist content themselves in the 1970s and 1980s. Farage has denied the claims against him and the Guardian says Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice called the former classmates liars.For the Daily Mail, \"Farage's 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' attack on BBC double standards\" is in the lead. The Reform UK leader said the corporation should issue an apology for broadcasting the programme - as well as The Black and White Minstrel Show - if it wanted to apply the standards of today to the 1970s. Reform UK have been thrust into the \"fundraising lead\" reports the Financial Times after an expat entrepreneur's record £9m gift. The paper also snaps Russian President Vladimir Putin in a car with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the pair met in New Delhi at the start of a two-day summit.Ex-Masterchef host John Torode is \"in therapy over TV axe\" reads the headline of the Sun. He says he is suffering from \"grief\" after being fired from the show when an allegation of racism against him was upheld. Torode has denied the allegations.There are \"fears of worst flu wave to strike NHS this winter\" says the Daily Express. Experts have urged people to get a jab, it adds. The paper also features a photo of England cricketer Joe Root who has scored a century in the Ashes. \"Even Australia will have to admit he's a great now,\" it writes.The Daily Star also headlines on Joe Root's cricketing success with \"not out\" after he \"saves fans from Oz legend's balls\". \"Dawn's blood on his hands\" leads the Daily Mirror after an inquiry found Russian President Vladimir Putin to be \"morally responsible\" for the death of Dawn Sturgess. The \"Russian tyrant ordered his assassins to attack\" British agent Sergei Skripal writes the Mirror, before \"recklessly\" discarding the perfume bottle containing the poison that ultimately killed the mother-of-three in Salisbury.\"Putin personally ordered novichok attack on Salisbury\" headlines the Independent, also reporting on the conclusion of the inquiry. The attack was intended to show \"Russian power\", the paper quotes the author of the review, retired Supreme Court judge Anthony Hughes, as saying. In a snap of Joe root, the Indy asks if England can \"stage an Ashes comeback?\"For the Daily Telegraph, David Lammy has broken \"ranks\" on Brexit as it says the deputy prime minister refused to rule out reversing the UK's withdrawal from the EU process seven times. The Telegraph dubs Putin and Modi \"brothers in arms\" sharing the same picture as the FT on its front.  Calling Labour the \"party of welfare\" is \"ignorant\", Labour's Liz Kendall has said in an exclusive for the i Paper. The chair of the government's child poverty taskforce said \"we're the party that backs kids and their future\". The i dubs Joe Root \"the GOAT\" for \"finally\" getting his Ashes ton.Metro dubs the Lake District the \"Quake District\" after a 3.3 magnitude tremor left locals and tourists \"quaking with fear\".The Times reports that ministers are prepared to hand over £8bn of Russian assets, which are frozen in Britain, to support Ukraine. The paper says the move is part of an international push to increase pressure on Moscow, and that as much as £100bn could be released for Ukraine's war effort, if the UK manages to broker a deal with the EU and other countries including Canada.The Novichok Inquiry is the lead for the Daily Mirror, which carries photos of Dawn Sturgess and Russian President Vladimir Putin on its front page. The inquiry on Thursday found that Putin was \"morally responsible\" for the death of Ms Sturgess who was poisoned by the deadly nerve agent in Salisbury in 2018. \"Dawn's Blood on his hands\" is the headline.Comments from Deputy Prime Minsiter David Lammy that leaving the EU has \"badly damaged\" the UK economy, and that re-joining the EU customs union would \"boost economic growth\", are the lead for the Daily Telegraph. The paper reports that the deputy prime minister refused to rule out \"reversing\" the Brexit process during a podcast interview, but said re-joining the EU customs union was not \"currently\" the government's policy.The Guardian says five more contemporaries of the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have alleged to the paper that they witnessed racist or anti-semitic behaviour from him when they were at school. He denies saying anything offensive \"with malice\". The Daily Mail leads on Farage's attack on the BBC during a news conference, saying he \"turned the tables\" on the broadcaster, criticising some of its output in the 1970s and 80s which he said would be considered racist, sexist and homophobic by today's standards.The i Paper has spoken to Liz Kendall, the chair of the government's child poverty task force, ahead of the launch of its poverty strategy on Friday. Ms Kendall,  it reports, defended her party's tax rises in last week's Budget. It quotes her as saying that it would be \"ignorant\" to call Labour the \"party of welfare\", but that it is the party that \"backs kids and their future\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Pubs in England and Wales could stay open until 01:00 next summer if a home nation reaches the quarter-finals or further at the football World Cup.The government has launched a six-week public consultation on extending pub licensing hours to allow fans to come together and support the teams.The tournament kicks off next June in the US, Canada and Mexico - which feature time zones at least five hours behind the UK. The consultation proposes a potential extension to licensing hours for the semi-finals and final until 01:00, if matches kick-off at 21:00 or earlier UK time.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has the legislative power to extend pub opening hours on occasions of \"exceptional international, national or local significance\".They were previously extended at last year's Women's 2025 Euro, the Men's 2024 Euro final and Women's Euro 2022 Final.Pub opening hours were also extended for the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day in May this year.This extension would only apply to England and Wales as Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate licensing regimes.The home secretary said: \"Our nation's pubs are going into extra time. If any nation reaches the final stages, we will extend licensing hours.\"Next year's tournament will be the first time a World Cup has been hosted by three nations.England and Scotland will learn their group stage opponents on Friday at the finals draw in Washington DC.Wales and Northern Ireland also have a chance of reaching the tournament when they compete in the play-offs, where a total of 16 teams will battle it out for four slots at the competition.Michael Kill, CEO of the Night-Time Industries Association, welcomed the move to allow pubs to stay open later, saying: \"We believe this consultation represents a positive step in ensuring that the hospitality industry can contribute fully to the nation's excitement and economic activity during such a landmark event.\"Emma McClarkin, CEO of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: \"The pub has and always will be the home of live sport and there's no better place to gather under one roof during moments of huge national significance and make memories.\"Kate Nicholls, chair of industry group UKHospitality, said: \"I'm pleased the government is once again looking at extended licensing hours... it can provide a real boost for hospitality businesses\".The consultation runs until January and a decision by the Home Office will be taken as soon as possible once responses have been reviewed.

    "body": "8 hours agoEmily HoltMary McCarthyMary McCarthy has been driving for almost 20 years, but has only driven on the motorway about ten times in her life because they terrify her.\"I can remember every time I used one, and it was an absolute disaster.\" \"I sit in my lane and I'm frozen, totally petrified. I can't overtake and because you don't overtake, people start to beep at you and that drives me into more of a frenzy,\" she says. Over time, her fear built up, and she just began to avoid motorway driving altogether.Mary says for her driving on the motorway is akin to playing the video game Mario Kart, with the speed of other drivers making her anxious.Even as a passenger she can't relax, and says her anxiety makes her husband a \"nervous wreck\" when he is driving. To avoid motorways, Mary usually asks her siblings or her 80-year-old father to take her on longer journeys, but feels embarrassed about it.\"I'm just scared, I've set up my life to avoid it,\" she tells the BBC's Woman's Hour.Mary's driving anxiety isn't unusual. Diane Curtis Knight, a driving instructor who specialises in helping anxious drivers, says a fear of motorways is one of the most common issues she's asked to help with.She explains that often the issue isn't the motorway itself, but other problems in your life which cause stress or anxiety and can come out when you're driving.  The first step to addressing the fear, is changing how you talk about the problem, suggesting the word \"yet\" as a powerful word to help with this, she says.\"If someone says, 'I can't drive on motorways', we need to start planting seeds into their subconscious mind to say, 'Well, I can't do that yet, but maybe I can do it at some stage'.\"Mary McCarthyMary now lives in Brussels with her four children, husband and their dogDiane also recommends starting a journal to help identify the barriers that are preventing you taking on certain car journeys. After each drive, she suggests scoring how anxious you felt about the journey beforehand and how it was in reality, with one being totally fine and 10 extremely anxious.\"We tend to find the anticipation of the journey is often worse than the execution.\"Using this as a basis to push yourself to take on more ambitious journeys can slowly help you improve, she says.Other stories you may enjoyTracey Field, a stress management practitioner, runs the website Confident Drivers aimed at helping people who struggle with driving anxiety. She says the issue is often worse in couples where one person takes the lead on driving, which can lead to the other person becoming \"de-skilled\" and \"less confident\".Tracey says it's often this lack of experience that causes problems.\"It's not actually the driving, it's the fear of the unknown, of not knowing automatically what to do when.\"If you are struggling, she recommends having motorway lessons and easing yourself in slowly, for example by using a short junction, travelling at a quieter time of day or practising on a small roundabout. She also suggests learning emotional regulation techniques to keep you calm in the moment, such as breathing exercises or humming.A turning point for Mary came when she realised her driving anxiety was limiting what she could do with her children. As they've got older they increasingly go to different places, and public transport is not always a practical way to get there.\"There have been times when I've said 'you can't make that play date', and I'll feel really bad. \"By motorway, we could go in 22 minutes, but when we get public transport, it's going to take two hours.\"Her 14-year-old daughter asked her why she couldn't just \"lock in\" and drive, even offering help with directions, forcing Mary to explain that she just couldn't do it.Now, ahead of turning 50 next year, she plans to take motorway lessons, partly to set an example to her daughter.\"I need to crack this fear, I would love to be able to drive on a motorway without feeling I am about to die.\"",

    "body": "Deep-sea mining tests impact over a third of seabed animals - scientists19 minutes agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science correspondentNatural History Museum/ University of GothenburgA brittlestar found on the seafloor of the Clarion-Clipperton ZoneMachines mining minerals in the deep ocean have been found to cause significant damage to life on the seabed, scientists carrying out the largest study of its kind say.They found that the number of animals found in the tracks of the vehicles was reduced by 37% compared to untouched areas.The researchers found more than 4,000 animals, 90% of which were new species, living on the seafloor in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.Vast amounts of critical minerals needed for green technologies could be locked in the deep ocean, but deep sea mining in international waters is very controversial and currently not permitted until more is known about the environmental impacts.Natural History Museum/ University of GothenburgThis sea urchin was one of the more than 4,000 creatures foundThe research by scientists at the Natural History Museum in London, the UK National Oceanography Centre and the University of Gothenburg was conducted at the request of deep sea mining company The Metals Company.The scientists said their work was independent and that the company was able to view the results before publication but was not allowed to alter them.The team compared biodiversity two years before and two months after the test mining that drove machines for 80km on the seafloor.They looked specifically at animals 0.3mm – 2cm in size, such as worms, sea spiders, snails and clams.In the tracks of the vehicle, the number of animals fell by 37% and the diversity of species by 32%.\"The machine removes about the top five centimetres of sediment. That's where most of the animals live. So obviously, if you're removing the sediment, you're removing the animals in it too,\" lead author Eva Stewart, PhD student at the Natural History Museum and the University of Southampton, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgThe scientists catalogued all the animals they found in the sediment, including this worm\"Even if they are not killed by the machine, pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species,\" said Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras from the National Oceanography Centre.A few of the animals could have moved away, but \"whether or not they come back after disturbance is a different question\", she added.However, in the areas near the vehicle tracks, where clouds of sediment landed, the abundance of animals did not decrease.\"We were expecting possibly a bit more impact, but [we didn't] see much, just a shift in which species were dominant over others,\" Dr Adrian Glover, research scientist at the Natural History Museum, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea spider was another of macrofauna found during the research\"​We're ​encouraged ​by these ​data,\" a spokesperson for The Metals Company told BBC News.\"After ​years ​of ​activist ​alarm ​that ​our ​impacts ​would ​spread ​thousands ​of ​kilometers ​beyond ​the ​mine ​site, ​the ​data ​show ​that ​any ​biodiversity ​impacts ​are ​limited ​to ​the ​directly ​mined ​area,\" they added. But some experts do not think that this is good news for mining companies.\"I think the study shows that current technologies for harvesting are too damaging to permit large-scale commercial exploration,\" Dr Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at think tank Chatham House, told BBC News.\"These were only tests and the impact was significant. If they did that at large scale, it would be even more damaging,\" he added.Deep sea mining is controversial. At the heart of the debate is a difficult problem.The latest research took place in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a 6m sq km area of the Pacific Ocean estimated to hold over 21bn tonnes of nickel, cobalt and copper-rich polymetallic nodules.The world needs these critical minerals for renewable energy technologies to tackle climate change. They are essential components in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, for example.The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for the minerals could at least double by 2040.The minerals have to come from somewhere, but some scientists and environmental groups are gravely concerned that mining the deep seas could cause untold damage.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea star was also found during the researchSome fear that before we have the chance to explore the full nature of life in the undiscovered deep ocean, it could be endangered. Oceans play a critical role in regulating our planet and are already at severe risk from rising temperatures.The International Seabed Authority (ISA), which governs activity in international waters, has not yet approved commercial mining although it has issued 31 licences for exploration.A total of 37 countries, including the UK and France, are backing a temporary ban on mining.This week Norway postponed mining plans in its waters including the Arctic.But in April, US President Donald Trump called for domestic and international projects to be fast-tracked, as the US wants to secure the supply of minerals for use in weapons.If the ISA concludes that current mining techniques are too destructive, companies could try to develop less intrusive ways of extracting nodules from the seafloor.The research is published in the scientific journal Nature ​Ecology ​and ​Evolution.",

    "body": "A diamond-studded locket swallowed by a New Zealand man who tried to steal it has been \"recovered\", police say.The Fabergé egg locket, valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600), was recovered in a \"natural\" manner. \"Medical intervention [was] not required,\" they told the BBC.This comes about a week after police arrested the 32-year-old man at Patridge Jewellers in central Auckland, minutes after he allegedly ate the locket.The ingested loot is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The man has been charged with theft.Earlier this week, New Zealand police said the man had undergone a medical assessment and is constantly being monitored.\"Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\" police said then.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Partridge Jewellers said the locket will be returned to Fabergé, Radio NZ reported.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to charge sheets seen by the BBC, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoPallab GhoshScience Correspondent One of Britain's most distinguished scientists, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, says the government is \"shooting itself in the foot\" with its visa system for science researchers.Sir Paul told BBC News that high visa fees are deterring early-career researchers, who are instead being welcomed by the UK's economic rivals.Supporters of the current system say higher visa costs help to fund the NHS and reflect wider public concerns about immigration.But the Nobel prize winning scientist says the UK's scientific future is being put at risk.\"Having expensive visa costs is shooting yourself in the foot. It absolutely doesn't help in attracting these sorts of people,\" Sir Paul said.Sir Paul, who has taken over as President of the Royal Society, which represents the UK's leading scientists, warns that countries such as China and Singapore are actively courting overseas scientific talent.\"Why do we put hurdles in the way of the people that are actually going to drive our economy? It makes zero sense.\"The Nobel prize-winner describes the UK's science base as \"fragile\" because of a combination of steep visa costs, funding pressures and the negative signal, current immigration rules.He urges ministers to rethink a system that forces scientists to pay an annual NHS surcharge and to prove they have thousands of pounds in the bank before they arrive.Official guidance on the Immigration Health Surcharge explains that visa applicants pay the surcharge to help fund their healthcare. Home Office guidance states that applicants must show set levels of savings to show they can support themselves \"without recourse to public funds\".The Centre for Policy Studies, a centre-right policy think tank, argues in its report Taking Back Control for net migration  to be brought back down to the \"tens of thousands.\"  But its policy expert on the issue, Karl Williams, broadly agrees with Sir Paul's sentiments, but argues that a tight overall migration limit must be maintained after an historically large recent surge in immigration.\"The wave of immigration we had between 2021 and 2024 is probably the single most significant demographic event in modern British history… If you say yes to one sector, then you start saying yes to other sectors, and you actually just recreate the problems of recent years.\"According to Home Office visa statistics, the total number of people receiving a visa for a job in natural and social science in the last quarter was 323 people.\"Even if you doubled that, that wouldn't make a huge difference to the overall migration numbers,\" Mr Williams told BBC News.\"But there is no robust system to make that work, for example having conversations about where numbers can be reduced in order to let more scientists in\".",

    "body": "US Supreme Court allows Texas to use redrawn voting maps in midterms5 hours agoNardine SaadGetty ImagesThe US Supreme Court has cleared the way for Texas to use a new congressional map that could help the Republican effort to shore up their majority in the coming 2026 midterm elections.Thursday's unsigned decision comes after Texas filed an emergency request last month to block a lower-court ruling that blocked the new map, which was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Republican Governor Greg Abbott in August.In an apparent 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court said in its \"preliminary evaluation of this case\", Texas satisfied the conditions for emergency relief and that the lower court \"committed at least two serious errors\".Three liberal justices dissented.\"The District Court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections,\" the order reads. In November, a lower Texas court said evidence indicated the new voting districts were \"racially gerrymandered\", and ordered the state to use the congressional lines they had in place before they redistricted earlier this year.In the US, gerrymandering - the redrawing of electoral boundaries to favour a political party - is only illegal if it is based on race.Challenges to the mid-decade redistricting came after Democrat lawmakers in Texas fled the state over the summer to stall voting on the new map, helping trigger a race across other states to change their maps too.  California proposed new maps to offset Texas' gains, which voters approved during a November special election. The US justice department is suing over the state's redistricting plan.  In November, Indiana became the latest battleground in the nationwide political tug-of-war, and other states - including Utah and North Carolina - have also entered the fray.The Supreme Court decision marks a win for President Donald Trump. The new map could add up to five Republican seats for the midterm elections as the party fights to keep its narrow majority, and the president had filed a brief asking the top court to rule in favour of Texas.However, in a lengthy dissent to Thursday's order, liberal Justice Elena Kagan said it \"disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race\". Three conservative justices on the court, in a brief concuring opinion, rejected the notion that Republicans in Texas redrew the electoral map based on race.It is \"indisputable\" that the impetus to adopt the Texas map - and subsequently the newly redrawn map in California - was \"partisan advantage pure and simple\", wrote Justice Samuel Alito, joined by justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas.Texas Gov Abbott celebrated the legal victory, praising the high court for restoring the state's redistricting maps, saying: \"We won! Texas is officially—and legally—more red.\" \"The new congressional districts better align our representation in Washington D.C. with the values of our state. This is a victory for Texas voters, for common sense, and for the U.S. Constitution,\" he said.Separately, the leader of the Democrats in the statehouse, Gene Wu, said that the court failed Texas voters and American democracy.\"This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won't protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face.\"Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the Democrats in the House of Representatives in Washington DC, criticised the Texas map as a \"partisan and racially discriminatory power grab designed to subvert the will of the voters\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

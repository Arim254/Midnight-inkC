Ultimately the president gave a full-throated defence of his administration’s achievements this year, with a particular focus on efforts to address the cost of living in the US, which has become synonymous with a debate over affordability.\nThe timing of the president’s speech comes after polling suggests the Republican Party is losing support over the direction of the economy. Earlier this week the vice president JD Vance spoke to workers in Pennsylvania to address their fears, telling them “Rome wasn’t built in a day”. Will Republicans be able to convince voters that they should still be trusted on the economy ahead of next year’s midterms?\nAnthony, Marianna and Nomia sit down to go through the most significant aspects of the president’s speech, including a new “warrior dividend” for US service members…\nHOSTS:\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\n• Nomia Iqbal, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Alix Pickles.

    "body": "Anxious waits for arrivals are nothing new at Christmas as people track special deliveries.But for one Shropshire woman, the package two years ago was more precious than something due in the post. It was the child she adopted - the sister of the boy she had made part of her family the year before.\"[We were] on tenterhooks as to whether she would be here for Christmas,\" remembered Sarah, 44.She was not disappointed. In that December of 2023 she formally became a mum of two. Adopting siblings, she said, was \"the best decision I ever made\". It was, then, the best of times and the busiest of times. Christmas, she recalled, \"is carnage in the best possible way with small children\". And it was a journey to get there. It began when Sarah found out she would be unlikely to have a healthy pregnancy. Her story took a huge stride forward when she adopted her son in July 2022.Sarah described how she had read the then 17-month-old's profile prior to adoption and \"knew he was mine\". She said she \"got butterflies\".She then found out that her son's birth mother was pregnant, and decided to put herself forward as a potential parent for this new baby, should that be needed.The girl, the half sister of Sarah's son, was born on Christmas Day 2022, and the family became a trio the following December.They are about to celebrate their third Christmas together, but Sarah insists on trying to make \"every day special\".She said: \"If I see in a shop a toy or something that I think they'd like, I'll buy it, because it doesn't have to wait until one single day a year.\"Especially with adopted children, a lot of them have trauma in some way, shape or form.\"They can push you away because they feel unsafe. But if you can show them that you aren't going anywhere and you're there forever – if it means that once a month they get a treat – then so be it.\"And to be honest,\" she said, \"as long as the children are happy and content and have got somewhere safe, especially at Christmas, that's what matters.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent An appeal for information has been sent to all MI5 staff over false evidence the service gave to three courts in a neo-Nazi spy case.MI5's regulator is investigating how it came to make false claims about conversations with the BBC.The Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson, who is overseeing the inquiry, said it was \"surprising\" that new material was being uncovered years after the case began.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer ordered the investigation in September after the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts.The prime minister's demand followed requests from the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which both rejected MI5's explanations about what happened. MI5 also gave false evidence to its regulator, Sir Brian Leveson himself, whose office is conducting this new investigation.The case centres on a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X, who used his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend, whom he attacked with a machete.Sir Brian has now sent a letter updating the prime minister, the attorney general and the home secretary on the investigation into the false evidence. In the letter, he reveals the investigation team \"asked that a message be disseminated to all current MI5 staff\", inviting anyone who believes they have information which may assist, to make contact. He adds: \"I am grateful for MI5's prompt and constructive engagement to achieve this.\"But he also notes that \"relevant material\" continues to be identified, adding that it is \"surprising\" four years after the case began and \"over three years after my inspectors first considered the Agent X case.\"Earlier this month, MI5 was heavily criticised by the police investigation into the state agent Stakeknife for only disclosing crucial documents years after that inquiry began. The investigation into the false evidence in the Agent X case is being led by Sir John Goldring, the Deputy Investigatory Powers Commissioner.In the update letter, it is revealed that Sir John and his investigators have interviewed 36 people over the past five weeks, including \"current and former staff of the intelligence services\", as well as BBC staff, government lawyers, and barristers representing MI5.The new investigation is said to have identified \"additional lines of inquiry\" after obtaining material beyond that which was disclosed in the three court cases. The investigation report is not expected to be completed before March.In February this year, the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts while defending its handling of the misogynistic MI5 agent, whom the BBC had sought to expose in a 2022 investigation. Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities.In fact, MI5 had disclosed Agent X's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate him. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls.Following the BBC's revelations, MI5's Director General Sir Ken McCallum issued an \"unreserved apology\" for the false evidence.Two official inquiries then took place which absolved MI5 and its officers of deliberate wrongdoing, claiming the false evidence was down to mistakes and poor memories.But, in July, a panel of senior high court judges ruled that the \"investigations carried out by MI5 to date suffer from serious procedural deficiencies\" and that \"we cannot rely on their conclusions\".They said it would be \"premature\" to decide whether to begin contempt of court proceedings against any MI5 officers before a new investigation took place.Sir Ken previously said the service would co-operate fully with the new inquiry.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul Glynn,Culture reporterandIan Youngs,Culture reporterBest-selling children's author and comedian David Walliams has denied allegations of inappropriate behaviour after being dropped by his publisher HarperCollins UK.A spokesperson for HarperCollins said it had decided not to release any new titles by Walliams \"after careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO\".The Telegraph says it follows an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women. HarperCollins did not confirm the reasons for its decision.A spokesperson for Walliams said he had \"never been informed of any allegations raised against him\" by his publisher.\"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice,\" the spokesperson added.The publisher said it took employee wellbeing \"extremely seriously\" with \"processes in place for reporting and investigating concerns\". \"To respect the privacy of individuals we do not comment on internal matters,\" the company said.Walliams is one of the UK's most successful children's authors, having sold more than 60 million copies worldwide in 55 languages.HarperCollins published his first children's book, The Boy in the Dress, in 2008. Some of his books, including Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy, have also been adapted into television films.He has published more than 40 books in total, including a Christmas book titled Santa & Son, which was published by HarperCollins in October.Two of his books - Mr Stink and The Boy in the Dress - have been adapted into TV films, which are scheduled to be broadcast on CBBC on Sunday.Walliams is also scheduled to appear on comedy panel show Would I Lie to You? on Boxing Day.A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"While we're not making any changes to the festive schedules, we have no future projects directly involving David Walliams.\"Walliams first rose to fame on TV sketch series Little Britain and has also won National Television Awards for his work as a judge on Britain's Got Talent.He was made an OBE in 2017 for his services to charity and the arts.But he has faced controversies including being criticised after appearing to make two Nazi salutes during a recording of BBC comedy panel show Would I Lie To You? this summer.In 2022, he apologised and admitted making \"disrespectful comments\" about two Britain's Got Talent contestants during a break in filming.He left the programme that year and sued the production company over the leaking of the remarks, reaching a settlement with them in 2023. HarperCollins UK appointed Kate Elton as its new chief executive in October.",

    "body": "6 hours agoCarrie Davies,BBC Pakistan correspondentandAnna LamcheFormer Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the hearing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case.He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.The jewellery case, referred to as Toshakhana 2 in Pakistan, concerns a Bulgari jewellery set given to Bushra Bibi by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a state visit in 2021, according to court documents. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items go to Pakistan's Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians are able to purchase the items back.Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewellery set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.In addition to their jail terms, the pair were handed a fine of over 16 million Pakistani rupees (£42,600).Khan was also convicted in an earlier, different Toshakhana case - but he challenged that conviction, meaning his sentence is suspended until the outcome of his appeal. He also has other cases outstanding against him.These include terrorism charges relating to violent protests that took place on 9 May 2023, when he was previously arrested.Khan was Pakistan's prime minister until April 2022 when he was ousted in a vote of no confidence.Although he has not been seen in public, his social media accounts have continued to operate with messages attributed to him on X often appearing after jail visits.These have been highly critical of Pakistan's current government and its politically powerful army Chief Field Marshall Asim Munir, including posts calling him a tyrannical dictator.In November, he was denied any visitors for nearly a month.After campaigning by his family and party, his sister was allowed to visit in early December; a few hours after she saw him, his account posted a comment credited to Khan calling the Field Marshall Asim Munir a \"mentally unstable person\". Khan has not been allowed any family visits since.The judgement states the judge was lenient in sentencing because of Khan's \"old age\".Update: This story was updated to clarify the latest legal status of Khan's earlier, separate Toshakhana case.",

    "body": "16 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

But it is all worth it for our Hazlitt audience.\"Mr Wood said he was armed with nothing but Dame Sherie Trifle's recipe book, filled with his lines, an outrageous wardrobe and a performance degree from Canterbury Christ Church University.\"I did train to be a performer when I was at university, but I wasn't expecting my stage debut to be in a dress,\" he said.The senior technician ended up starring in all of the theatre's weekend performances of Dick Whittington & His Cat.Dan BaughPantomime dame Joe Meloy fell ill and was unable to perform at the Hazlitt Theatre in MaidstoneAudience member Rachel Gadd said: \"As someone who has seen a fair few pantomimes in their day, I can safely say this was the best show I've seen.\"Of course, the show was fabulous on its own, but with the wonderful James standing in, it really added another layer of charm. \"I think the act of stepping up and helping people out is really what Christmas is all about.\"Director and producer Martin Cleverley, on behalf of Parkwood Theatres, added: \"In over a decade of producing panto, the Hazlitt has never seen their light operator step in for the panto dame.\"2026 will see a new special clause that sees all technical staff add panto understudy to their job role.\"Professional dancer Brad Wright also stepped in for Jared Leathwood in the title role of Dick Whittington that night, while fellow professional dancer Luke Baugh stepped in for Emmanuel Duarte as Idle Jack earlier in the run.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "12 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentGetty ImagesGeorge has been brought to the Passage charity by his father Prince WilliamThe Prince of Wales has brought his 12-year-old son Prince George to help at a homeless shelter, so he can teach him about homelessness and show him the efforts of organisations trying to tackle it.Prince William took his son to a charity with a deep personal connection - the Passage, in Westminster - where William had been brought as a child by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.This handing on of the torch took place last week, with George helping to make lunch for people being supported by the Passage, which works with homeless people in central London.Prince George signed a visitors' book using the same page signed by William and his grandmother Diana in December 1993.THE PASSAGEPrince William first visited the Passage with his mother Princess Diana when aged 11Mick Clarke, chief executive of the Passage, said Prince George had come when they were preparing Christmas lunch for 150 people.\"So it was really about, 'Are you ready to roll up your sleeves and get stuck in?' And he very much was,\" said Mr Clarke.\"Very much like his dad, actually - just wanted to get stuck in and help,\" said the charity chief.\"A lovely kid is how I would describe him, and he just really seemed very interested in the work that we do and particularly in talking to people who have used our services,\" said Mr Clarke.There was some competition between father and son in getting the food ready.\"William was on the sprouts, getting his sprouts ready so they could go into the steamer, and Prince George was helping with the Yorkshire puddings,\" said Mr Clarke.He described the signing of the book with Princess Diana's name as a \"lovely, beautiful moment - I think particularly with Prince William pointing out to George, 'This is my mum's signature. This was the first time that she brought me here.'\"It kind of felt full circle, really - 1993 through to 2025, with William bringing George,\" said Mr Clarke.The charity head said it seemed as though Prince George's family were trying to show their children life outside the palace and how it was important that \"the most vulnerable in society are supported and looked after\".And in terms of contrasts, the visit to the homelessness charity came on the same day as the annual Royal Family Christmas lunch in Buckingham Palace.THE PASSAGEA young William playing chess at the Westminster-based charityPrince William has been a supporter of the Passage since he was brought as an 11 year old by his mother, who had made regular visits, both public and private.William is running his own campaign to tackle homelessness, Homewards, and he has described his early experience of visiting the Passage as an inspiration.He remembered being anxious about his first visit with Princess Diana, but finding an unexpected warmth and happiness.\"My mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone,\" he said in an interview last year.\"I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone's not got a home, they're all going to be really sad.\"But it was incredible how happy an environment it was,\" recalled Prince William.The Passage, which takes its ethos from the social reformer St Vincent de Paul, has been working in Westminster since 1980, and last year helped more than 3,000 people who were facing homelessness.The charity says poverty is one of the main causes and \"many people are just one bill away from experiencing homelessness\".It also warns of risk factors such as addiction and substance abuse, mental health problems, domestic violence and traumatic events in families.The Passage has also highlighted links between homelessness and people being exploited in human trafficking and modern slavery.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiRoyal correspondentUS Department of JusticeA photo of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lying on the laps of women is among the thousands of Epstein files which have been released by the US Department of Justice.In the picture, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell hovers in the background smiling at the former prince. The photo appears to have been taken in the saloon room at Sandringham, the royal estate in Norfolk.The emergence of the photo will add to scrutiny on Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, after he was stripped of his remaining titles and honours over his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.Two of the photos also show Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, in the company of women whose faces are covered by black squares.Ms Ferguson's representatives declined to comment.Simply appearing in the photos or documents is not evidence of wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeSarah Ferguson is pictured in some of the photosThe heavily-redacted tranche of some of the so-called Epstein files - the long-awaited documents relating to the US Department of Justice's investigations into Epstein - were released on Friday night.The documents were highly anticipated after Congress passed a law mandating the files be released in their entirety by 19 December.They contain photos of the interiors of Epstein's homes, his overseas travels and celebrities including US President Bill Clinton, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Michael Jackson. President Donald Trump was hardly mentioned in the files.Many of those identified in other releases, including President Trump, have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.In the undated picture of Andrew, the former prince - now 65 - looks much younger. He is smiling with his eyes closed.The faces of those with him, who are sitting in front of a grand fireplace, have been redacted with black squares. The photo appears to be at Sandringham, King Charles's private estate in Norfolk.In another picture, he appears to be at Royal Ascot with Epstein and Maxwell.US Department of JusticeJeffrey Epstein, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell appear to be in the royal box at AscotAlso among the files are undated photos of Maxwell standing outside the door of 10 Downing Street.In the picture she is alone and no context was provided with the photo about why she is there or when the image was taken.US Department of JusticeThe issue over Andrew’s friendship with Epstein has continued to dog the royals.The King stripped his younger brother of his prince title following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the paedophile financier.He is also expected to shortly move out of his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge.It came after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - as he is now known - gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York, after more questions and allegations about his private life.At the start of this year, emails showed that he had stayed in contact with Epstein for longer than he had previously admitted.In a posthumous memoir published in October, Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always strenuously denied the claims.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities. He had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.Separately, two photos of Ms Ferguson - then the Duchess of York - have emerged in the document dump.One shows her standing on a pavement next to an unidentified woman holding a shopping bag. In the other, she is sitting cross legged on a green sofa.US Department of JusticeMs Ferguson has also faced her own Epstein controversy earlier this year, after an email from 2011 revealed she called him her \"supreme friend\".Multiple charities dropped the then-Duchess of York as a patron or ambassador after the emergence of that email, in which she also seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.The extensive redactions have been criticised by Democrats for violating the transparency law.But the White House says the Trump administration is the \"most transparent in history\", as the DoJ says it has \"erred on the side of redacting to protect victims\".",

    "body": "A wildlife park has welcomed the birth of its second rhino calf in 2025, marking a rare success for the species in captivity.Cotswold Wildlife Park said the female, named Mo, was born to Ruby, a 19-year-old white rhino, earlier than keepers expected. She is Ruby's sixth calf with breeding male Monty and the 13th rhino born at the Oxfordshire park in the past 12 years.It is difficult to catch rhino births on camera as females usually give birth during the night but the quick-thinking team at the park managed record the unique moment.Her arrival follows the birth of a male calf, Markus, to another female, Nancy, earlier this year and the pair are the only white rhinos born in the UK in 2025.Across Europe, just six calves were born in 2025 and park curator Jamie Craig said: \"To have such a successful record breeding this incredible species is down to our team of dedicated keepers. \"A paddock full of rhino is a great sight and the new arrivals are certainly keeping the team on their toes.\"After some wobbly first steps Mo has already been delighting visitors with playful charges in the Rhino paddock.She has met some of her older sisters and will stay with her mother for at least two years, benefiting from her protection. Females guard their offspring aggressively and are intimidating adversaries if challenged.She was named in honour of Maureen Clifford, a long-serving member of staff who worked at the park for nearly four decades.Maureen, affectionately known as \"Mo\" to close friends, still visits with her family and is delighted that the new calf is named after her.White rhinos were once on the brink of extinction, with fewer than 50 animals remaining in the early 1900s. Thanks to conservation efforts, they are now the most common of the five rhino species, though poaching remains a serious threat.Cotswold Wildlife Park works with UK charity Tusk to support conservation in Africa and has raised more than £120,000 for the cause over the past decade.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJaroslav LukivUS President Donald Trump: \"We hit every site flawlessly\"The US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom – which directs American military operations in the Middle East, north-east Africa, central and southern Asia – said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), told news agency AFP that \"at least five members of the Islamic State group were killed\" in eastern Syria's Deir ez Zor province, including the leader of a cell responsible for drones in the area.Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency, announced the Royal Jordanian Air Force had participated in the strikes to \"prevent extremist groups\" from \"threaten[ing] the security of Syria's neighbours and the wider region\".IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to immediately verify the targets.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.US Air Force/ReutersA US Air Force photo handout shows a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft taking offIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

    "body": "Family raffles £325,000 seaside home for £5 a ticket rather than sell it6 days agoCatriona AitkenBBC WalesJennie BaileyJennie and John Bailey say they love the seaside flat, but the family are outgrowing it as sons Henry and Sebastian - and cocker spaniel Dylan - growJennie Bailey's friends thought she was \"bonkers\" when she told them she was raffling her family's £325,000 home for £5 a ticket.Her family has lived in what was originally their holiday home for two-and-a-half years after deciding to swap their lives in Manchester for the \"slower pace\" of the seaside village of Rhoscolyn on Anglesey.But the two-bedroom flat is becoming a bit of a squeeze for Jennie, her husband John, 45, their sons Henry, 11, and Sebastian, nine, and cocker spaniel Dylan.With the boys \"craving their own space\" and, after 12 months of having the property  on the market and dropping the original £365,000 asking price by £40,000, the family decided they could no longer sit and wait for it to sell.\"I was getting a bit stressed about it,\" said Jennie, 43.\"I thought 'let's think outside the box and try something a bit different'.\"The raffling of properties is legal, but must follow strict guidelines and regulations.The family's flat, which Jennie and John originally bought eight years ago as a holiday home, is one of three inside a converted house, with Jennie's brother owning the ground floor flat where their family stayed when Jennie was a child.\"I've been coming here since I was two. We spent all our summer holidays here, so I've kind of grown up here,\" said Jennie.She gets \"quite emotional\" at the thought of leaving but, after her father died last year, she realised it was time for a new chapter.Jennie BaileyJennie and John Bailey and their sons Henry and Sebastian turned their holiday home into their full-time residence nearly three years agoOne of Jennie's best friends sent her a link to an article about a woman in Ireland who raffled off her home and the idea stayed with her.\"My first response was 'don't be so stupid, there's no way in the world I'm doing that'.\"But curiosity got the better of me and I spent probably a month really researching it. I got loads of legal advice, which was really difficult to get because a lot of people just don't understand it.\"Michael SpeakThe two-bedroom flat is one of three properties inside a converted house by the beachJennie and John had to take the property off the market when they set up the raffle using an online platform.Tickets are £5 each and their goal was to sell 150,000 in six months, with a deadline of 1 January.Even if they do, they won't get £750,000 as 10% goes to the platform, as well as costs such as legal fees, stamp duty and marketing.As of Friday, the family had sold 50,531 tickets.If they don't hit their goal, they'll keep the property and the winner of the raffle draw will get half of the pot with the other half going towards covering costs, then the family can keep anything left.Jennie BaileyThe Bailey family have always enjoyed spending holidays by the sea, but decided to make the permanent move to Anglesey in 2023Which? Money has previously said entrants should pay close attention to terms and conditions, and that the number of failed housing raffles \"far outweighs the small number of successes\".Jennie said friends had told them about negative comments online and in person surrounding the raffle, including the cost of the flat and the fact they are not originally from the area, but \"I've just ignored it all\".She added: \"We're genuinely just a family who are trying to sell our property in a bit of an unusual way.\"It gives a chance for someone who might not be able to buy this kind of property - £5 is like a coffee these days.\"If you don't like it, just don't enter.\"Michael SpeakWhat started as a holiday home became a permanent residence when the family moved from ManchesterJennie said \"only a low percentage of people actually complete\" after doing this type of raffle, but she was staying optimistic as the latter stages of the raffle tended to be when more tickets were sold.She said the experience had been \"a complete learning curve\" as she had no idea how to approach marketing or the other skills needed before attempting it.\"I work on this every day. Some days all day long, sometimes at night,\" said Jennie, who also runs a handmade home decor business, while John works from home as a packaging designer.\"It's really hard. I don't know whether what I'm doing is right or not, I'm just literally trying anything and everything.\"Would I recommend it? If you can be quite thick-skinned and just carry on, then yes, do it. But you've got to devote time to it.\"Michael SpeakAs 11-year-old Henry and Sebastian, nine, grow up, they crave their own space, Jennie saysStelios Kounou, founder and CEO of global raffle technology firm Raffall, said the first house raffle on his platform took place in 2020 and, since then, it had hosted 54 UK and Ireland house raffle attempts, 18 of which had resulted in the property being exchanged.\"I don't see this becoming a trend,\" he said, adding house raffles were not something he had thought about when first setting up his company.\"People who do this know probability of success might be low but, for those willing to put in the hard work, the time risk is worth the possible reward.\"The Bailey family plans to stay in the area once they sell the property, but Jennie admits they'll miss the beach view.\"It would be amazing to see someone else enjoy this like we've done. \"More top storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "'The second home ban has breathed new life into my village' Just nowJo LonsdaleBBC North East and Cumbria InvestigationsBBCMany generations of Jennifer Hall's family fished out of a now largely empty Beadnell Harbour Nearly eight years ago, Beadnell on the Northumberland coast became one of the first villages in the country to ban any homes built on new sites being used as second homes or holiday lets. The number of permanent residents has increased, bringing what some say is \"new life\" but others argue the policy is not enough to save rural communities or think it an unwarranted attack on tourism.Driving towards Beadnell harbour, 75-year-old Jennifer Hall nods one by one at the large houses overlooking the sea.\"Holiday let, second home, second home, holiday let, second home, holiday let,\" she intones. Clustered barnacle-like at the end of a glorious arc of sand, Beadnell, along with the neighbouring villages of Bamburgh and Seahouses, has long been a magnet for those seeking refuge from the madding crowd. According to the 2021 census, 64% of homes in Beadnell are second homes or holiday lets, up from 55% in 2011.Almost every house on Beadnell seafront is a holiday let or second homeHall's family has been in Beadnell since at least the 1700s. \"Fishing folk mainly,\" she says, but her great-grandmother opened the village's first hotel, an irony not lost on her given her years-long campaign against over-reliance on tourism. \"I don't hate holiday lets and I don't hate second homes at all,\" she says.\"But, in winter when there are no lights on, it can be very lonely.\" For much of the last half century, planning policy encouraged tourism. As recently as 2016, a new estate of 40 houses, Bernicia Way, was completed with a legal condition they could only be used as second homes or holiday lets. \"We were thinking there would come a point when there was nobody living here at all,\" Hall says.Among its policies was a requirement that all homes built on new sites would come with a legal restriction that they could only be used as a permanent residence. Planning policies previously supported tourism so the 40 homes in Bernicia Way, completed in 2016, can only be used as holiday lets or second homesAn estate of 45 houses called The Kilns was built and it included nine homes designated \"affordable\" - available for a set amount below market rate. The policy has been positive, Hall says, with the number of residents \"up by more than 10%\". \"It's really brought new life,\" she says. \"We have several new clubs in the village, and a fantastic new playground.\" Homes on The Kilns estate can only be lived in as permanent residencesAmong the newcomers to The Kilns determined to get \"stuck in\" to village life are Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes, both in their mid-sixties.They host a new monthly wine club, have joined Beadnell volunteers and Priestley-Jayes has begun a book club.  Jayes is also on the parish council \"for my sins\", he says with a wry smile. \"There's so much going on,\" his wife adds.Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes have begun a book club and a wine clubHall accepts the policy is \"not perfect\". Some houses in The Kilns remain unsold, and rumours abound that a few are being used as second homes despite the legal restriction.\"There are definitely some people who don't appear to be using their houses as their permanent residence, which is a shame,\" Priestley-Jayes says. Northumberland Estates, which was behind the project, said responsibility for enforcing the planning condition rests with Northumberland County Council and pointed out the residency requirement was \"very clearly communicated throughout the sales and marketing process\". The council said it would be inappropriate to comment further as the situation was \"part of an active investigation\".A further problem is the policy only applies to new sites.\"We've had developers buy up an old house, knock it down and replace it with a bigger property which has become holiday lets,\" Hall says. \"So that's a frustration.\"We've built The Kilns but there's not much space for more new houses.\" The parish council made a map using red and orange dots for holiday homes to demontrate how they dominate BeadnellDespite this, other villages have followed Beadnell in adopting the same policy. Helen Coyne, 72, has a flat in one of them, Alnmouth, with panoramic, ever-changing views of another of Northumberland's seemingly endless beaches. Although this is her second home, she says she understands the rationale behind the changes, and accepts the doubling of council tax since April last year. But she thinks second home owners contribute a lot to local businesses. \"We're here at least two or three nights every week, I use the lovely gift shop, we go out for meals, we drink in the pubs,\" she says.\"When family and friends stay, they do that even more.\"Helen Coyne, who has a holiday home in Alnmouth, says she tries hard to support local businessesBut Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria, says some second home owners visit \"just a couple of times a year\". \"They're definitely not sending their children to local schools either,\" he adds. The Liberal Democrat's constituency includes part of the Lake District National Park where one in four properties is a holiday home.Farron wants to go even further than applying restrictions to new-builds and is advocating a change in planning law.\"If I wanted to change my house into a fish and chip shop, I'd have to apply for planning permission,\" he says. \"But if I want to turn it into a second home or a holiday let, I can just do that. But it has a material impact on the community I live in.\"He wants separate categories of planning use for holiday lets and second homes, which would allow local authorities to limit their numbers.\"That way we can ensure rural communities don't die.\" The Lake District National Park Authority hopes to build affordable homes available only as a principal residenceThe Lake District National Park Authority's head of development management, Andrew Smith, agrees the current tools it has are \"quite limited\" and school populations continue to decline.The authority has set a target for 1,200 new permanent homes by 2035 but has no control over what happens to the existing housing stock.\"All you can do is approve or refuse new houses and try and facilitate new housing coming forward,\" he says. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it knew \"too many second homes and holiday lets can be harmful for communities\" and was taking action.Councils had the power to charge more council tax for second homes and the ministry was \"removing the incentive for landlords to prioritise short-term holiday lets over longer-term homes\", a spokesperson said.\"We'll continue to monitor impacts on communities and consider more powers for councils where needed,\" they added.PATourism revenue for the Lake District in 2024 was £2.3bnHowever, Richard Sayer, a former director of the North-East estate agents Rook Matthews Sayer, is wary of anything that might reduce the number of visitors.  \"An elderly person living permanently in a village has a perfect right to be there but is not hiring paddleboards and kayaks, or going to restaurants,\" he says.\"A holiday let with six people, they're spending thousands every week which is all going into the local economy.\"He has a holiday property near Keswick in Cumbria and thinks the doubling of council tax on second homes is already causing some to sell up. \"What is really needed is accommodation for the staff who work in the tourist industry, not fewer holiday homes,\" he adds. \"Every business in Keswick seems to have a sign up saying they are looking for staff.\"PAMore than half the properties in the Northumberland village of Bamburgh are second homes or holiday lets Back in Beadnell, on the kind of grey blustery day when the rain pecks at your face, the Craster Arms has a steady stream of windbent visitors. Owner Michael Dawson, who employs about a hundred staff across three cafes and pubs - \"young people, local people\" - also has little time for policies which deter second homes and holiday lets. \"The gift shops, ice-cream parlours, fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants,\" he says\"Make no mistake, we all rely on them.\"  Publican Michael Dawson would like to see even more holiday lets and second homes in Beadnell What everyone agrees on is rural communities need more young families amid falling birth rates and an ageing population.    There are about 750 properties in Beadnell but no school and only about 20 children. Esther Graham, 46, grew up in the village but could only afford to live there with her children by moving in with her parents, who extended their home to accommodate. \"There's nothing for the kids, no clubs, no brownies or scouts,\" she says.Like Hall, her family have been in Beadnell for centuries but she worries about future generations. \"What we need more than anything is affordable housing and more jobs,\" she says. Esther GrahamEsther Graham grew up in Beadnell but says she can only afford to live there because she shares a house with her parentsNorthumberland County Council said the provision of affordable housing was one of its \"top priorities\" and it had updated its Housing Allocation Policy so council houses were only offered to people with \"a very strong connection to Northumberland\". It said, between 2017 and the end of 2025, more than 1,700 affordable homes had been built across the county and planning permission had been granted for 1,369 more.Related internet linksRelated stories",

He focused on the economy, immigration, the Democrats…. And the US men’s olympic hockey team.\nBut with growing voter dissatisfaction souring the polls, will Trump’s sales pitch be enough to counter sliding approval ratings and convince voters to stick with him for November's midterm election?\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter Watch: Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle says he passed information onto policeThe Metropolitan Police has apologised to the Commons Speaker for \"inadvertently revealing\" he was the source of information relating to Lord Mandelson's arrest on Monday.It comes after Sir Lindsay Hoyle confirmed he had passed on information to the force suggesting the peer could be a flight risk.Lord Mandelson's lawyers have complained about the Met's decision to detain him as part of its probe into misconduct in public office allegations.They say he had agreed to an interview next month, and the decision to take him into custody was prompted by a \"baseless\" suggestion he was planning to \"take up permanent residence abroad\".The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's lawyers were twice told by the police that information about his alleged travel plans had been passed on by Lord Forsyth, the Speaker of the House of Lords.On Tuesday evening, Lord Forsyth denied any involvement after he was initially reported as the source of the referral, calling the suggestion \"entirely false and without foundation\".On Wednesday, The Times then reported the information had in fact been shared by Sir Lindsay. Shortly afterwards, the Commons Speaker made a statement to MPs confirming he had given \"relevant\" information to the force.He told MPs he had done this \"in good faith\", considering it to be his \"duty and responsibility\". \"It is regrettable this rapidly ended in the media,\" he added.He did not provide any details, but the BBC understands Sir Lindsay passed on information he received in the British Virgin Islands during a visit last week that Lord Mandelson was planning to travel there.Senior officers from the Met met Sir Lindsay on Wednesday to explain the situation, which is regarded by the force as a serious breach of protocol.A spokesperson for the force said: \"The Met has apologised to the Speaker of the House of Commons this afternoon for inadvertently revealing information during an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office.\"The BBC understands the Speaker of the House of Lords has not yet received an apology from the Metropolitan Police.Lords sources said Lord Forsyth had arranged an urgent meeting with the Metropolitan Police on Thursday and was expected to receive clarification about how his name came to be mentioned.The sources said he wanted to know why, when the media was widely reporting erroneous information attributed to him, he was not contacted about the issue and the record was not corrected.Lord Mandelson's lawyers Mishcon de Reya have written to the Met asking what information and evidence they based their decision to arrest their client on.The force is understood to have conducted its own assessment of the credibility of the information passed on by Sir Lindsay before deciding to arrest Lord Mandelson on Monday afternoon.The former Labour minister was taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview, before later being released on bail pending further investigation. It is understood he surrendered his passport as one of his bail conditions.ReutersLord Mandelson pictured outside his home after police launched their investigation earlier this monthIt comes after the force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. Lawyers for the peer say he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\". Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.

    "body": "15 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporterGetty ImagesEmperor Penguins are likely more at risk from climate change than any other air-breathing Antarctic animal Scientists have discovered that an annual event when Emperor penguins completely shed and regrow their feathers is putting the birds in peril as Antarctica is transformed by a warming world.Each year the birds must stay on platforms of floating ice for long enough to replace weather-beaten feathers with new, waterproof coats.But in 2022-24 Antarctic sea ice shrank significantly, largely down to climate change, depriving the birds of safe places to moult.Now scientists who track the animals using satellite pictures can no longer find most of the birds. They fear that thousands of penguins may have frozen in Antarctica's icy waters.\"This was really an \"oh my God\" moment,\" says the scientist behind the findings, Dr Peter Fretwell at British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on Emperor penguins for 20 years.\"You could see this was something game-changing for Emperor penguins. Suddenly you're thinking, well, have we got time to save them?\" he says. The research, published in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment, provides evidence about the impacts of the collapse in Antarctic summer sea ice in 2022-24 which the BBC reported on here.It is focussed on West Antarctica, home to 30-40% of the global population of Emperor penguins. The animals are amongst the most threatened in the world. They migrate thousands of kilometres to find stable sea ice during Antarctic summer to wait out what is called a \"catastrophic moult\" every year. VantorOn vast white sea ice, the blobs of brown are feathers left behind by penguins as they moultLittle else was known about the 30-40 day moult, until Fretwell spotted large brown smudges in satellite pictures from 2019-2025. They turned out to be mounds of feathers, left in an area called Marie Byrd Land.The penguins' feathers are \"the most complicated and best insulating of any animal\", he says. Over time they are damaged, so the penguins shed them annually.\"It's incredibly energy-intensive and the birds use up to 50% of their body mass,\" he says.VantorScientists identified extensive mounds of brown feathers in satellite picturesIt is \"probably the most dangerous time for adult Emperor penguins because they haven't got their waterproof suits on,\" he says. If they go into water, they are likely to die.In 2019, 2020 and 2021 the sea ice was relatively stable and significant feather mounds were visible. But in 2022 summer sea ice in much of Antarctica dramatically shrank, falling from an average of 2.8m sq km to a record low of 1.79m sq km in 2023.That trend continued until 2025, when there was a modest recovery in the sea ice in West Antarctica.Getty ImagesResearchers fear that most Emperor Penguins colonies could be wiped out by 2100But when Fretwell looked at the satellite pictures, he saw few signs of the birds. \"There should have been lots of penguins there, but actually we could only see 25 groups,\" he said. Groups vary in size from 10s to up to 1,000 birds.\"Again this year the sea ice hasn't been too bad, but I can only see a handful of penguins really,\" he says.He fears most have could died. Some may have travelled to another location in East Antarctica to moult, but this would have disrupted breeding, also leading to population losses.Longer term, the bird's best chance for survival is to adapt to moult on shallow ice shelves. Fretwell has seen some groups begin to do this, although it may come with a cost to the penguins' breeding and feeding patterns.Peter FretwellHe says the findings are a reminder that while the effects of global warming can be slow at times, there are moments of dramatic change.\"It wasn't just a few colonies that were lost and it wasn't a slow process,\" he says.\"It is the only piece of science I've ever done that's really emotionally got me,\" he says.Next he will compare his findings with an imminent population count of Emperor penguins in the Ross sea region where the birds migrate to and from. That will give more data about the possible numbers of deaths.He says the results could change predicted extinction dates for Emperor penguins.\"Now I'm asking, is that coming forwards towards us? Is it the end of the century?\" he asked.",

But in real life I'm an absolute sweetheart.\" For about five seconds a poster for the James Bond film No Time To Die appears.McCullagh then appears back on screen and continues to play, telling viewers: \"I don't have too many loved ones in my life but the ones I do, I love with all my heart.\"Throughout the video, McCullagh tells the camera he is a \"very angry gamer\".Earlier, the jury of six men and six women were shown items removed from Natalie's home in the aftermath of her death, including a small black-handled knife found at the scene beside her.They were also shown a piece of paper, which contained information on diabetes, and a silver metal dog bowl, all found close to Natalie's body.Det Sgt Stewart held up the evidence to show the court and then it was passed to the jury to examine.The jury was also shown photographs from inside and outside the defendant's home and heard WhatsApp messages exchanged between Natalie and McCullagh in the days leading up to her death. In one message McCullagh said \"right I'm off to stream the night away\", to which she replied: \"Good luck, might have a sneak peek later.\"",

He denies all charges.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.Prosecutor Tom Little KC told the jury the defendant carried out a \"tsunami\" of abuse against Baird.But Katy Thorne KC, defending, later told the jury Trybus was \"never abusive to his wife\".\"This without question is a tragic case, a young woman has died and she took her own life and nothing you decide in this courtroom can alter the grief and loss of those who loved her,\" she said.Family handout Baird was 34 years old when she took her own life\"The defence position is he didn't beat her, he didn't break her, he didn't coerce her, control her and he didn't cause her death.\"On the contrary, he loved her and cherished her deeply and his case is that without anyone's knowledge, Tarryn Baird was making demonstrably false allegations to health professionals,\" she continued.Thorne told the jury Trybus's actions did not cause Baird's death.\"The defence case is that on a number of occasions Tarryn Baird made allegations of violence which were demonstrably false, for example, by reporting injuries to health professionals when Christopher Trybus was not even in the country.\"Health professionals were being told a false story and her boredom and troubled mind was leading her to make allegations to seek care and attention,\" she said.The jury also heard from Dr Tessa Jones who confirmed that she had seen Baird on multiple occasions and had more than 100 entries in her treatment notes.Baird had initially sought treatment in September 2015 for fainting episodes and cardiac concerns before she started to report suffering various injuries, the court heard.These included Baird stating that Trybus had sex with her \"against her will\" in October 2016, which is the basis of the first of the two rape counts.The court heard that Jones wrote in her notes that Baird had told her \"he put his hands around her throat, he started to strangle her\".Baird then managed to hit Trybus with a free hand but he proceeded to \"have sex against her will\" and \"during the altercation he also hit her around the head several times with an object, Tarryn thinks it's her phone\".The court heard the GP continued to state that Baird \"doesn't think she will ever be able to escape the situation, has suicidal thoughts\".The trial continues.More from Wiltshire",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorPA MediaOn the day households found out their energy bills would fall in April, the Chancellor chose to go to the headquarters of the company that has quietly become the UK's biggest domestic energy supplier, Octopus.Rachel Reeves was shown the screens displaying the real-time management of energy demand for electric vehicles, as well as the cheaper prices for the communities that had volunteered to host clean energy infrastructure such as wind farms.This was an attempt to not just illuminate the notable cut to energy bills announced under the Ofgem price cap, but also to start to float a broader story about the UK economy, after some rosier numbers in recent days.I asked a couple of times, if she was seeing \"green shoots\" in the economy. Eventually she said that we were \"beginning to see the economy turning a corner\".\"I think this will be the year that people start to feel the change in their pockets,\" Reeves said.Is that right, or could that prove a hostage to fortune?The 7% cut to electricity bills is real and substantial (though it's worth noting that energy bills remain stuck in a higher band than before the Russia Ukraine energy crisis four years ago).This has been a very conscious strategy from the Chancellor. She spent Autumn actively looking for ways to use policy and the tax system to lower inflation.\"I know that the last few years have been tough for people, but the measures that I took, all fully costed and fully funded in the budget, should start to ease those cost of living pressures that people have been living with for too long,\" she told me.Digital advertising hoards currently plastered with adverts for the \"Big Rail Fare Freeze\" are part of the same strategy. Reeves told me that energy companies should all pass on the £150 cut to every customer, even those who had fixed their bills.The cut is unusual as it does predominantly come from the Government's decision at the Budget to shift the burden of green levies from bills into general taxation.That is important. But it is also true that at that Budget, Reeves also announced she would extend the freeze on income tax thresholds which effectively means more of peoples' income will be taxed at higher rates as their pay increases.We've also seen some sluggish economic growth numbers at the end of last year, and increases in unemployment especially for younger workers.But more generally we have seen better figures for high street spending, economic surveys of the service sector, consumer confidence, and lower borrowing numbers and costs.Inflation had already begun to fall even before today's energy bill cuts. In turn, interest rates set by the Bank of England are also set to continue to fall.It may be a little too early to call \"green shoots\", but it is also the case that the doom mongering about the UK economy has been overdone too.So the Chancellor is trying to use this moment of a tangible cut to every household's energy bill as a launching pad for a wider attempt to gee up consumer and business confidence. The official independent forecast numbers for the economy, prices, borrowing and jobs come next week at the Treasury Spring Statement, which should give us a clearer picture of just how green the economic shoots are expected to be.",

    "body": "Aldi shop staff to receive two pay rises this year1 hour agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAldi is now the fourth-most popular supermarket in the UKAldi has announced its second wage increase for floor staff since the new year, as it vies to increase its market share in the UK.The budget supermarket will pay its store assistants £13.50 per hour from April — just a month after an increase is due to take effect in March.Staff in London will be paid £14.88. Both rates increase with length of service.Lidl GB, Waitrose and Sainsbury's all announced above-inflation pay rises for staff earlier this month.Aldi said the wage increase will benefit 28,000 staff members, and says it makes its entry-level workers the highest paid of all supermarket staff, including its fellow budget chain Lidl.The legal minimum wage will rise to £12.71 an hour in April 2026. Some employers voluntarily pay a higher rate called the Real Living Wage, which is calculated by the Living Wage Foundation, a charity. The current Real Living Wage is £13.45.John Lewis shop staff, including those working in Waitrose, will receive a pay rise on 1 April, bringing their hourly rate to £13.25, or £14.80 in London.Sainsbury's has also announced a pay rise, bringing its rate to £13.23 and £14.54 for London workers.Lidl staff will be paid £13.45, or £14.80 in London, from 1 March. Until Aldi's announcement of a second wage hike, this made Lidl the highest-paying supermarket in the UK outside of London.Aldi also claims it is the only major supermarket to offer paid breaks to all staff.Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said the company knows that \"every single member of Team Aldi is fundamental to our success and deserve nothing less\".\"Our colleagues work incredibly hard to deliver exceptional value for our customers, and we're rewarding that dedication with the highest pay in the sector.\"The cost of groceries soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy prices. Own-brand products, which make up most of the goods on Aldi and Lidl shelves, now make up more than half of everything shoppers buy, by value.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentReutersChip giant Nvidia reported its fourth quarter revenue jumped by 73% compared to the same period a year ago to $68.1bn (£50.2bn) - a record haul for the company.The revenue figures beat analyst expectations and come amid a wave of investor scepticism towards the massive amounts of capital being spent on artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\"Computing demand is growing exponentially,\" boss Jensen Huang said. \"Our customers are racing to invest in AI compute — the factories powering the AI industrial revolution and their future growth.\"While providing chips for companies across the AI sector, in recent weeks Nvidia has also laid out plans to generate demand with new technologies of its own.The company reported total annual revenue of $215.9bn for the past fiscal year, and has projected a rosy outlook for the months ahead.Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly-traded company, with a market cap of around $4.8tn.It has become a central player in the buildout of AI infrastructure, providing sophisticated chips to leading AI model developers including OpenAI and Meta.Gene Munster, manager partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said that buildout was likely to continue for a long time.\"AI is accelerating faster than people not using these tools can grasp,\" Munster wrote on the social media platform X on Wednesday. Critics have raised the spectre of \"circular financing\" deals in which investments by Nvidia in other companies may be clouding perceptions about how robust AI demand really is.Meanwhile, the company has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China.The outlook released by Nvidia on Wednesday did not include expectations about chip revenue in China.Last month, the Trump administration began allowing Nvidia to sell its H200 chips - Nvidia's second-most advanced type - to Chinese customers under certain conditions.But this week, a US Commerce Department official told lawmakers that none of those chips have yet been sold to Chinese customers.Nvidia is also expanding its own product line in a bid to have more involvement in the physical products in which AI is embedded.Last month at the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars.Huang said the open-source AI model, which the company is calling \"Alpamayo,\" will bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.Nvidia also said is was planning to launch a robotaxi service by next year in partnership with an unnamed partner.Nvidia chips have lead in the training of AI models, but it has faced of onslaught of competition in inference, the process whereby a trained model is applied to real-world data to generate answers through reasoning.During the fourth quarter, Nvidia acquired rival Groq in a $20bn deal that's expand its expertise in inference.",

    "body": "UK government denies Chagos Islands deal is paused, despite minister's comment9 hours agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealThe government has said there is \"no pause\" in its Chagos Islands deal despite a minister earlier telling MPs that the UK was \"pausing\" the process of passing the legislation to transfer control of the territory to Mauritius.A government source said \"there is no pause, we have never set a deadline and timings will be announced in the usual way\".Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer was answering questions from MPs when he said the UK was \"pausing\" the process while \"discussions\" happened with the United States.The move comes after US President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the deal last week, despite earlier expressing support for the treaty.The Chagos Islands - officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory - are located in the Indian Ocean and Britain has controlled them since the early 19th century.The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the territory to Mauritius, and pay an average cost of £101m a year to lease back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island.The UK is in the process of passing legislation to ratify the deal and on Wednesday, Falconer faced questions about that in the House of Commons.\"There was support from the US administration for this treaty, which has not changed,\" Falconer said.\"There clearly has been a statement from the president of the United States more recently, which is very significant. \"And as I told the house [of Commons] we are now discussing those concerns with the United States directly. We have a process going through Parliament in relation to the treaty.\"We will bring that back to Parliament at the appropriate time. We are pausing for discussions with our American counterparts.\"In earlier comments in the Commons, Falconer said the deal was going \"through Parliament in the normal way\".\"We are pausing in discussions with the United States,\" Falconer said. \"And those discussions continue.\"Earlier, the prime minister's spokesperson told reporters the UK's position had not changed and the focus was on \"discussions with the US on next steps\".Mauritius's Attorney General Gavin Glover said he was not surprised by the minister's comments.\"There has been no discussion on the legislative process for the last three weeks,\" Glover.\"I note that it says a pause from the legislative process and not a backing off. \"I am in close contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\"The deal has been thrown into doubt by President Trump, who last week posted on his Truth Social platform to urge Sir Keir to not \"give away Diego Garcia\", home to the UK-US military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and called the deal \"a blight on our great ally\".The comments came despite the US Department of State giving its official backing to the UK government's plan a day earlier.The US State Department said it had nothing to add, following Falconer's comments in the Commons.Legislation delayedThe Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill is designed to enshrine the Chagos Islands agreement into UK law.It is in the final stages of its passage through Parliament and is currently in the House of Lords.A debate on the bill was pulled in January after the Conservatives - who have long opposed the deal - tabled an amendment calling for a pause \"in light of the changing geopolitical circumstances\".The bill has not been on the order paper in the Lords since then and no date has been set for the next stage.Last week, Politico reported that the legislation would be delayed but Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones said it would return to the Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Opposition pressureBritain has controlled the Chagos Islands since 1814 and evicted its inhabitants in the 1960s to make way for the military base on Diego Garcia.The islands became formally established as an overseas territory in 1965, after the British government paid Mauritius a £3m grant to retain the archipelago.Last year, the UK government agreed to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius, arguing the future of the military base had been threatened by recent international court decisions.Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base.Many Chagossians see the deal as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland.The Conservatives and Reform UK are staunchly opposed to the deal as well.MPs from those parties have been travelling to Washington to lobby American politicians, in a campaign aimed building opposition to the agreement in the US.Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Reform UK MP Nigel Farage said there was \"no basis, historically, culturally, in any way, for Mauritius to have a claim on those islands\".He said the region could \"finish up with a turf war going on between India and China in the region\".Farage claimed the Maldives were about to issue a counter-claim to the International Court of Justice over the Chagos Islands in \"just a few days\".\"If anybody has the right to the sovereignty of those islands, it is the Maldives and not Mauritius,\" Farage said. \"And I would urge you to pause all of this.\"Shadow foreign minister Wendy Morton said the Chagos deal would leave Britain \"weaker, poorer and less safe\". \"This is not a legal necessity,\" Morton said. \"It's a political choice made by a floundering prime minister and it's British taxpayers who are left to pay the price.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoEleanor LawsonWest MidlandsGetty ImagesAston Martin's net losses jumped 52% in 2025 to £493.2mAston Martin has confirmed it will be axing 20% of its workforce, with the firm's net losses jumping 52% last year to £493.2m. The luxury car firm, synonymous with James Bond, has struggled for several years and blamed US president Donald Trump's tariffs in a statement made last month.Aston Martin, which has its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, employs about 3,000 people, meaning job losses will total around 600.The firm said the job cuts should deliver annual savings of around £40m and did not specify when the job cuts would be implemented, but said most of the savings would be made this year.A spokesperson for Aston Martin said US tariffs had been \"extremely disruptive\" and demand had also been \"extremely subdued\" in China, the world's biggest auto market.It has also trimmed its five-year capital spending plan to £1.7bn from £2bn by delaying investment in electric vehicle technology.Aston Martin said: \"Having undertaken at the start of 2025 a process to make organisational adjustments to ensure the business was appropriately resourced for its future plans, we had to take the difficult decision at the end of 2025 to implement further changes.\"This latest programme will ultimately see the departure of up to 20% of our valued workforce.\"It is understood the majority of cuts will impact the UK, where the bulk of Aston Martin's workers are based, with roles across the business being impacted, including factory staff.The company also has a UK site in St Athan, south Wales, as well as worldwide offices and dealerships.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporter andMax MatzaWatch: \"I'm not going to speculate\", says Marco Rubio on Cuba boat shootingFour people who entered Cuban waters on a US-registered speedboat have been shot dead by border guards, Cuba's government said. In a statement, Cuba's interior ministry said that the speedboat's passengers opened fire on a coast guard vessel that approached them. Six additional passengers were wounded in the incident, which took place near an island on Cuba's northern coast. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the nationalities of those on board is unclear, and that the US will \"make determinations based on the facts. Right now we're still gathering facts.\"He said the boat was not carrying US government personnel.Cuba's government said it did not know the identities of those on board the vessel, nor what it was doing in the area, and that an investigation has been launched to \"clarify\" the event. In statement posted on X, the ministry said the Florida-registered vessel - with the registration number FL7726SH - was detected near Cayo Falcones, in the country's central Villa Clara province on Wednesday morning. When a Cuban boat carrying five members of the ministry's border guard approached the vessel for identification, \"the crew of the violating speedboat opened fire\" and wounded the Cuban commander, the statement said.\"As a consequence of the confrontation, as of the time of this report, four aggressors on the foreign vessel were killed and six injured.\"Those injured were evacuated and given medical assistance. Rubio, spoke from Saint Kitts and Nevis, where he had travelled to meet with Caribbean leaders amid the Trump administration's push to ramp up pressure on Cuba's government, as well as other regional issues. \"It is highly unusual to see shootouts on the open sea like that. It's not something that happens everyday,\" Rubio told reporters. \"We're going to find out exactly what happened, who was involved, and we'll make a determination on the basis of what we find out,\" he continued.He vowed that US investigators would move \"quickly\" to gather the key facts, and that the US Coast Guard has travelled to the \"vicinity\" of the attack.\"I don't know who has possession of the vessel. This is the first thing we want to have,\" he said.\"We obviously want to have access to these people, if they are American citizens or US residents.\"But he added that the US would not rely on information provided by the Cuban government, and that Washington would independently verify the facts of the case.  The incident comes amid increased tensions between the US and Cuba, which is facing a deepening fuel crisis that has been worsened by the US blocking oil shipments from Venezuela, a long-standing ally in the region, to the island.Getty ImagesLawmakers call for investigationThe Cuban statement alluded to these tensions, saying that \"in the face of current challenges, Cuba reaffirms its determination to protect it territorial waters\" and safeguard its sovereignty. On Wednesday, the US Treasury said it would ease some small private sector transactions, including oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people, for commercial and humanitarian use\".It also happened one day after Cuban-American groups in Miami commemorated the 30th anniversary of the Brothers to the Rescue shootdown, which killed four people.Wednesday's incident sparked several Florida lawmakers to call for an investigation and to criticise the Cuban government.Florida Congressman Carlos Gimenez, a Cuban-American former mayor of Miami, said he would demand an investigation into what he called a \"massacre\".He added that US authorities \"must determine whether any of the victims were US citizens or legal residents\". Florida Congresswoman María Elvira Salazar said on social media she was following the situation and \"awaiting further details from US authorities\".James Uthmeier, Florida's attorney general, said he would direct local law enforcement to investigate the incident. \"The Cuban government cannot be trusted, and we will do everything in our power to hold these communists accountable,\" he said. In the US Senate, Florida Republican Rick Scott, demanded \"a full investigation into this deeply concerning situation and to determine what happened.\" \"The Communist Cuban regime must be held accountable!\" he added.US Vice-President JD Vance said the White House was \"monitoring\" the situation.\"Hopefully it's not as bad as we fear it could be,\" he said at an unrelated event in Washington.\"But I can't say more because I just don't know more.\"This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

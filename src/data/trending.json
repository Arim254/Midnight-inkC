The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome.

    "body": "7 hours agoKwasi AsieduandOsmond ChiaThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, according to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.It is the first pill of its kind to receive approval from the regulator, marking a new era for weight-loss drugs.Wegovy's Danish makers Novo Nordisk said the once-daily pill was a \"convenient option\" to the injectable and would provide the same weight loss as the shot. It comes after Wegovy was approved by the FDA specifically for weight loss.Others like Ozempic, which has similar weight-loss effects, were primarily approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.The BBC has contacted the FDA for comment.The Wegovy pill showed an average weight loss of 16.6% during Novo Nordisk's trials, the firm said on Monday.A third of around 1,300 participants experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the same trial, it added.The pill is expected to be launched in the US in early January 2026.\"Patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection,\" said Mike Doustdar, the firm's chief executive.The pill version of Wegovy could give Novo Nordisk's sales a boost after a challenging year which saw its shares slide as it warned over its profits.The company has faced intense competition in the weight-loss market from rival drugmakers like Eli Lilly.Novo Nordisk's shares rose by almost 10% in after-hours trade in New York after the announcement.",

    "body": "Vince Zampella, who co-created the widely popular video game series Call of Duty, has died in a car crash in California, aged 55. Zampella's death was confirmed by Electronic Arts, which owns Respawn Entertainment, a game studio he co-founded.The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the  BBC.Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. Both people inside the vehicle died. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film.The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legend.\"He really cared about the player experience, he cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor told BBC Newshour.In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012.At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty.Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\".\"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe Daily Star pays tribute to singer Chris Rea who has died aged 74. Rea, known for his song Driving Home For Christmas among others, died after a short illness. The news came only days after he shared a post to Instagram from a car saying \"Driving home for Christmas with a thousand memories\", the paper reports.King Charles III is officially the \"hardest-working royal\" despite his \"battle with cancer\", according to the Daily Mirror. The paper hails him as \"King of Industry\" as it reports that the monarch clocked up 532 engagements this year, 330 more than the Prince of Wales.Police chiefs plan to scrap non-crime hate incidents after calling them no longer \"fit for purpose\", the Daily Telegraph reports. Police leaders have been warned current legislation threatens free speech and plan to replace them with a \"common sense\" approach.The Financial Times leads with London's West End busy with British shoppers buying last-minute Christmas presents. It reports on the hope that this festive season will generate some \"economic magic\" after recent years of \"weak growth, high inflation and political uncertainty\" impacting \"consumer habits\".The families and supporters of Palestine Action hunger strikers have pleaded with Justice Secretary David Lammy to meet them to end the protest, the Guardian reports. The protest has \"reached a dangerous stage\", the paper says, with the health of the strikers deteriorating.The i Paper leads with a young worker diagnosed with silicosis calling for a \"full ban on quartz-engineered stone\" to  \"save other men like me from killer kitchens\". Luke Bunker, 29, lives with the incurable lung disease.In a bid to save Britain's vibrant High Streets, post offices will be part of a revamp to \"lure shoppers back to town centres\", according to the Daily Express. Following the closure of banks, post offices have been picked to fill the void, the paper reports.The Daily Mail leads with a husband and five other men being charged with a string of sexual offences against his ex-wife over a 13-year period.Taxpayers will be kept in the dark about how much public money is being spent on union officials' paid time off, the Times reports. As part of the government's workers' rights reforms, Labour has scrapped powers to cap \"facility time\" and will not require the NHS and schools to declare it, the paper says. Elsewhere, under new animal rights reforms, boiling live lobsters and crabs will be banned, with the government saying it is \"not an acceptable killing method\".In a \"new blow\" for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the Sun reports that the former prince has had his gun licence revoked. The paper says he agreed to give up his licence after specialist police paid him a visit at the Royal Lodge.The Independent is calling for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to back the paper's bid to \"beat HIV by 2030\", urging him to lead the global fight against Aids which it says claimed 630,000 lives worldwide last year. In the top picture spot is a giant hole that opened up at a Shropshire canal after heavy rain, swallowing boats and leaving a huge trench.The Daily Telegraph claims that police chiefs will present the home secretary with proposals next month to scrap \"non-crime hate incidents\".  The paper says there have been warnings that recording the incidents has a chilling effect on freedom of speech, and diverts officers away from other investigations. The paper says the offence's exclusion from crime databases would mean any incidents would no longer have to be declared as part of job checks.The Sun reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has had his gun licence revoked, after a meeting with specialist police officers. The former duke of York will now be able to transport or use shotguns only while he is supervised. Sources told the paper he had sent a valet to speak with the Met Officers and had later surrendered his licences.According to The Times, the government's workers' rights reforms mean that taxpayers will not be able to find out how much public money is spent on union officials having paid time off work to perform their duties. Last year's figure was £107m, but the paper says the government has scrapped plans to cap that number, and public bodies - like schools and hospitals - no longer have to declare it.The Financial Times says Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, failed to stop hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through accounts which had been deemed suspicious - despite promising to improve its conduct in a criminal settlement two years ago. Binance has told the paper it has robust systems in place and zero tolerance of illegal activity.Many of the front pages feature photos of Chris Rea, who has died aged 74. The Daily Mail pays tribute to the musician, saying he \"hated the rock star lifestyle\". The Star calls him an \"icon\". The Guardian talks admiringly of Chris Rea as a \"fame refusenik who never took the easy road\", releasing a 137-track blues album in 2005. The Daily Mirror references his seasonal hit, Driving Home For Christmas, saying \"today the road feels lonelier, but he carries us home\". The Express recalls him winding his windows down in festive traffic jams, to serenade fellow stuck drivers with the song.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA top Amazon executive has said the US technology giant has blocked more than 1,800 job applications from suspected North Korean agents.North Koreans tried to apply for remote working IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, Amazon's chief security officer Stephen Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post.\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" he said, adding that this trend is likely to be happening at scale across the industry, especially in the US.Authorities in the US and South Korea have warned about Pyongyang's operatives carrying out online scams.Amazon has seen a nearly one-third increase in job applications from North Koreans in the past year, said Mr Schmidt in his post.He said the operatives typically work with people managing \"laptop farms\"  - referring to computers based in the US that are run remotely from outside of the country.The firm used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and verification by its staff to screen job applications, he said.The strategies used by such fraudsters have become more sophisticated, Mr Schmidt said.Bad actors are hijacking dormant LinkedIn accounts using leaked credentials to gain verification. They target genuine software engineers to appear credible, he said, urging firms to report suspicious job applications to the authorities.Mr Schmidt warned employers to look out for indicators of fraudulent North Korean job applications, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and mismatched education histories.In June, the US government said it had uncovered 29 \"laptop farms\" that were being operated illegally across the country by North Korean IT workers.They used stolen or forged identities of Americans to help North Korean nationals get jobs in the US, said the Department of Justice (DOJ).It also indicted US brokers who had helped secure jobs for the North Korean operatives.In July, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in jail for running a laptop farm to help North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at more than 300 US companies.The DOJ said the scheme generated more than $17m (£12.6m) in illicit gains for her and Pyongyang.",

    "body": "Chris Rea: The car enthusiast whose love of driving inspired his songs17 hours agoEmma PetrieGetty ImagesChris Rea: \"Most of the songs are different people's love stories inside cars\"Rock and blues singer Chris Rea spent countless hours on the road, and his love of cars and driving was the inspiration behind many of his songs. He recorded 25 solo albums, two of which topped the UK albums chart. His distinctive gravelly voice and slide guitar-playing are preserved in songs such as Road to Hell, Auberge, On the Beach and Driving Home for Christmas.Christopher Anton Rea was born in Middlesbrough in the north-east of England in 1951 to an Italian father and Irish mother and was one of seven children. The family was known locally for Camillo's Ice cream factory and cafes, owned by his father Camillo Rea.Driving Home for Christmas singer Chris Rea dies aged 74Chris worked in the cafes as a teenager and took his driving test in one of his dad's ice cream vans. When he was asked to do an emergency stop, the examiner fell off the box he was sitting on and cut his leg. Rea said: \"I had to take him to the hospital but he still passed me.\"He was still working for his father when he bought his first guitar, a 1961 Hofner V3 in his early 20s.Rea said that at the time he was \"meant to be developing my father's ice cream cafe into a global concern, but I spent all my time in the stockroom playing slide guitar\".Getty ImagesChris Rea: \"The road always becomes a metaphor for where we are going in life.\"He played with local groups The Elastic Band, and Magdalene, but it was The Beautiful Losers which shone the spotlight on Rea, and he secured a solo recording deal with Magnet Records.His first studio album was Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?, released in 1978. The lead single, Fool (If You Think It's Over), was a big hit in the US, reaching number one on the (adult) contemporary singles Billboard chart, earning him a best new artist  nomination at the Grammy Awards.Michael Levey, co-founder of Magnet records, remembers him as \"more of a thoughtful, introspective poet than a natural pop performer\".One of Rea's childhood dreams had been to write and compose music for films. He achieved both with his movie La Passione in 1996. Rea also wrote the score and title track for the Soft Top Hard Shoulder film and starred in the comedy Parting Shots in 1999.Getty Images\"Music and cars fit together very well\" Rea explainedRea was building a reputation for his slide guitar playing when his record company insisted on releasing Driving Home for Christmas in 1986. He said: \"I didn't need a Christmas song hanging around at that point. I did everything I could to get them not to release that record. Thankfully they did!\"The song's inspiration dates back to a difficult year for him personally.  In 1978 Rea had come to the end of his record contract and had parted ways with his manager. The record company wouldn't pay for a train ticket for him to get from London to his home to Middlesbrough so his wife drove down to pick him up in her old Austin Mini.On the way back up, it started snowing and they kept getting stuck in traffic and Rea said: \"I'd look across at the other drivers, who all looked so miserable. \"Jokingly, I started singing - We're driving home for Christmas... then, whenever the street lights shone inside the car, I started writing down the lyrics.\"Getty ImagesRea began learning to play guitar at the age of 21\"It's one of those moments that songwriters get - sometimes you can spend years and years writing. That one was five to 10 minutes. When you have a successful song, you don't remember thinking about it - it just comes out.\"He didn't sing the song live until December 2014 after his crew badgered him to do it. He hired 12 snow cannons and let them off during the song.\"We put three feet of artificial snow in the stalls. The venue charged me £12,000 to clean it up!\"Getty ImagesRea released his first solo album in 1978Bad traffic on the intersection between the M4 and the M25 was also the inspiration for Road to Hell.Rea's musical journey was brought to a temporary stop when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer aged 33.He had a procedure which resulted in the removal of part of his pancreas, the duodenum, the gall bladder and part of his liver. He was also a type 1 diabetic and had problems with his kidney.His health problems made him reassess his career - he never toured America despite his popularity.  \"I was never a rock star or pop star and all the illness has been my chance to do what I'd always wanted to do with music,\" he said.In 1997, that included recording Let's Dance with his good friend Bob Mortimer for Middlesbrough Football Cub's FA Cup Final. In one of Mortimer's appearances on the BBC's comedy series Would I Lie to You, Mortimer claimed that Rea cracked an egg into a bath for him after they'd finished recording it at his studio. The clip about whether that was a truth or lie went viral.Rea was happy to admit that he was a vehicle addict with a huge love of cars, and travelling in them helped inspire some of his music. He owned and raced various vintage cars including a 1957 Morris Minor 1000 police car. He was friends with Eddie Jordan, owner of the Jordan Formula 1 team, and once helped out in the pit lane.\"I had the whole uniform. He put me in charge of the tyre-warmer for the rear right tyre of Eddie Irvine's car\".Getty ImagesRea on his European tour of Road Songs For Lovers in 2017In 2016 he suffered a stroke, but still recovered enough to record and tour his 24th album: Road Songs for Lovers.Rea said he spent an awful lot of time on the road travelling to London.  \"I see couples in cars - are they married, workmates, having an affair?\" he mused.The musician liked to write about the simple things in life: \"You get ideas for songs and you're actually on a road - the road always becomes a metaphor for where we're going in life,\" he once said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHelen Catt,Political correspondentandGeorge WrightLocal Government Secretary Steve Reed has written to all council leaders in England warning them not to introduce four-day working weeks.As reported by the Telegraph, the letter is understood to say that \"council staff undertaking part-time work for full-time pay without compelling justification would be considered an indicator, among a wide range of factors, of potential failure\".He added that he hoped he had made the government's policy \"unambiguously clear to all councils\". A Labour source said \"Voters deserve high standards and hard work from local councils, and seeing council staff working a four-day week just won't cut it.\" \"They should get on with the job and make sure residents get the best service possible five days a week,\" the source added.In the letter to the councils, which was reported by The Telegraph, Reed says that local authorities should not be offering \"full-time pay for part-time work\".Reed previously expressed his \"deep disappointment\" in the first UK council to adopt a four-day working week.South Cambridgeshire District Council, which is led by the Liberal Democrats, became the first to make a permanent move to a four-day week in July after it began trialling a shorter working week in 2023.Reed said there had been a decline in performance in the council's housing service and he sked how the local authority would \"mitigate\" this.The government can intervene in any council if it is deemed to be failing.Last year Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also rejected civil servants' demands for a four-day working week.Critics of a four-day week say it would reduce productivity and slow economic growth but others disagree. A trial in the Scottish public sector this year found an increase in productivity and improvements in staff well-being.The Autonomy Institute, which was commissioned by the Scottish government to co-ordinate the pilot, found that 98% of staff judged morale and motivation to have improved.",

    "body": "'A miracle': Officer shot in head during Bondi attack home from hospital2 hours agoYang TianSydneyPA MediaJack Hibbert had been working as a police officer for just months before he was shotA young police officer who was shot in the head during the Bondi Beach attack has been released from hospital.Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert - who is just four months into the job - was patrolling a Hanukkah event when two gunmen opened fire, injuring over 40 people and killing 15.The 22-year-old, who was also hit in the shoulder, has lost vision in one of his eyes but is now recovering at home, his family confirmed in a statement.\"As a family, we couldn't ask for anything more - having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle.\"They thanked the public for their \"overwhelming support\" and praised medical staff for their \"exceptional\" care and dedication.\"While he is home, he is still recovering and will need space, support, and continued positive thoughts during this time,\" the statement added.Even after he was shot during the attack, Constable Hibbert continued to help festival attendees until he physically couldn't, his family previously said.\"Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack's bravery during the incident... They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "2025 likely to be UK's hottest on record, says Met Office34 minutes agoMark PoyntingClimate researcherEPAThis year is on course to be the UK's hottest since records began, according to the Met Office, as climate change continues to drive temperatures to new heights. With just over a week still to go, the average UK air temperature across 2025 is on track to end up at about 10.05C.A cooler Christmas could affect final figures, but it is likely that 2025 will edge out the current record of 10.03C from 2022, the Met Office says.Along with a lack of rainfall, the persistent warmth left the country vulnerable to droughts and wildfires through the spring and summer, with temperatures peaking at 35.8C. While temperatures vary naturally from year to year, scientists could not be clearer that human-caused climate change is driving the UK's rapidly warming trend.Longer spells of hotter days and nights driven by climate change will pose an increased risk to elderly and vulnerable people, Met Office scientist Mike Kendon has said.Mr Kendon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would also have an impact on the agriculture sector, influencing which crops farmers are able to grow in the UK.By the end of 2025, the UK's 10 warmest years on record will all have taken place in the last two decades, in measurements going back to the late 1800s.\"Anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change is causing the warming in the UK as it's causing the warming across the world,\" said Amy Doherty, another climate scientist at the Met Office.\"What we have seen in the past 40 years, and what we're going to continue to see, is more records broken, more extremely hot years [...] so what was normal 10 years ago, 20 years ago, will become [relatively] cool in the future,\" she told BBC News.The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year follow the long-term December average. As a result, the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, but it is the most likely outcome. It would be the sixth time this century that the UK has set a new annual temperature record, following 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014 and 2022.\"The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th Century,\" said Mr Kendon.The expected new record of 2025 has been built on persistent heat through the spring and summer.Those long, hot, sunny days may feel like a distant memory as we head towards Christmas, but both spring and summer were the UK's warmest ever recorded.Each month from March to August was more than 2C above the long-term average between 1961 and 1990.And while temperatures may not have reached the peaks of 40C seen in July 2022, hot spells happened repeatedly.Four separate - albeit relatively short-lived - heatwaves were declared across much of the country. The UK Health Security Agency also issued several heat-health alerts through the summer.Spring and summer were also marked by low rainfall. Spring was particularly dry - the UK's sixth driest since 1836. Combined with the warm weather helping to dry out the soils, this lack of rainfall pushed large parts of the country towards drought. Through the summer, official droughts were declared across several regions in England and Wales, by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales respectively. Parts of eastern Scotland also entered \"significant water scarcity\", according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.Recent rainfall has eased the situation across much of the country and most areas are no longer in official drought. But water levels are still below average in some places.\"There's a huge deficit to be made up, and there's a huge implication, not just for people who are farming the land [and] growing food, but our rivers, our aquifers, our availability of drinking water,\" said Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.The repeated swings between drought and flooding were making it very hard for communities to adapt to increasing weather extremes, she added.The prolonged dry, warm weather created ideal conditions for wildfires too.By late April, the area of the UK burned by wildfires had already reached a new annual record, according to data from the Global Wildfires Information System going back to 2012.More than 47,100 hectares (471 sq km or 182 sq miles) has now been burned throughout 2025 - smashing the previous high of 28,100 hectares of 2019.As the UK continues to heat up - driven by humanity's greenhouse gas emissions - scientists expect the UK to experience more weather extremes. \"The conditions that people are going to experience are going to continue to change as they have in the last few years [with] more wildfires, more droughts, more heatwaves,\" said Dr Doherty.\"But also it's going to get wetter in the winter half-year, so from October to March [...] the rain that does fall will fall more intensely, and in heavier rain showers, causing that kind of flooding that we've been seeing this year as well,\" she added.The UK has not been alone in experiencing extreme heat this year. The world is on course for its second or third warmest year ever recorded, according to the European Copernicus climate service.But the international consensus on tackling climate change is also being tested, with the US and some other leading producers of fossil fuels rowing back on their net zero commitments.

    "body": "Image source, Getty Images / ArterraByBen RichLead Weather PresenterUpdated 6 hours agoCold weather is going to arrive across the UK over the next few days - just in time for the festive season.But if you are dreaming of a white Christmas you may end up disappointed as the chances of snow on the big day are looking very slim.High pressure will build meaning a lot of dry weather with no widespread rain or snow.It is not impossible that a few flakes of snow could fall over high ground in the far south or far north of the UK, which would make it a white Christmas in technical terms - but even this seems quite unlikely.Cold air arrives from the eastDecember so far has been mild and wet in most places, and this week started with more cloud and rain - and temperatures above the seasonal norm.However, this is now beginning to change as high pressure takes hold across Scandinavia.This will drift across the northern half of the UK over the next couple of days and along with low pressure to the south, will bring a feed of chilly easterly winds.Image caption, Easterly winds will be strongest in southern parts of the UK on Christmas DayOn Tuesday, and for a time on Christmas Eve, there will be a lot of cloud which could produce some drizzle.This will begin to break, initially in western and southern areas, as drier air begins to arrive.These cloud breaks will allow for a frost in some areas on Christmas morning - perhaps the closest we will get to a winter wonderland.It also means many areas should see some festive sunshine, especially in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a little more cloud lingering in parts of Scotland.Daytime highs on Christmas Day will reach 4-7C (39-45F). This is nothing exceptional for the time of year and not far off the seasonal average, but it will mark a significant change after a mild month so far.Strong winds in the south of the UK will exacerbate the cold feel.Those winds will ease on Boxing Day with most areas seeing dry weather and sunny spells, although it will still feel chilly.Will it be a White Christmas?Join BBC Weather’s Carol Kirkwood, Matt Taylor and Barra Best, along with famous faces Jeremy Vine and Lucy Porter, to explore where our fascination with a white Christmas comes from.Could it be a white Christmas?Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult.It requires two key elements - cold air and precipitation - and the latter ingredient will be lacking as high pressure keeps the weather dry in most places.This will be welcomed in areas which have recently seen heavy rain such as Cumbria and south Wales.A few computer weather models have hinted at a little wet weather pushing across the Channel Islands and fringing into the far south of England.If this was to happen it could mean a little sleet or snow mixing in over the very highest ground, but the chances of this are extremely low.Most of us will see a chilly, bright Christmas but not a white Christmas, and you can check your local festive forecast on the BBC Weather website and app.What is a white Christmas?The definition of a white Christmas is just a single snowflake recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 weather observing stations.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day does not count.An \"official white Christmas\" has happened more often than not since 1960, but new analysis of Met Office data by the BBC shows that snow falling on Christmas Day is rare for most of us - and getting rarer.The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations and, very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.",

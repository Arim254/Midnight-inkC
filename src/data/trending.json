    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identify theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people - including from his own family members, was serving his sentence at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey. He was released on Friday night, US media report.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

Although it took a few years, she decided to study again with the Open University while recovering from a car accident.\"I had a bit of time to spare and I thought I'd like to do something,\" Ms McFarland told BBC News NI.Studying online had proved a challenge at times. However, she said her family - including her four children, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren - had been \"wonderful\".\"I'm very bad online but I had a lot of help from the family,\" she said, adding that her daughter-in-law taught her how to type. \"I know they're there if I want them and they help me in every way they can.\"But, you know, I think they think for granny to have a degree, it's a bit odd!\"Ms McFarland also said she had a \"lovely\" tutor who provided \"a lot of support\". 'It's never too late'Her eldest daughter Shauna Gailey accompanied her mother to the graduation ceremony in the Waterfront Hall.\"I am just so proud of her,\" Ms Gailey said.\"She is a B.A. undergraduate full-on at the age of 90, that's just so exciting for her and for the rest of us.\"She's always regretted not finishing the Trinity Dublin degree, we all knew that, but she had four children, she had a busy life and all the rest of it.\"Ms Gailey said her mother had really thrown herself into her studies. \"She used to sit on her sofa, surrounded by piles of books, with her laptop and tablet in front of her,\" she recalled.All of the family came to Belfast \"for a big family lunch\", before watching Maryette graduate.And Maryette had a message for anyone who thinks they are too old to learn new things.\"If I can do it, anybody can do it.

    "body": "5 hours agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

    "body": "4 hours agoCalum WatsonBBC ScotlandGetty ImagesThe Honolulu Harbour Board wanted the ship removed so it could redevelop the harbourA historic Clydebuilt sailing ship has been towed out to sea off the coast of Hawaii and deliberately sunk, prompting outrage from maritime conservation groups.Falls of Clyde, built in 1878, had been moored as a museum ship in Honolulu since the 1960s but had fallen into a poor state of repair. The Honolulu Harbour Board confirmed it had the ship towed into deep water about 25 miles offshore on Wednesday and then scuttled.The news has been met with anger and dismay by campaigners who have spent more than a decade trying to bring the ship back to its birthplace to rebuild it.Falls of Clyde was the first in a series of eight iron-hulled ships built in the late 19th Century by the Port Glasgow shipbuilder Russell & Co.The ship spent many years carrying various cargoes to and from the Far East and Australasia before moving to Hawaii. Hawaii Department of TransportationFalls of Clyde was towed out of Honolulu Harbour at dawn and scuttled in deep waterIn the early 20th Century it had steel tanks fitted and was converted into a tanker to carry paraffin to the islands, where it later became a floating fuel depot before being acquired by a museum in Honolulu. But the ship was badly damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s, the maritime section of the museum closed down and for years it has been left slowly decaying.Enthusiasts in Scotland have spent a decade trying to bring the ship home for restoration, but were unable to reach an agreement with the harbour board which wants to redevelop the quay where it was moored.  The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the operation to remove the ship began at dawn on Wednesday and it was sunk about 25 miles south of the harbour. It said the vessel's name, wheel and bell were retained along with other artifacts which will be put on display.'A day that will go down in infamy'The destruction of the historic ship has been widely criticised by maritime conservation groups both in the UK and the USA. Friends of Falls of Clyde, a group of supporters in Hawaii, described it as \"a day that will go down in infamy\". \"It is almost inconceivable that this situation has been allowed to happen,\" the group posted on social media.The group organised a farewell ceremony with bagpipers on Tuesday after learning that the ship was to be sunk the following morning. The Tall Ship Glenlee, the charity that looks after another Clydebuilt sailing vessel moored beside Glasgow's Riverside Museum, said it was \"deeply saddened\".David O'Neill, from the Scotland based Save Falls of Clyde campaign, said he was \"horrified\" at the behaviour of the authorities in Hawaii but had become resigned to the ship meeting such a fate after years of fruitless negotiation. A 19th Century oil painting of Falls of Clyde when it sailed in the Far EastHe first became involved in efforts to rescue the ship in 2015 when someone in Hawaii alerted him to its condition, prompting him to post an appeal on social media saying: \"Old Scottish lady needs a lift home.\"A Norwegian firm which operates heavy lift ships offered to transport Falls of Clyde back to Scotland for free, but the campaign was soon embroiled in a wrangle with the harbour board over insurance costs and other conditions. Earlier this year Mr O'Neill said an American firm won a contract to remove the ship from the  harbour and it also offered to transport it to Scotland for free.\"They didn't want to sink the ship - they had a conscience and a respect for maritime heritage,\" he said. But the deal between the firm and the harbour board fell through, and the contract went instead to another company which then carried out the scuttling. The Hawaii Department of Transportation has been contacted for comment. Getty ImagesFalls of Clyde was part of a maritime museum for decades before it fell into decayMr O'Neill said he had seen a video showing the final moments of Falls of Clyde. \"She was towed out of harbour looking really elegant and stunning for a 147-year-old ship, unaided, not needing any pumps,\" he said. \"She was still afloat and for us that's representative that she was truly Clydebuilt.\"He said he found watching the ship go down \"quite disturbing\". \"She goes down by the stern and most of the ship lifts out of the water, like in the Titanic movie.\"The businessman is now concentrating his efforts on trying to bring home a Clydebuilt ship from a different era - the Type 21 frigate HMS Ambuscade. The warship was built for the Royal Navy at the Yarrow shipyard in Glasgow in the 1970s, and saw action in the Falklands War.  It later sold to the Pakistan Navy where it served until it was decommissioned two years ago. Mr O'Neill said he secured the frigate for free after making a \"cheeky request\" to the Pakistani government, and he is working on plans to return it to the Clyde to become a museum ship. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoBernd Debusmannat the White House andJohn SudworthKyivPresident Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have come away empty-handed from a White House meeting after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Zelensky said after the cordial bilateral talks that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".Following the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.The Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.Zelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy. While Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal. \"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding: \"I think we're fairly close to that.\"He described the weapons as \"a big deal\" and said that the US needed them for its own defence. He also said that supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine could mean a further escalation in the conflict, but that discussions about sending them would continue. Asked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"The Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.Zelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky was asked by a reporter outside the White House if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest. \"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".Asked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"The Ukrainian leader also appeared to suggest he would be amenable to Trump's suggestion of stopping the war along the current front line.\"We have to stop where we are, he is right, the president is right,\" Zelensky said. He added that the step after that would be \"to speak\". He later posted on X, saying that he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".While Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks in recent days, Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.On Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary - although no date has been set.Asked by a reporter on Friday if he was concerned Putin might be playing for time by agreeing to a new summit, Trump said: \"I am.\"\"But I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well. So, it's possible, a little time, it's alright. But I think that I'm pretty good at this stuff. I think that he wants to make a deal,\" he said.When asked by another reporter whether Zelensky would be involved in the prospective talks in Budapest, Trump - who was sat beside the Ukrainian president  said there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy. \"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\". The US president said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.Trump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Back in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.When the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".But he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\"",

    "body": "Donald Trump is the \"only one who can force\" Russian leader Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table over the war in Ukraine, Finland's president has told the BBC.Alexander Stubb also said that Finland would never recognise occupied Crimea as part of Russia, and that he wanted to ensure Ukraine became an EU and hopefully Nato member once the war was over.BBC Radio 4's Today programme spoke to President Stubb ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, where he told the US president: \"I think we can end this war with your help.\"Meanwhile, Trump said that Putin has agreed to meet face-to-face with him in Hungary.The US leader said on Friday that Putin \"wants to get it ended. I think that President Zelensky wants to get it ended. Now we have to get it done\".Zelensky said in the White House that Ukraine was ready to talk in any format and wanted peace, but argued that Putin needed to be \"pressured\" into ending the war.In August, Trump and Putin met in Alaska for a summit that did not result in a breakthrough, or yield a further meeting involving Zelensky.Stubb said Trump had once asked him - over a game of golf - whether he could trust Putin; and Stubb's answer was no. \"What we need is not so much the power of the carrot to convince Russia to the negotiating table, it's more of the stick that will bring them. \"So you have to force Russia to come to the negotiating table for peace and that's the deal President Trump is trying to make.\"He said Trump \"has been giving the carrot to President Putin, and the carrot was in Alaska, and of course now if you look at the language that he has put forward lately, there has been more stick\".Stubb was optimistic about Trump's ability, saying he believed peace negotiations had probably advanced more in the past eight months during Trump's second term than in the previous three years.In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territoriesRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Stubb said Finland would never recognise Crimea, or the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk, as Russian. Russia controls 70% of Donetsk and nearly all of neighbouring Luhansk.He said \"the only ones who can decide on the land issue are the Ukrainians themselves\".\"I want to make sure that Ukraine, when this war is over, retains its independence, retains its sovereignty - in other words becomes an EU member state and hopefully a Nato member - and also maintains its territorial integrity. That is what we are all fighting for right now,\" Stubb said.Trump said in August that there would be \"no going into Nato by Ukraine\" as part of a peace deal.The US president previously floated the idea that there may be some \"land swaps\" in a future peace deal, but then, in September, said Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".When asked why Trump had apparently changed his tune, Stubb said it was because Russia was not advancing - seizing only 1% of Ukrainian territory in the past 1,000 days. Ukraine had also been able to push back, he said.Trump is 'the only one who can force' Putin to negotiating table, Finland's president tells BBCStubb said Russia's economy - smaller than Italy's - was suffering, with the country's reserves depleted, growth \"pretty much around zero\", and inflation raised to between 10% and 20%.Stubb said economic threats should be used to bring Russia to the table, most importantly giving €200bn (£173bn) worth of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine as a loan that would stay there if Russia did not pay compensation after peace negotiations.He also wanted to see exports of Russian oil and gas to Europe - which have dropped by 80% - cut off. Sanctions could be put on countries that buy Russian oil and gas, he said, in addition to the 19th European sanctions package targeting Russia.Stubb said \"all the strategic games of Putin have been an utter failure\". Russia had been unsuccessful in trying to take over Ukraine, to divide Europe and to split Nato, with two new members - Finland and Sweden - added instead.He said Europe's \"coalition of the willing\" was ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, with the key help in the air, on the seas and with intelligence.But they needed a backstop from the US, specifically in air defences, intelligence and operations, he said.Stubb said he hoped to see some results from a two-phase peace process - the first a ceasefire to stop the killing and the second an extended peace process - \"in coming days and weeks\". \"We'll keep on working at it. The key is to engage and try to find solutions and be pragmatic. In foreign policy you always have to deal with the world as it is, not what you would wish it to be, but let's do peace.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaPrince Andrew has faced growing pressure over his links with Jeffrey EpsteinPrince Andrew is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, he has announced in a personal statement.He has been under increasing pressure over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with calls for Buckingham Palace to take action against him.That now seems to have resulted in the prince deciding to voluntarily hand back his titles and to give up membership of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.In his statement he said he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".\"In discussion with the King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" said a statement from Prince Andrew.\"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.\"I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"His decision to stop using his titles was made in consultation with William, Prince of Wales, as well as the King.He will remain a prince - but will cease to be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth.Prince Andrew had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.He is expected to stay in his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, on which he has his own private lease which runs until 2078. His ex-wife will be known as Sarah Ferguson and no longer Duchess of York, but their daughters will continue to have the title of princess. The prince has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including a court case he settled with Virginia Giuffre, questions about his finances and his involvement with an alleged Chinese spy.There had been growing frustration in Buckingham Palace at the scandals that continued to surround the prince.ReutersPrince Andrew speaks with King Charles at the funeral of Katharine, Duchess of Kent, in September Next week a posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, will be published. It is likely to cast further attention on Prince Andrew's involvement with her and Epstein.Ms Giuffre claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.She alleged that the prince had sex with her at his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London in 2001, when Ms Giuffre was 17 years old.Her memoir describes two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Prince Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.The prince made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him. He denies all the accusations made against him. 'It's a joyous moment' - Brother of Prince Andrew accuserSpeaking to BBC Newsnight following the announcement that Andrew was giving up his titles, Ms Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts said the news had brought mixed emotions, but that his late sister \"would be very proud\" of the development.\"We have shed a lot of happy and sad tears today. I think happy because in a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia,\" he said.\"All the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice, and these monsters can't escape from it - the truth will find its way out.\"He said this was \"a moment where survivors are not staying quiet any more\".\"It's just a joyous moment for them because we're finally getting some sense of acknowledgement, like 'this actually happened, what we're saying is the truth',\" Mr Roberts added.He said there was \"so much more to be accomplished, especially here in the United States\".Mr Roberts said he thinks anybody implicated \"should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors\", and that he would welcome any contact adding from the King or members of parliament.Prince Andrew has faced intense scrutiny over his links with disgraced financier Epstein, more recently including questions about when he had really cut off contact.In a now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019, Prince Andrew said that he had severed all links with Epstein after they had been photographed together in New York in December 2010.But emails sent in February 2011 later emerged suggesting that he had privately stayed in touch with Epstein, including sending a message that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\"Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight in 2019Epstein accuser Haley Robson told BBC Newsnight it was a \"bittersweet\" moment.Ms Robson said Ms Giuffre \"started this fight and we're going to see it through\", adding that \"I really wish that she could have been here to see all of what she started\".\"Having him [Prince Andrew] step down and be stripped of his titles is something that is long delayed, and it is very appropriate, and kudos to King Charles,\" Ms Robson said.But royal biographer Andrew Lownie argued the \"statement should have come from the King\".Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said a \"firmer line should have been taken\".Mr Lownie, who wrote Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, said: \"If Andrew was putting his duty to his family and his country first, he would have moved out of Royal Lodge years ago and would have actually stood down many years ago.\"Andrew withdrew from Royal Family events last Christmas after an alleged Chinese spy who he was linked to was named in a High Court judgement.His office said nothing sensitive had ever been discussed with Yang Tengbo, also known as Chris Yang, who became a close advisor on Andrew's business ventures.In 2022, Andrew was repeatedly named in a court dispute between a Turkish millionaire and her former business adviser.There were no suggestions of wrongdoing by the prince, but the court case highlighted the prince as receiving payments in a complex set of financial deals. A gift of £750,000 was returned to the Turkish millionaire by the prince.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentGetty ImagesAfter so many scandals, Prince Andrew has given up the use of his titles and honours.He can no longer sign off as the Duke of York, or put \"KG\", a Knight of the Garter, after his name, with a flourish of medieval chivalry. The Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh are also scratched off his list of titles, with \"Andrew Inverness\" a name he'd sometimes used in his business dealings.But what's caused this sudden announcement? Particularly as this dramatic move, removing the remaining vestiges of his royal life, comes with an assertion of his innocence and that he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".PA MediaPrince Andrew will no longer be at the Order of the Garter ceremoniesPrince Andrew has voluntarily given up the use of his titles - but he was clearly under pressure to jump before he was pushed.This way, the changes in his status are kept in-house and there doesn't have to be the intervention of Parliament, which would have needed to legislate to take away his title as Duke of York.That would have been messy, but the Palace was already sending signals it was prepared to take action, and it was confident that Parliament, and popular opinion, would have supported such a change.Allowing Andrew to voluntarily give up his titles, which theoretically remain in place, gave him a way out, still holding on to a little of the disappearing vapour trail of his pride.But it's no secret that Buckingham Palace was exasperated with the scandals surrounding Prince Andrew and what a royal source calls the \"constant parade of headlines\". He was one of their \"Dukes of Hazard\" that kept making news for all the wrong reasons.Questions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were drowning out the work of the rest of the Royal Family. That was on top of unanswered questions about Andrew's finances and his connections to an alleged Chinese spy.ReutersPrince Andrew and King Charles at the funeral of the Duchess of Kent last monthNext week will see a historic state visit by the King and Queen to meet Pope Leo at the Vatican, and there was a deep irritation that such a solemn occasion was going to be overshadowed by lurid stories about Andrew and Epstein.According to royal sources, a \"tipping point\" had been reached and something had to be done. Arguably that should have happened earlier. But that would also have meant the Palace publicly accepting that it had a responsibility for Prince Andrew, when it had so long argued that as a \"non-working royal\", his problems were his own to resolve.But this latest move shows a recognition that even if Andrew isn't a royal responsibility, it's still their reputation he's been damaging.What added to the sense of this no longer being a tenable position was an email published last weekend that showed Prince Andrew had stayed in touch with Epstein longer than he had claimed in his BBC Newsnight interview.Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight in 2019A royal source said this was a significantly different moment when there were such clear \"fault lines\" exposed in Prince Andrew's version of events.Curiously, the same email had been partially published in January - again showing that Andrew had not cut ties to Epstein when he had claimed - but this time in October the impact has been like the pebble that has started an avalanche.It followed a similar awkwardness for Sarah Ferguson, where a private email contradicted her own public claims to have cut links with Epstein.And it added to the pressure from extracts published from a posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein victim who had reached a financial settlement with Prince Andrew, and had earlier this year taken her own life.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre's memoir raises more questions about Andrew and EpsteinMs Giuffre's memoir, to be published next week, once again casts Andrew into toxic associations with Epstein.And the book's accusation that Prince Andrew was \"entitled\" echoed the title of a recent biography of Prince Andrew, by Andrew Lownie, that took another wrecking ball to his reputation.It's been a landslide of bad news, month after month, that showed no sign of losing momentum. He'd become the disastrous football manager, or the damaged political leader, who had no obvious way of being removed. Particularly when it was like a football manager whose brother was the chairman.There's always a tension between protecting an institution and a reluctance to remove the individuals within it. Even more so when the institution is also a family. It's where the Godfather movies meet the Crown.But something had to be done, and in the end, Andrew has handed back the keys to his royal life and walked away. More could still emerge in the United States in the trawling of documents related to Epstein.Ominously for Prince Andrew, among those quick to respond on Friday evening was the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee that has been pushing for the release of Epstein material.Robert Garcia, whose colleagues recently revealed documents showing an \"Andrew\" getting massages on Epstein's private jet, said: \"His decision to give up his royal titles is long overdue.\"\"We know rich and powerful men used their money and power to abuse girls and young women, and to shield themselves from justice. Prince Andrew's decision is just the beginning in the committee's work to deliver justice for the survivors.\"Prince Andrew has always denied wrongdoing but this has become a global story.When US President Trump arrived for his state visit, it was a picture of Andrew and Epstein that protesters projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle.Prince Andrew's decision to step away from his remaining titles will also mean he stays in step with his ex-wife, who is no longer the Duchess of York. They are back to where they began when they first met - as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.They still live together and as Prince Andrew has his own long lease on Royal Lodge, they'll carry on there as before. The King had already financially cut off Prince Andrew, so there isn't any change there, he'll have to find his own funding.But by voluntarily stepping back, rather than being stripped of their honours, it means that their daughters will carry on with the titles of princess.Prince Andrew won't be at the royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham this year. And the guessing game about seeing him at the Order of the Garter parade won't happen again.But are the questions about his conduct really over?",

    "body": "13 hours agoAshitha Nagesh, Sajid Iqbal and Kirstie BrewerUS Department of JusticeProsecutors said the weapons found on board Pahlawan's boat were \"some of the most sophisticated\" arms Iran producesA weapons smuggler who used a fishing boat to ship ballistic missile parts from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen has been sentenced to 40 years in a US prison.Pakistani national Muhammad Pahlawan was detained during a US military operation in the Arabian Sea in January 2024 - during which two US Navy Seals drowned.Pahlawan's crew testified they had been duped into taking part, having believed they were working as fishermen.The Houthis had launched sustained missile and drone attacks on Israel at the time, and targeted international commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, saying they were acting in support of Gazans. Iran has consistently denied arming the Houthis.The crew's detailed testimonies to a court in the US state of Virginia provide a rare look inside a smuggling operation that helped power the attacks.The components found on Pahlawan's boat were \"some of the most sophisticated weapon systems that Iran proliferates to other terrorist groups\", US federal prosecutors said after his trial.The 49-year-old was sentenced on Thursday, having been previously convicted on five counts - including terrorism offences and transporting weapons of mass destruction.Court documents show the sentences for two of the five counts will run concurrently for 240 months, or 20 years. The other three counts, another 20 years, will run consecutive to that - making a total of 480 months, or 40 years.'Walking dead person'The eight crew members who testified in court said they had no idea what was inside the large packages on board the boat, named the Yunus.One crew member said that when he questioned Pahlawan about it, he was told to mind his own business.Pahlawan, however, knew just how dangerous the cargo was.He referred to himself as a \"walking dead person\" in text message exchanges with his wife, sent in the days before the January 2024 voyage which would get him arrested.\"Just pray that [we] come back safely,\" said the message, used as evidence in court.\"Why do you talk like this, 'may or may not come back',\" she asked him.Pahlawan told her: \"Such is the nature of the job, my dear, such is the nature of the job.\"His final words to her before sailing were: \"Keep me in your prayers. May God take me there safely and bring me back safely, alright. Pray.\"US Department of JusticePahlawan used a fishing boat to smuggle Iranian-made anti-ship cruise missile components and a warheadFor this journey, Pahlawan was paid 1,400 million rials (£25,200; $33,274) - a substantial fee prosecutors at his trial described as \"danger money\".The trip was \"part of a larger operation\" funded and co-ordinated by two Iranian brothers, Yunus and Shahab Mir'kazei, said the then-US Department of Defense (now known as the Department of War) in a statement in June.The Mir'kazei brothers are allegedly affiliated, it added, with Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) - the most powerful armed force in Iran. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US.Both Shahab and Yunus Mir'kazei have been charged by the American authorities, but are still at large and believed to be in Iran.Pahlawan made two successful smuggling voyages before he was caught - one in October 2023, and a second two months later.The dozen men he recruited to join him were all from Pakistan and had travelled across the border into Iran looking for work.Before setting off on the December trip, the US court heard, the crew were tasked with loading large packages on to the boat in Chabahar on Iran's south coast.Then, after five or six days at sea, when they were close to the coast of Somalia, the crew described another boat pulling up next to them at night and them having to hand over the cargo.Crew member Mehandi Hassan told the court there were about five men on the other boat, who spoke in a language he didn't recognise.Their next voyage, the following month, was expected to follow the same route. As before, it began in the small port of Konarak before sailing to Chabahar, where the crew were made to load heavy boxes on board.The packages, the US Navy would later discover, contained Iranian-made ballistic missile parts, anti-ship cruise missile components and a warhead.US Department of JusticeNavy Seals Nathan Gage Ingram (l) and Christopher Chambers (r) both drowned during the mission to intercept Pahlawan's boatOnce at sea, Pahlawan kept to himself, according to crew testimony, often staying in his cabin and watching movies on his phone. Sometimes they would see Pahlawan on a second mobile - a satellite phone - but they didn't know what he was saying, said Mehandi Hassan, because he would speak in a language they didn't understand.On 11 January, the crew said they were woken by the sound of helicopter rotors overhead and a US Navy ship pulling alongside. Pahlawan came out of his cabin to tell everyone to \"keep going\" and not to stop the boat, telling them the ship and helicopters belonged to pirates.Armed US Navy Seals and Coast Guard officers attempted to board the Yunus. \"There was a lot of commotion,\" one crew member, Aslam Hyder, told the court.Special Warfare Officer Christopher Chambers lost his grip and fell into the water during the operation - and Special Warfare Officer First Class Nathan Gage Ingram jumped in to try to save him.Both men were so laden with equipment that they quickly drowned, an internal report later found. Their bodies were never found and they were declared dead 10 days later.The crew remained on the Yunus for two days before being offloaded to a US Navy ship, the court heard, where they were separated into two groups and held in windowless containers.Pahlawan ordered the crew to lie and to say the captain had already fled. \"He said, 'Don't tell them that I am the [captain], because I can do serious damage to you guys if you do that',\" Aslam Hyder told the court.\"He started to threaten us... It was about the family and the children, that they will not know about you and you won't know what happened to them,\" he said. \"Then we got very scared and we became quiet.\"One by one, said crew members who gave evidence, they were taken out of the containers to be interrogated individually. Everyone on board - including Pahlawan - was asked who the captain was and, according to US prosecutors, Pahlawan \"simply evaded, lied, and hid\".The American military said the packages found on board the Yunus were the first Iranian-supplied weapons to be seized by US forces since the Houthis had started attacking vessels in the Red Sea a few months earlier.But Pahlawan had been following a common route for smugglers carrying weapons bound for Yemen.Between 2015 and 2023, US forces and their allies seized almost 2.4 million pieces of ammunition, 365 anti-tank guided missiles, and more than 29,000 small arms and light weapons from small boats in the Arabian Sea, according to a UN report.Typically, smugglers use dhows - a type of small boat, often for fishing - to transport cargo close to the coast of Somalia.As with the Yunus, it is here that weapons are transferred to other, smaller boats, which then set sail to \"secluded beaches off the southern coast of Yemen… where they are then smuggled across the desert to Houthi-controlled areas of the country\", the UN Office on Drugs and Crime report says.US Department of JusticeAmong the cargo was this Iranian-made warhead, intended to form part of a ballistic missileWilliam Freer, from the UK think tank Council on Geostrategy, told BBC News that while most of the Houthi attacks have involved smaller weapons, the components found on Pahlawan's ship are \"a lot more complicated and can pack a lot more punch\".\"Very quickly, most shipping companies decided to redirect all their vessels, where possible, around South Africa rather than transiting through the Red Sea.\"This lengthy detour adds about 10 to 12 days of sailing time to each trip, and extra fuel, which previous analysis has estimated to cost companies about an extra $1m (£748,735) per round trip.Mr Freer added that the impact on commercial shipping has continued to this day.\"Within about two months of the initial attacks [in October 2023], shipping transiting through the Red Sea had dropped by about 60% to 70%, and it has stayed at that level ever since, even with the ceasefires,\" he told us.Even though Houthi strikes are now less frequent, he added, there are still \"just enough attacks to convince shipping companies it is not worth running the risk of returning\" to the Red Sea route.Iran has been accused by the US, UK, Israel and Saudi Arabia of smuggling missiles and other weapons to the Houthis by sea, in violation of a UN Security Council resolution since the armed group ousted Yemen's internationally-recognised government from much of north-western Yemen 10 years ago, sparking a devastating civil war. Iran denies this.On 5 June this year, Pahlawan was found guilty of conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists; providing material support to the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guard Corps' weapons of mass destruction programme; conspiring to and transporting explosive devices to the Houthis, knowing these explosives would be used to cause harm; and threatening his crew.\"Pahlawan was not only a seasoned smuggler,\" prosecutors said, \"he knew what he was smuggling and its intended use.\"In a final plea to the court for leniency, Pahlawan's lawyer wrote that life for Pahlawan's wife had long been estranged from her family because of her marriage to him, and that since his arrest, her and her child's lives had become \"extremely difficult and harsh\".\"Since the jury verdict, Mr Pahlawan's singular focus in their telephone conversations is the wellbeing of his family,\" his attorney said. \"He does not talk about himself or his fate. He cries with worry over what will become of his wife and child.\"But the court ruled that his high sentence was \"appropriate due to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\".",

    "body": "Mystery heatwave warms Pacific Ocean to new record13 hours agoMark Poynting and Matt McGrathBBC News Climate and ScienceKevin Carter/Getty ImagesPeople head to the coast in San Diego on a hot summer's day The waters of the north Pacific have had their warmest summer on record, according to BBC analysis of a mysterious marine heatwave that has confounded climate scientists.Sea surface temperatures between July and September were more than 0.25C above the previous high of 2022 - a big increase across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean.While climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long.But all this extra heat in the so-called \"warm blob\" may have the opposite effect in the UK, possibly making a colder start to winter more likely, some researchers believe.\"There's definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.Such a jump in temperatures across a region so large is \"quite remarkable\", he added.The BBC analysed data from the European Copernicus climate service to calculate average temperatures between July and September across a large area of the north Pacific, sometimes known as the \"warm blob\". The region extends from the east coast of Asia to the west coast of North America, the same area used in previous scientific studies.The figures show that not only has the region been warming quickly over the past couple of decades, but 2025 is markedly higher than recent years too.That the seas are getting hotter is no surprise. Global warming, caused by humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, has already trebled the number of days of extreme heat in oceans globally, according to research published earlier this year.But temperatures have been even higher than most climate models - computer simulations taking into account humanity's carbon emissions - had predicted.Analysis of these models by the Berkeley Earth group suggests that sea temperatures observed across the north Pacific in August had less than a 1% chance of occurring in any single year.Natural weather variability is thought to be part of the reason. This summer has seen weaker-than-usual winds, for example. That means more heat from the summer sunshine can stay in the sea surface, rather than being mixed with cooler waters below.But this can only go so far in explaining the exceptional conditions, according to Dr Hausfather.\"It certainly is not just natural variability,\" he said. \"There's something else going on here as well.\"One intriguing idea is that a recent change to shipping fuels might be contributing to the warming. Prior to 2020, dirty engine oil produced large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a gas harmful to human health.But that sulphur also formed tiny, Sun-reflecting particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols, which helped to keep a lid on rising temperatures.So removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.\"It does seem like sulphur is the primary candidate for what's driving this warming in the region,\" said Dr Hausfather.Other research suggests that efforts to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities has played a role in warming the Pacific too.That dirty air did a similar job to shipping in reflecting sunlight away, while cleaning it up could have had the unintended consequence of allowing more ocean heating.Possible impacts for the UK?The north Pacific's marine heatwave has already had consequences for weather on both sides of the Pacific, likely boosting very high summer temperatures in Japan and South Korea and storms in the US.\"In California, we've seen supercharged thunderstorms because the warm ocean waters in the Pacific provide heat and moisture,\" said Amanda Maycock, professor in climate dynamics at the University of Leeds.\"In particular, there are things we call atmospheric rivers… bands of air, which contain very high amounts of moisture that fuel themselves from the ocean waters,\" she added.\"So if we have warm ocean waters… they can then bring a lot of moisture onto the land, which then falls out as rain, or in the wintertime can precipitate out as snow.\"ReutersThe intense heat to hit Japan in August was likely amplified by Pacific Ocean heat, researchers sayLong-term weather forecasting is always challenging, but extreme heat in the north Pacific has the potential to affect the UK and Europe in the coming months too.That's because of relationships between weather in different parts of the world known as teleconnections.\"Although the current warm conditions are located in the north Pacific, these can generate wave motions in the atmosphere that can alter our weather downstream into the north Atlantic and into Europe,\" said Prof Maycock.\"That can tend to favour high-pressure conditions over the continent, which brings us more of an influence from the Arctic, where we have colder air,\" she added.\"That can be drawn over Europe and bring us colder weather in early winter.\"A colder outcome is by no means certain, as this is a complex area of science. Several other weather patterns also affect UK winters, which are typically getting milder with climate change.And a warm north Pacific appears to have different effects later in the winter, favouring milder and wetter conditions in some parts of Europe.Emerging La Niña in the tropical PacificAnother factor to throw into the mix is what's happening further south in the eastern tropical Pacific.There, surface waters are unusually cool - a classic sign of the weather phenomenon known as La Niña.La Niña, and its warm sibling El Niño, are natural patterns, although research published this week highlighted that global warming could itself impact the swings between them.Weak La Niña conditions are expected to persist over the next few months, according to NOAA, the US science agency.All else being equal, La Niña generally increases the risk of a cold start to winter in the UK, but also brings a higher chance of a mild end, the Met Office says.\"These two drivers in the north and tropical Pacific will be acting together this winter,\" said Prof Maycock.\"But since the La Niña is quite weak this year, the extreme warmth in the north Pacific could be more important for forecasting the winter ahead.\"Additional reporting by Muskeen Liddar and Libby RogersMore weekend picks",

    "body": "Beth Potter says she has felt less pressure this year as she seeks to clinch a second world triathlon title on Sunday.The British Olympic bronze medallist is joint leader with defending champion Cassandre Beaugrand of France before the final event in Australia.Potter admitted the build-up to the 2024 Paris Olympics and event itself took its toll.\"I was going in as one of the favourites to win Olympic gold and there was a lot of pressure and expectation on that one day,\" said the Scottish triathlete, 33.\"It was really hard and I felt like I could never really get into my groove last year.\"I struggled when I got off the bike to feel like myself running and it was really frustrating as there was no reason for it, because it wasn't like that in training.\"It just shows how much pressure I put on myself that year to come away with a medal. I don't think I've ever dug as deep as I did in that Olympic race to get that medal and it meant so much to me to just get the bronze.\"She won the World Triathlon Championship Series from Beaugrand in 2023 before roles were reversed last year.Potter has tried a new coaching set-up this year and spent nearly a month at altitude in the Swiss alpine resort of St Moritz.\"I just never found any part of my running easy last year and that was the one thing I always relied on to get myself out of trouble in races. It took me longer than I thought to recover off the back of that Olympic race,\" she said.\"Even just to enjoy doing triathlons again, it took me a good few months of off-season and getting back into the new season to actually think I wanted to be on the start line and race, and enjoy it. That was quite hard for me as it's my job, my livelihood.\"It's taken me a bit of time at the start of the year to get to grips with some new training and part of it was mentally getting over the toll last year took on my mind and body. I'm really enjoying the new training methods and trying something a little different. It's the lowest risk year to try something.\"Potter is tied with Olympic champion Beaugrand on 2,925 points but insists Sunday's finale in Wollangong is \"not a two-horse-race.There is a gap of more than 200 points to the chasing pack led by Jeanne Lehair, ahead of Lisa Tertsch and Leonie Periault, with 1,250 points on offer to the winner in Australia.The Scot will be cheered on by several family members - including two aunts who live nearby - as she takes on the 1.5km swim, 40km bike ride and 10km run.When Potter is pushing to cross the line, she will remember her friend Sam O'Shea. He died after being hit by a motorbike while cycling in France last month.She found motivation in the tragedy just days after it happened when victorious in the Czech Republic, the first of two race wins this season.\"When I was really hurting in that race and was a minute behind coming off the bike, a big part of it was to do it because I could and there was some extra motivation because of Sam,\" she said.\"It would be nice to do the same this weekend, but I just want to go out and enjoy it because I am able to.\"O'Shea, 27, the partner of fellow triathlete Lucy Byram, represented Gibraltar at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and was part of the triathlon squad in Leeds where Potter is based.\"It was a hard couple of days leading into that race. Sam was quite a big part of our training group. He was one of the coaches poolside, a bike mechanic who often sorted my bikes out. I spent many happy mornings on cafe rides with him,\" she said.\"He was very dry, fun to be around. He was a great support, kind, generous and would go out of his way to help other people. He is going be very much missed.\"It was emotional for me, for the rest of the team, just seeing how devastating it had been, especially for his loved ones. It was really tragic.\"It made me realise life is really precious and you only get one shot.\"After the weekend, Potter is setting no immediate targets although the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics is likely to be a long-term goal.\"I'm taking one season at a time. I'll get Sunday out of the way first,\" she said.\"I've achieved more than I thought I would in this sport. Nothing will match the level of pressure I felt last year. It almost seems like a bit of a relief for it to be 2025.\"I've enjoyed my racing this year. Hopefully I can hang on to that form for a couple of days.\"",
